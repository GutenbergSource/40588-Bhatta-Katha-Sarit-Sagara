<h3 class="main">Story of the porter who found a bracelet.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of
Vatsa, remained in Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; in happiness, with his
wives, and his ministers. And one day, when he was present, a merchant
living in the city, came to make a representation to his father, as he
was sitting on his throne. That merchant, of the name of Ratnadatta,
entered, announced by the warder, and bowing before the king, said as
follows: &ldquo;O king, there is a poor porter here, of the name of
Vasundhara; and suddenly he is found of late to be eating, drinking,
and bestowing alms. So, out of curiosity, I took him to my house, and
gave him food and drink to his heart&rsquo;s content, and when I had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>made him drunk. I questioned him, and he gave me
this answer, &lsquo;I obtained from the door of the king&rsquo;s palace
a bracelet with splendid jewels, and I picked out one jewel and sold
it. And I sold it for a <i>lakh</i> of <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> to a
merchant named Hira&#7751;yagupta; this is how I come to be living in
comfort at present.&rdquo; When he had said this, he shewed me that
bracelet, which was marked with the king&rsquo;s name, and therefore I
have come to inform your majesty of the circumstance.&rdquo; When the
king of Vatsa heard that, he had the porter and the merchant of
precious jewels summoned with all courtesy, and when he saw the
bracelet, he said of himself; &ldquo;Ah! I remember, this bracelet
slipped from my arm when I was going round the city.&rdquo; And the
courtiers asked the porter, &ldquo;Why did you, when you had got hold
of a bracelet marked with the king&rsquo;s name, conceal it?&rdquo; He
replied, &ldquo;I am one who gets his living by carrying burdens, and
how am I to know the letters of the king&rsquo;s name? When I got hold
of it, I appropriated it, being burnt up with the misery of
poverty.&rdquo; When he said this, the jewel-merchant, being reproached
for keeping the jewel, said&mdash;&ldquo;I bought it in the market,
without putting any pressure on the man, and there was no royal mark
upon it, though now it is said that it belongs to the king. And he has
taken five thousand of the price, the rest is with me.&rdquo; When
<span class="corr" id="xd27e2341" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
who was present, heard this speech of Hira&#7751;yagupta&rsquo;s, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;No one is in fault in this matter. What can we say
against the porter who does not know his letters? Poverty makes men
steal, and who ever gave up what he had found? And the merchant who
bought it from him cannot be blamed.&rdquo; The king when he heard this
decision of his prime minister&rsquo;s, approved it. And he took back
his jewel from the merchant, paying him the five thousand
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, which had been spent by the porter, and he
set the porter at liberty, after taking back his bracelet, and he,
having consumed his five thousand, went free from anxiety to his own
house. And the king, though in the bottom of his heart he hated that
merchant Ratnadatta, as being a man who ruined those that reposed
confidence in him, honoured him for his service. When they had all
departed, Vasantaka came before the king, and said, &ldquo;Ah! when men
are cursed by destiny, even the wealth they obtain departs, for the
incident of the inexhaustible pitcher has happened to this
porter.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For you must know that there lived long ago, in the
city of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, a man of the name of &#346;ubhadatta,
and he every day carried in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>load of wood from the forest, and sold
it, and so maintained his household. Now one day he went to a distant
forest, and, as it happened, he saw there four Yakshas with heavenly
ornaments and dresses. The Yakshas, seeing he was terrified, kindly
asked him of his circumstances, and finding out that he was poor, they
conceived pity for him, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Remain here as a servant
in our house, we will support your family for you without trouble on
your part.&rdquo; When &#346;ubhadatta heard that, he agreed, and
remained with them, and he supplied them with requisites for bathing
and performed other menial offices for them. When the time for eating
came, those Yakshas said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Give us food from this
inexhaustible pitcher.&rdquo; But he hesitated, seeing that it was
empty, and then the Yakshas again said to him,
smiling&mdash;&ldquo;&#346;ubhadatta, do you not understand? Put your
hand in the pitcher, and you will obtain whatever you want, for this is
a pitcher that supplies whatever is required.&rdquo; When he heard
that, he put his hand in the pitcher, and immediately he beheld all the
food and drink that could be required. And &#346;ubhadatta out of that
store supplied them and ate himself.</p>
<p>Thus waiting on the Yakshas every day with devotion and awe,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e2380" title=
"Source: Subhadatta">&#346;ubhadatta</span> remained in their presence
anxious about his family. But his sorrowing family was comforted by
them in a dream, and this kindness on their part made him happy. At the
termination of one month the Yakshas said to him, &ldquo;We are pleased
with this devotion of yours, we will grant you a boon, say what it
shall be.&rdquo; When he heard that, he said to them, &ldquo;Then give
me this inexhaustible pitcher.&rdquo; Then the Yakshas said to him,
&ldquo;You will not be able to keep it, for, if broken, it departs at
once, so choose some other boon.&rdquo; Though they warned him in these
words, &#346;ubhadatta would not choose any other boon, so they gave
him that inexhaustible pitcher. Then &#346;ubhadatta bowed before them
delighted, and, taking that pitcher, quickly returned to his house, to
the joy of his relations. Then he took out of that pitcher food and
drink, and in order to conceal the secret, he placed them in other
vessels, and consumed them with his relations. And as he gave up
carrying burdens, and enjoyed all kinds of delights, his kinsmen one
day said to him, when he was drunk; &ldquo;How did you manage to
acquire the means of all this enjoyment?&rdquo; He was too much puffed
up with pride to tell them plainly, but taking the wish-granting
pitcher on his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>shoulder, he began to dance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2385src" href="#xd27e2385" name="xd27e2385src">4</a> And as he
was dancing, the inexhaustible pitcher slipped from his shoulder, as
his feet tripped with over-abundance of intoxication, and falling on
the ground, was broken in pieces. And immediately it was mended again,
and reverted to its original possessors, but &#346;ubhadatta was
reduced to his former condition, and filled with despondency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that these unfortunate persons, whose intellects
are destroyed with the vice of drinking, and other vices, and with
infatuation, cannot keep wealth, even when they have obtained
it.&rdquo; When the king of Vatsa had heard this amusing story of the
inexhaustible pitcher, he rose up, and bathed, and set about the other
duties of the day. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta also bathed, and took
food with his father, and at the end of the day went with his friends
to his own house. There he went to bed at night, but could not sleep,
and Marubh&uacute;ti said to him in the hearing of the ministers:
&ldquo;I know, it is love of a slave-girl that prevents your summoning
your wives, and you have not summoned the slave-girl, so you cannot
sleep. But why in spite of your better knowledge do you still fall in
love with <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i>? For they have no goodness of
character; in proof that they have not, hear the following

<p class="first">There is in this country a great and opulent city

the rich merchant, who had no other son but him, seeing that he was on

"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, whose name was
Yamajihv&aacute;. There he saw that <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, with massive jaw, and long
teeth, and snub nose, instructing her daughter in the following
words&mdash;&ldquo;Every one is valued on account of wealth, a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> especially; and <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> who fall
in love do not obtain wealth, therefore a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> should
abandon passion. For rosy red, love&rsquo;s proper hue, is the
harbinger of eclipse to the <i>het&aelig;ra</i> as to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>the evening
twilight; a properly trained <i>het&aelig;ra</i> should exhibit love
without sincerity, like a well-trained actress. With that she should
gain a man&rsquo;s affections, then she should extract from him all his
wealth, when he is ruined, she should finally abandon him, but if he
should recover his wealth, she should take him back into favour. A
<i>het&aelig;ra</i>, like a hermit, is the same towards a young man, a
child, an old man, a handsome man, and a deformed man, and so she
always attains the principal object of existence.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2438src" href="#xd27e2438" name="xd27e2438src">5</a>
While the <i lang="sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> was
delivering this lesson to her daughter, Ratnavarman approached her, and
after she had welcomed him, he took a seat by her side. And he said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Reverend mother, teach my son this skill of the
<i>het&aelig;ra</i>, in order that he may become clever in it. And I
will give you a thousand <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> by way of
recompense.&rdquo; When the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> heard his desire, she
consented, and he paid the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and made over
his son &Iacute;&#347;varavarman to her, and then returned home.</p>
<p>Then &Iacute;&#347;varavarman, in the course of one year, learned in
the house of Yamajihv&aacute; all the graceful accomplishments, and
then returned to his father&rsquo;s house. And after he had attained
sixteen years, he said to his father&mdash;&ldquo;Wealth gives us
religion and love, wealth gives us consideration and renown.&rdquo;
When his father heard this, he exclaimed in approval, &ldquo;It is even
so,&rdquo; and being delighted, he gave him five <i>crores</i> by way
of capital. The son took it, and set out on an auspicious day with a
caravan, with the object of journeying to Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa. And
on the way he reached a town named K&aacute;nchanapura, and there he
encamped in a garden, at a short distance outside the town. And after
bathing and anointing himself, the young man entered the town, and went
to a temple to see a spectacle. And there he saw a dancing-girl, of the
name of Sundar&iacute;, dancing, like a wave of the sea of
beauty<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2462src" href="#xd27e2462" name=
"xd27e2462src">6</a> tossed up by the wind of youth. And the moment he
saw her, he became so devoted to her, that the instructions of the
<i lang="sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> fled far from him, as
if in anger. At the end of the dance, he sent a friend to solicit her,
and she bowed and said&mdash;&ldquo;I am highly favoured.&rdquo; And
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman left vigilant guards in his camp, to watch
over his treasure, and went himself to the house of that
Sundar&iacute;. And when he came, her mother, named
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;, honoured him with the various rites of
hospitality which became the occasion. And at nightfall she introduced
him into a chamber with a canopy of flashing jewels and a bed. There he
passed the night with Sundar&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2468src" href="#xd27e2468" name="xd27e2468src">7</a> whose name
expressed her nature, and who was skilled in all movements of the
dance. And the next day he could not bring himself to part from her, as
she shewed great affection for him, and never left his side. And the
young merchant gave her twenty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span><i>lakhs</i> of gold and jewels in
those two days. But Sundar&iacute;, with a false affectation of
disinterestedness, refused to take them, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I have
obtained much wealth, but I never found a man like you; since I have
obtained you, what should I do with wealth?&rdquo; But her mother
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;, whose only child she was, said to her,
&ldquo;Henceforth, whatever wealth belongs to us, is as much his as his
own property, so take it, my daughter, as a contribution to our common
stock, what harm is there in that?&rdquo; When Sundar&iacute;&rsquo;s
mother said this to her, she took it with affected unwillingness, and
the foolish &Iacute;&#347;varavarman thought she was really in love
with him. While the merchant remained in her house, charmed by her
beauty, her dancing, and singing, two months passed, and in course of
time he bestowed upon her two <i>crores</i>.</p>
<p>Then his friend, named Arthadatta, of his own accord came to him and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Friend, has all that training of yours, though
painfully acquired from the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, proved useless, now that the
occasion has presented itself, as skill in the use of weapons does to a
coward, in that you believe that there is sincerity in this love of a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i>? Is water ever really found in desert-mirages? So
let us go before all your wealth is consumed, for, if your father were
to hear of it, he would be very angry.&rdquo; When his friend said this
to him, the merchant&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;It is true that no
reliance can be placed upon <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> as a rule, but
Sundar&iacute; is not like the rest of her class, for, if she were to
lose sight of me for a moment, my friend, she would die. So do you
break it to her, if we must in any case go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this to Arthadatta, Arthadatta said to Sundar&iacute;,
in the presence of &Iacute;&#347;varavarman and her mother
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;, &ldquo;You entertain extraordinary affection
for &Iacute;&#347;varavarman, but he must certainly go on a trading
expedition to Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa immediately. There he will
obtain so much wealth, that he will come and live with you in happiness
all his life, consent to it, my friend.&rdquo; When Sundar&iacute;
heard this, she gazed on the face of &Iacute;&#347;varavarman with
tears in her eyes and assumed despondency, and said to Arthadatta,
&ldquo;What am I to say? you gentlemen know best. Who can rely on any
one before seeing the end? Never mind! Let fate deal with me as it
will!&rdquo; When she said this, her mother said to her, &ldquo;Do not
be grieved, control yourself; your lover will certainly return when he
has made his fortune; he will not abandon you.&rdquo; In these words
her mother consoled her, but made an agreement with her, and had a net
secretly prepared in a well, that lay in the road they must take. And
then &Iacute;&#347;varavarman&rsquo;s mind was in a state of tremulous
agitation about parting, and Sundar&iacute;, as if out of grief, took
but little food and drink. And she shewed no inclination for singing,
music, or dancing, but she was consoled by &Iacute;&#347;varavarman
with various affectionate attentions.</p>
<p>Then, on the day named by his friend, &Iacute;&#347;varavarman set
out from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>house of Sundar&iacute;, after the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> had offered a prayer for his
success. And Sundar&iacute; followed him weeping, with her mother,
outside the city, as far as the well in which the net had been
stretched. There he made Sundar&iacute; turn back, and he was
proceeding on his journey, when she flung herself into the well on the
top of the net. Then a loud cry was heard from her mother, from the
female slaves, and all the attendants, &ldquo;Ah! my daughter! Ah!
mistress!&rdquo; That made the merchant&rsquo;s son and his friend turn
round, and when he heard that his beloved had thrown herself into a
well, he was for a moment stupefied with grief. And
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;, lamenting with loud cries, made her servants,
who were attached to her, and in the secret, go down into the well.
They let themselves down by means of ropes, and exclaiming,
&ldquo;Thank heaven, she is alive, she is alive,&rdquo; they brought up
Sundar&iacute; from the well. When she was brought up, she assumed the
appearance of one nearly dead, and after she had mentioned the name of
the merchant&rsquo;s son, who had returned, she slowly began to cry.
But he, being comforted, took her to her house in great delight,
accompanied by his attendants, returning there himself. And having made
up his mind that the love of Sundar&iacute; was to be relied on, and
considering that, by obtaining her, he had obtained the real end of his
birth, he once more gave up the idea of continuing his journey. And
when he had taken up his abode there, determined to remain, his friend
said to him once more, &ldquo;My friend, why have you ruined yourself
by infatuation? Do not rely on the love of Sundar&iacute; simply
because she flung herself into a well, for the treacherous schemes of a
<i lang="sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> are not to be fathomed
even by Providence. And what what will you say to your father, when you
have spent all your property, or where will you go? So leave this place
even at this eleventh hour, if your mind is sound.&rdquo; When the
merchant&rsquo;s son heard this speech of his friend&rsquo;s, he paid
no attention to it, and in another month he spent those other three
<i>crores</i>. Then he was stripped of his all; and the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> Makaraka&#7789;&iacute; had
him seized by the back of the neck and turned out of
Sundar&iacute;&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But Arthadatta and the others quickly returned to their own city,
and told the whole story, as it happened, to his father. His father
Ratnavarman, that prince of merchants, was much grieved when he heard
it, and in great distress went to the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> Yamajihv&aacute;, and said to
her, &ldquo;Though you received a large salary, you taught my son so
badly, that Makaraka&#7789;&iacute; has with ease stripped him of all
his wealth.&rdquo; When he had said this, he told her all the story of
his son. Then the old <i lang="sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>
Yamajihv&aacute; said: &ldquo;Have your son brought back here; I will
enable him to strip Makaraka&#7789;&iacute; of all her wealth.&rdquo;
When the <i lang="sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>
Yamajihv&aacute; made this promise, Ratnavarman quickly sent off that
moment his son&rsquo;s well-meaning friend Arthadatta with a message,
to bring him, and to take at the same time means for his subsistence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>So Arthadatta went back to that city of K&aacute;nchanapura, and
told the whole message to &Iacute;&#347;varavarman. And he went on to
say to him&mdash;&ldquo;Friend, you would not do what I advised you, so
you have now had personal experience of the untrustworthy dispositions
of <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i>. After you had given that five crores, you
were ejected neck and crop. What wise man looks for love in
<i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> or for oil in sand? Or why do you put out of
sight this unalterable nature of things?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2530src" href="#xd27e2530" name="xd27e2530src">8</a> A man is
wise, self-restrained, and possesses happiness, only so long as he does
not fall within the range of woman&rsquo;s cajoleries. So return to
your father and appease his wrath.&rdquo; With these words Arthadatta
quickly induced him to return, and encouraging him, led him into the
presence of his father. And his father, out of love for his only son,
spoke kindly to him, and again took him to the house of
Yamajihv&aacute;. And when she questioned him, he told his whole story
by the mouth of Arthadatta, down to the circumstance of
Sundar&iacute;&rsquo;s flinging herself into the well, and how he lost
his wealth. Then Yamajihv&aacute; said&mdash;&ldquo;I indeed am to
blame, because I forgot to teach him this trick. For
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute; stretched a net in the well, and Sundar&iacute;
flung herself upon that, so she was not killed. Still there is a remedy
in this case.&rdquo; Having said this, the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> made her female slaves bring
her monkey named &Aacute;la. And in their presence she gave the monkey
her thousand <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Swallow
these,&rdquo; and the monkey, being trained to swallow money, did so.
Then she said, &ldquo;Now, my son give twenty to him, twenty-five to
him, and sixty to him, and a hundred to him.&rdquo; And the monkey, as
often as Yamajihv&aacute; told him to pay a sum, brought up the exact
number of <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and gave them as
commanded.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2549src" href="#xd27e2549" name=
"xd27e2549src">9</a> And after Yamajihv&aacute; had shewn this device
of &Aacute;la, she said to &Iacute;&#347;varavarman, &ldquo;Now take
with you this young monkey. And repair again to the house of
Sundar&iacute;, and keep asking him day by day for sums of money, which
you have secretly made him swallow. And Sundar&iacute;, when she sees
&Aacute;la, resembling in his powers the wishing-stone, will beg for
him, and will give you all she has so as to obtain possession of the
ape, and clasp him to her bosom. And after you have got her wealth,
make him swallow enough money for two days, and give him to her, and
then depart to a distance without delay.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>After Yamajihv&aacute; had said this, she gave that ape to
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman, and his father gave him two <i>crores</i> by
way of capital. And with the ape and the money he went once more to
K&aacute;nchanapura, and despatching a messenger on in front, he
entered the house of Sundar&iacute;. Sundar&iacute; welcomed him as if
he were an incarnation of perseverance, which includes in itself all
means for attaining an end, and his friend with him, embracing him
round the neck, and making other demonstrations. Then
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman, having gained her confidence, said to
Arthadatta in her presence in the house: &ldquo;Go, and bring
&Aacute;la.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and went and brought
the monkey. And as the monkey had before swallowed a thousand
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, he said to him, &ldquo;&Aacute;la, my son,
give us to-day three hundred <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> for our eating
and drinking, and a hundred for betel and other expenses, and give one
hundred to our mother Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;, and a hundred to the
Br&aacute;hmans, and give the rest of the thousand to
Sundar&iacute;.&rdquo; When &Iacute;&#347;varavarman said this, the
monkey brought up the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> he had before
swallowed, to the amounts ordered, and gave them for the various
objects required.</p>
<p>So by this artifice &Aacute;la was made to supply every day the
necessary expenses, for the period of a fortnight, and in the meanwhile
Makaraka&#7789;&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2581src" href=
"#xd27e2581" name="xd27e2581src">10</a> and Sundar&iacute; began to
think; &ldquo;Why this is a very wishing-stone which he has got hold of
in the form of an ape, which gives every day a hundred
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>; if he would only give it us, all our
desires would be accomplished.&rdquo; Having thus debated in private
with her mother, Sundar&iacute; said to that &Iacute;&#347;varavarman,
when he was sitting at his ease after dinner,&mdash;&ldquo;If you
really are well pleased with me, give me &Aacute;la.&rdquo; But when
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman heard that, he answered laughingly, &ldquo;He
is my father&rsquo;s all in the world, and it is not proper to give him
away.&rdquo; When he said this, Sundar&iacute; said to him again,
&ldquo;Give him me and I will give you five <i>crores</i>.&rdquo;
Thereupon &Iacute;&#347;varavarman said with an air of decision,
&ldquo;If you were to give me all your property, or indeed this city,
it would not do to give him you, much less for your
<i>crores</i>.&rdquo; When Sundar&iacute; heard this, she said,
&ldquo;I will give you all I possess; but give me this ape, otherwise
my mother will be angry with me.&rdquo; And thereupon she clung to
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman&rsquo;s feet. Then Arthadatta and the others
said, &ldquo;Give it her, happen what will.&rdquo; Then
&Iacute;&#347;varavarman promised to give it her, and he spent the day
with the delighted Sundar&iacute;. And the next day he gave to
Sundar&iacute;, at her earnest entreaties, that ape, which had in
secret been made to swallow two thousand <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>,
and he immediately took by way of payment all the wealth in her house,
and went off quickly to Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa to trade.</p>
<p>And to Sundar&iacute;&rsquo;s delight, the monkey &Aacute;la, when
asked, gave her regularly a thousand <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> for
two days. But on the third day he did <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>not give her anything,
though coaxed to do it, then Sundar&iacute; struck the ape with her
fist. And the monkey, being beaten, sprang up in a rage, and bit and
scratched the faces of Sundar&iacute; and her mother, who were
thrashing him. Then the mother, whose face was streaming with blood,
flew in a passion and beat the ape with sticks, till he died on the
spot. When Sundar&iacute; saw that he was dead, and reflected that all
her wealth was gone, she was ready to commit suicide for grief, and so
was her mother. And when the people of the town heard the story, they
laughed and said, &ldquo;Because Makaraka&#7789;&iacute; took away this
man&rsquo;s wealth by means of a net, he in his turn has stripped her
of all her property, like a clever fellow that he is, by means of a
pet; she was sharp enough to net him, but did not detect the net laid
for herself. Then Sundar&iacute;, with her scratched face and vanished
wealth, was with difficulty restrained by her relations from destroying
herself, and so was her mother. And &Iacute;&#347;varavarman soon
returned from Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa to the house of his father in
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a. And when his father saw him returned, having
acquired enormous wealth, he rewarded the <i lang=
"sa-latn">ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> Yamajihv&aacute; with
treasure, and made a great feast. And &Iacute;&#347;varavarman, seeing
the matchless deceitfulness of <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i>, became
disgusted with their society, and taking a wife remained in his own
house.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2612src" href="#xd27e2612" name=
"xd27e2612src">11</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, king, that there never dwells in the minds of
<i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> even an atom of truth, unalloyed with
treachery, so a man who desires prosperity should not take pleasure in
them, as their society is only to be gained by the wealthy, any more
than in uninhabited woods to be crossed only with a caravan.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2623src" href="#xd27e2623" name=
"xd27e2623src">12</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard, from the mouth of
Marubh&uacute;ti, the above story, word for word, of &Aacute;la and the
net, he and Gomukha approved it, and laughed heartily.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vikramasinha, the het&aelig;ra, and the
young Br&aacute;hman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na a king named
Vikramasinha, who was made by Providence a lion in courage, so that his
name expressed his nature. He had a queen of lofty lineage, beautiful
and beloved, whose lovely form was her only ornament, and she was
called &#346;a&#347;ilekh&aacute;. Once on a time, when he was in his
city, five or six of his relations combined together, and going to his
palace, surrounded him. Their names were Mah&aacute;bha&#7789;a,
V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu, Sub&aacute;hu, Subha&#7789;a and
Prat&aacute;p&aacute;ditya, all powerful kings. The king&rsquo;s
minister was proceeding to try the effect of conciliation on them, but
the king set him aside, and went out to fight with them. And when the
two armies had begun to exchange showers of arrows, the king himself
entered the fray, mounted on an elephant, confiding in his might. And
when the five kings, Mah&aacute;bha&#7789;a and the others, saw him,
seconded only by his bow, dispersing the army of his enemies, they all
attacked him together. And as the numerous force of the five kings made
an united charge, the force of Vikramasinha, being inferior in number,
was broken. Then his minister Anantagu&#7751;a, who was at his side,
said, &ldquo;Our force is routed for the present, there is no chance of
victory to-day, and you would engage in this conflict with an
overwhelming force in spite of my advice, so now at the last moment do
what I recommend you, in order that the affair may turn out
prosperously; come now, descend from your elephant, and mount a horse,
and let us go to another country; if you live, you will conquer your
enemies on some future occasion.&rdquo; When the minister said this,
the king readily got down from his elephant, and mounted on a horse,
and left his army in company with him. And in course of time, the king,
in disguise, reached with his minister the city of Ujjayin&iacute;.
There he entered with his minister the house of a <i>het&aelig;ra</i>,
named Kumudik&aacute;, renowned for her wealth; and she, seeing him
suddenly entering the house, thought, &ldquo;This is a distinguished
hero that has come to my house: and his majesty and the marks on his
body shew him to be a great king, so my desire is sure to be attained
if I can make him my instrument.&rdquo; Having thus reflected,
Kumudik&aacute; rose up and welcomed him, and entertained him
hospitably, and immediately she said to the king, who was
wearied,&mdash;&ldquo;I am fortunate, to-day the good deeds of my
former life have borne fruit, in that Your Majesty has hallowed my
house by coming to it in person. So by this favour Your Majesty has
made me your slave. The hundred elephants, and two myriads of horses,
and house full of jewels, which belong to me, are entirely at your
majesty&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo; Having said this, she provided the
king and his minister with baths and other luxuries, all in magnificent
style.</p>
<p>Then the wearied king lived in her palace, at his ease, with her,
who put her wealth at his disposal. He consumed her substance and gave
it away to petitioners, and she did not show any anger against him on
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>account, but was rather pleased at it. Thereupon
the king was delighted, thinking that she was really attached to him,
but his minister Anantagu&#7751;a, who was with him, said to him in
secret: &ldquo;Your majesty, <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> are not to be
depended upon, though, I must confess, I cannot guess the reason why
Kumudik&aacute; shews you love.&rdquo; When the king heard this speech
of his, he answered him: &ldquo;Do not speak thus; Kumudik&aacute;
would even lay down her life for my sake. If you do not believe it, I
will give you a convincing proof.&rdquo; After the king had said this
to his minister, he adopted this artifice; he took little to eat and
little to drink, and so gradually attenuated his body, and at last he
made himself as dead, without movement, prostrate on the ground. Then
his attendants put him on a bier, and carried him to the
burning-<i>ghat</i> with lamentations, while Anantagu&#7751;a affected
a grief which he did not feel. And Kumudik&aacute;, out of grief, came
and ascended the funeral pyre with him, though her relations tried to
prevent her. But before the fire was lighted, the king, perceiving that
Kumudik&aacute; had followed him, rose up with a yawn. And all his
attendants took him home with Kumudik&aacute; to his lodging,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Fortunate is it that our king has been restored to
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a feast was made, and the king recovered his normal condition,
and said in private to his minister,&mdash;&ldquo;Did you observe the
devotion of Kumudik&aacute;?&rdquo; Then the minister
said,&mdash;&ldquo;I do not believe even now. You may be sure that
there is some reason for her conduct, so we must wait to get to the
bottom of the matter. But let us reveal to her who we are, in order
that we may obtain a force granted by her, and another force supplied
by your ally, and so smite our enemies in battle.&rdquo; While he was
saying this, the spy, that had been secretly sent out, returned, and
when questioned, answered as follows; &ldquo;Your enemies have overrun
the country, and queen &#346;a&#347;ilekh&aacute;, having heard from
the people a false report of your majesty&rsquo;s death, has entered
the fire.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he was smitten by the
thunderbolt of grief, and lamented&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! my queen! Alas,
chaste lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kumudik&aacute; at last came to know the truth, and after
consoling the king Vikramasinha, she said to him; &ldquo;Why did not
the king give me the order long ago? Now punish your enemies with my
wealth and my forces.&rdquo; When she said this, the king augmented the
force by means of her wealth, and repaired to a powerful king who was
an ally of his. And he marched with his forces and those forces of his
own, and after killing those five enemies in battle, he got possession
of their kingdoms into the bargain. Then he was delighted, and said to
Kumudik&aacute; who accompanied him; &ldquo;I am pleased with you, so
tell me what I can do to gratify you.&rdquo; Then Kumudik&aacute;
said&mdash;&ldquo;If you are really pleased, my lord, then extract from
my heart this one thorn that has long remained there. I have an
affection for a Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son, of the name of
&#346;r&iacute;dhara, in Ujjayin&iacute;, whom the king has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>thrown into prison for a very small fault, so
deliver him out of the king&rsquo;s hand. Because I saw by your royal
marks, that your majesty was a glorious hero, and destined to be
successful, and able to effect this object of mine, I waited on you
with devoted attentions. Moreover, I ascended that pyre out of despair
of attaining my object, considering that life was useless without that
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son. When the <i>het&aelig;ra</i> said this, the
king answered her; &ldquo;I will accomplish it for you, fair one, do
not despair.&rdquo; After saying this, he called to mind his
minister&rsquo;s speech, and thought&mdash;&ldquo;Anantagu&#7751;a was
right, when he said that <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> were not to be
depended upon. But I must gratify the wish of this miserable
creature.&rdquo; Thus resolved, he went with his troops to
Ujjayin&iacute;, and after getting &#346;r&iacute;dhara set at liberty,
and giving him much wealth, he made Kumudik&aacute; happy by uniting
her with her beloved there. And after returning to his city, he never
disobeyed the advice of his minister, and so in time he came to enjoy
the whole earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, the hearts of <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> are
fathomless and hard to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gomukha stopped, after he had told this story. But then
Tapantaka said in the presence of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, you must never repose any
confidence at all in women, for they are all light, even those that,
being married or unmarried, dwell in their father&rsquo;s house, as
well as those that are <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> by profession. I will
tell you a wonder which happened in this very place, hear it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the faithless wife who burnt herself with her

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a merchant in this very city named
Balavarman, and he had a wife named Chandra&#347;r&iacute;, and she
beheld from a window a handsome merchant&rsquo;s son, of the name of
&#346;&iacute;lahara, and she sent her female friend to invite him to
her house, and there she used to have assignations with him in secret.
And while she was in the habit of meeting him there every day, her
attachment to him was discovered by all her friends and relations. But
her husband Balavarman was the only one who did not discover that she
was unchaste; very often men blinded by affection do not discover the
wickedness of their wives.</p>
<p>Then a burning fever seized Balavarman, and the merchant
consequently was soon reduced to a very low state. But, though he was
in this state, his wife went every day to her friend&rsquo;s house, to
meet her paramour. And the next day, while she was there, her husband
died. And on hearing of it she returned, quickly taking leave of her
lover. And out of grief for her husband, she ascended the pyre with his
body, being firmly resolved, though her attendants, who knew her
character, tried to dissuade her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2685src"

<p>&ldquo;Thus is the way of a woman&rsquo;s heart truly hard to
understand. They fall in love with strange men, and die when separated
from their husbands.&rdquo; When Tapantaka said this, Hari&#347;ikha
said in his turn, &ldquo;Have you not heard what happened in this way

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of old time there lived in a village a householder,
named Devad&aacute;sa, and he had a wife named with good cause
Duh&#803;&#347;&iacute;l&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2703src"
href="#xd27e2703" name="xd27e2703src">2</a> And the neighbours knew
that she was in love with another man. Now, once on a time,
Devad&aacute;sa went to the king&rsquo;s court on some business. And
his wife, who wished to have him murdered, took advantage of the
occasion to bring her paramour, whom she concealed on the roof of the
house. And in the dead of night she had her husband Devad&aacute;sa
killed by that paramour, when he was asleep. And she dismissed her
paramour, and remained quiet until the morning, when she went out, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;My husband has been killed by robbers.&rdquo; Then
his relations came there, and after they had seen his body, they said,
&ldquo;If he was killed by thieves, why did they not carry off
anything?&rdquo; After they had said this, they asked her young son,
who was there, &ldquo;Who killed your father?&rdquo; Then he said
plainly; &ldquo;A man had gone up on the roof here in the day, he came
down in the night, and killed my father before my eyes; but first my
mother took me and rose up from my father&rsquo;s side.&rdquo; When the
boy said this, the dead man&rsquo;s relations knew that Devad&aacute;sa
had been killed by his wife&rsquo;s paramour, and they searched him
out, and put him to death then and there, and they adopted that boy and
banished Duh&#803;&#347;&iacute;l&aacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, a woman, whose heart is fixed on another man,
infallibly kills like the snake.&rdquo; When Hari&#347;ikha said this,
Gomukha said again&mdash;&ldquo;Why should we tell any out-of-the-way

the servant of the king of Vatsa.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Vajras&aacute;ra whose wife cut off his nose
and ears.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He, being brave and handsome, had a beautiful wife
that came from M&aacute;lava, whom he loved more than his own body.
Once on a time his wife&rsquo;s father, longing to see her, came in
person, accompanied by his son, from M&aacute;lava, to invite him and
her. Then Vajras&aacute;ra entertained him, and informed the king, and
went, as he had been invited to do, to M&aacute;lava with his wife and
his father-in-law. And after he had rested a month only in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, he came back here to attend upon the king,
but that wife of his remained there. Then, after some days had passed,
suddenly a friend of the name of Krodhana came to him, and
said:&mdash;&ldquo;Why have you ruined your family by leaving your wife
in her father&rsquo;s house? For the abandoned woman has there formed a
connexion with another man. This was told me to-day by a trustworthy
person who came from that place. Do not suppose that it is untrue;
punish her, and marry another.&rdquo; When Krodhana had said this, he
went away, and Vajras&aacute;ra stood bewildered for a moment, and then
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I suspect this may be true; otherwise, why did
she not come back, though I sent a man to summon her? So I will go
myself to bring her, and see what the state of the case is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having formed this resolution, he went to M&aacute;lava, and after
taking leave of his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, he set out
with his wife. And after he had gone a long distance, he eluded his
followers by a trick, and going by the wrong path, entered with his
wife a dense wood. He sat down in the middle of it, and said to her,
out of hearing of any one: &ldquo;I have heard from a trustworthy
friend, that you are in love with another, and when I, remaining at
home, sent for you, you did not come; so tell me the truth; if you do
not, I will punish you.&rdquo; When she heard this, she said: &ldquo;If
this is your intention, why do you ask me? Do what you like.&rdquo;
When Vajras&aacute;ra heard this contemptuous speech of hers, he was
angry and tied her up, and began to beat her with creepers. But while
he was stripping off her clothes, he felt his passion renewed, and
asked her to forgive him, whereupon she said; &ldquo;I will, if I may
tie you up and beat you with creepers, in the same way as you tied me
up and beat me, but not otherwise.&rdquo; Vajras&aacute;ra, whose heart
was made like stubble by love, consented, for he was blinded by
passion. Then she bound him firmly, hand and foot, to a tree, and, when
he was bound, she cut off his ears and nose with his own sword, and the
wicked woman took his sword and clothes, and disguising herself as a
man, departed whither she would.</p>
<p>But <span class="corr" id="xd27e2721" title=
"Source: Vaj&#7771;as&aacute;ra">Vajras&aacute;ra</span>, with his nose
and ears cut off, remained there, depressed by great loss of blood, and
loss of self-respect. Then a certain benevolent physician, who was
wandering through the wood in search of healing herbs, saw him, and out
of compassion unbound him, and brought him home to his house. And
Vajras&aacute;ra, having been brought round by him, slowly returned to
his own house, but he did not find that wicked wife, though he sought
for her. And he described the whole occurrence to Krodhana, and he
related it in the presence of the king of Vatsa; and all the people in
the king&rsquo;s court mocked him, saying, that his wife had justly
taken away his man&rsquo;s dress and suitably punished him, because he
had lost all manly spirit and faculty of just resentment, and so become
a woman. But in spite of their ridicule he remains there with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=

confidence, your Royal Highness, can be placed in women?</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Sinhabala and his fickle wife.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Formerly there dwelt in the Deccan a king, of the name
of Sinhabala. And his wife named Kaly&aacute;&#7751;avat&iacute;, the
daughter of a prince of M&aacute;lava, was dear to him above all the
women of his harem. And the king ruled the realm with her as consort,
but once on a time he was expelled from his kingdom by his powerful
relations, who banded together against him. And then the king,
accompanied by the queen, with his weapons and but few attendants, set
out for the house of his father-in-law in M&aacute;lava.</p>
<p>And as he was going along through a forest, which lay in his road, a
lion charged him, and the hero easily cut it in two with a stroke of
his sword. And when a wild elephant came at him trumpeting, he circled
round it and cut off with his sword its trunk and feet, and stripped it
of its jewel, and killed it. And alone he dispersed the hosts of
bandits like lotuses, and trampled them, as the elephant, lord of the
forest, tramples the beds of white water-lilies. Thus he accomplished
the journey, and his wonderful courage was seen, and so he reached
M&aacute;lava, and then this sea of valour said to his wife: &ldquo;You
must not tell in your father&rsquo;s house this that happened to me on
the journey, it will bring shame to me, my queen, for what is there
laudable in courage displayed by a man of the military caste?&rdquo;
After he had given her this injunction, he entered his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house with her, and when eagerly questioned by
him, told his story. His father-in-law honoured him, and gave him
elephants and horses, and then he repaired to a very powerful king
named Gaj&aacute;n&iacute;ka. But being intent on conquering his
enemies, he left his wife Kaly&aacute;&#7751;avat&iacute; there in her
father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Some days after he had gone, his wife, while standing at the window,
saw a certain man. The moment she saw him, he captivated her heart by
his good looks; and being drawn on by love, she immediately thought,
&ldquo;I know, no one is more handsome or more brave than my husband,
but alas! my mind is attracted towards this man. So let what must be,
be. I will have an interview with him.&rdquo; So she determined in her
own mind, and told her desire to a female attendant, who was her
confidante. And she made her bring him at night, and introduce him into
the women&rsquo;s apartments by the window, pulling him up with a rope.
When the man was introduced, he had not courage to sit boldly on the
sofa on which she was, but sat apart on a chair. The queen, when she
saw that, was despondent, thinking he was a mean man, and at that very
moment a snake, which was roaming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>about, came down from the roof.
When the man saw the snake, he sprang up quickly in fear, and taking
his bow, he killed the snake with an arrow. And when it fell dead, he
threw it out of the window, and in his delight at having escaped that
danger, the coward danced for joy. When Kaly&aacute;&#7751;avat&iacute;
saw him dancing, she was cast down, and thought to herself over and
over again: &ldquo;Alas! alas! What have I to do with this
mean-spirited coward?&rdquo; And her friend, who was a discerning
person, saw that she was disgusted, and so she went out, and quickly
returned with assumed trepidation, and said, &ldquo;Queen, your father
has come, so let this young man quickly return to his own house by the
way by which he came.&rdquo; When she said this, he went out of the
window by means of the rope, and being overpowered by fear, he fell,
but as luck would have it, he was not killed.</p>
<p>When he had gone, Kaly&aacute;&#7751;avat&iacute; said to her
confidante,&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, you have acted rightly in turning
out this low fellow.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2744src" href=
"#xd27e2744" name="xd27e2744src">3</a> You penetrated my feelings, for
my heart is vexed. My husband, after slaying tigers and lions, conceals
it through modesty, and this cowardly man, after killing a snake,
dances for joy. So why should I desert such a husband and fall in love
with a common fellow? Curse on my unstable mind, or rather curse on
women, who are like flies that leave camphor and haste to
impurity!&rdquo; The queen spent the night in these self-reproaches,
and afterwards remained waiting in her father&rsquo;s house for the
return of her husband. In the meanwhile Sinhabala, having been supplied
with another army by king Gaj&aacute;n&iacute;ka, slew those five
wicked relations<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Then
he recovered his kingdom, and at the same time brought back his wife
from her father&rsquo;s house, and after loading his father-in-law with
abundance of wealth, he ruled the earth for a long time without
opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, king, that the mind of even discerning women is
fickle, and, though they have brave and handsome husbands, wanders
hither and thither, but women of pure character are scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, had heard
this story related by Marubh&uacute;ti, he sank off into a sound sleep
and so passed the night.</p>

middle of the stars, with face like an opening lotus, with rolling eyes
like circling bees, with the swimming gait of a swan, diffusing the
perfume of a blue lotus, with dimples charming like waves, with waist
adorned with a string of pearls, like the presiding goddess of the
lovely lake in Cupid&rsquo;s garden, appearing in bodily form. And the
prince, when he saw that charming enamoured creature, a medicine potent
to revive the god of love, was disturbed like the sea, when it beholds
the orb of the moon. And he approached her, saying to his
ministers&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd27e2767" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Ah! extraordinary is the variety in
producing fair ones that is characteristic of Providence!<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> And when she looked at him
with a sidelong look tender with passion, he asked her&mdash;&ldquo;Who
are you, auspicious one, and why have you come here?&rdquo; When the
maiden heard that, she said, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a town of gold on the Him&aacute;layas, named
K&aacute;nchana&#347;&#7771;inga. In it there lives a king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Spha&#7789;ikaya&#347;as, who is just, and
kind to the wretched, the unprotected, and those who seek his aid. Know
that I am his daughter, born to him by the queen Hemaprabh&aacute;, in
consequence of a boon granted by Gaur&iacute;. And I, being the
youngest child, and having five brothers, and being dear to my father
as his life, kept by his advice propitiating Gaur&iacute; with vows and
hymns. She, being pleased, bestowed on me all the magic sciences, and
deigned to address me thus&mdash;&lsquo;Thy might in science shall be
tenfold that of thy father, and thy husband shall be
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, the future
emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas<span class="corr" id="xd27e2775"
title="Source: ?">.</span> After the consort of &#346;iva had said
this, she disappeared, and by her favour I obtained the sciences and
gradually grew up. And last night the goddess appeared to me and
commanded me&mdash;&lsquo;To-morrow, my daughter, thou must go and
visit thy husband, and thou must return here the same day, for in a
month thy father, who has long entertained this intention, will give
thee in marriage.&rsquo; The goddess, after giving me this command,
disappeared, and the night came to an end; so here I am come, your
Highness, to pay you a visit. So now I will depart.&rdquo; Having said
this, &#346;aktiya&#347;as flew up into the heaven with her attendants,
and returned to her father&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>But Narav&aacute;hanadatta, being eager to marry her, went in
disappointed, considering the month as long as a <i>yuga</i>. And
Gomukha, seeing that he was despondent, said to him, &ldquo;Listen,
prince, I will tell you a delightful story.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old time there was a city named
K&aacute;nchanapur&iacute;, and in it there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>lived a
great king named Sumanas. He was of extraordinary splendour, and
crossing difficult and inaccessible regions, he conquered the
fortresses and fastnesses of his foes. Once, as he was sitting in the
hall of assembly, the warder said to him&mdash;&ldquo;King, the
daughter of the king of the Nish&aacute;das, named
Mukt&aacute;lat&aacute;, is standing outside the door with a parrot in
a cage, accompanied by her brother V&iacute;raprabha, and wishes to see
your Majesty.&rdquo; The king said &ldquo;Let her enter,&rdquo; and,
introduced by the warder, the Bhilla maiden entered the enclosure of
the king&rsquo;s hall of assembly. And all there, when they saw her
beauty, thought&mdash;&ldquo;This is not a mortal maiden, surely this
is some heavenly nymph.&rdquo; And she bowed before the king and spoke
as follows&mdash;&ldquo;King, here is a parrot that knows the four
Vedas, called &#346;&aacute;straganja, a poet skilled in all the
sciences and in the graceful arts, and I have brought him here to-day
by the order of king Maya, so receive him.&rdquo; With these words she
handed over the parrot, and it was brought by the warder near the king,
as he had a curiosity to see it, and it recited the following <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#347;loka</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;King, this is natural, that the black-faced smoke of thy
valour should be continually increased by the windy sighs of the widows
of thy enemies, but this is strange, that the strong flame of thy
valour blazes in the ten cardinal points all the more fiercely on
account of the overflowing of the copious tears wrung from them by the
humiliation of defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the parrot had recited this &#347;loka, it began to reflect,
and said again, &ldquo;What do you wish to know? tell me from what
<i lang="sa-latn">&#347;&aacute;stra</i> I shall recite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king was much astonished, but his minister
said&mdash;&ldquo;I suspect, my lord, this is some <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7771;ishi</i> of ancient days become a parrot on account of
a curse, but owing to his piety he remembers his former birth, and so
recollects what he formerly read.&rdquo; When the ministers said this
to the king, the king said to the parrot&mdash;&ldquo;I feel curiosity,
my good parrot, tell me your story, where is your place of birth? How
comes it that in your parrot condition you know the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#347;&aacute;stras</i>? Who are you?&rdquo; Then the parrot
shed tears and slowly spoke: &ldquo;The story is sad to tell, O king,
but listen, I will tell it in obedience to thy command.<span class=

parrot.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Near the Him&aacute;layas, O king, there is a <i lang=
"sa-latn">rohin&iacute;</i> tree, which resembles the Vedas, in that
many birds take refuge in its branches that extend through the heaven,
as Br&aacute;hmans in the various branches of the sacred
tradition.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2821src" href="#xd27e2821" name=
"xd27e2821src">2</a> There a cock-parrot used to dwell with his hen,
and to that pair I was born, by the influence of my evil works in a
former life. And as soon as I was born, the hen-parrot, my mother,
died, but my old father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>put me under his wing, and fostered
me tenderly. And he continued to live there, eating what remained over
from the fruits brought by the other parrots, and giving some to
me.</p>
<p>Once on a time, there came there to hunt a terrible army of Bhillas,
making a noise with cows&rsquo; horns strongly blown; and the whole of
that great wood was like an army fleeing in rout, with terrified
antelopes for dust-stained banners, and the bushy tails of the <i lang=
"sa-latn">chamar&iacute;</i> deer, agitated in fear, resembling
<i>chowries</i>, as the host of Pulindas rushed upon it to slay various
living creatures. And after the army of &#346;avaras had spent the day
in the hunting-grounds, in the sport of death, they returned with the
loads of flesh which they had obtained. But a certain aged &#346;avara,
who had not obtained any flesh, saw the tree in the evening, and being
hungry, approached it, and he quickly climbed up it, and kept dragging
parrots and other birds from their nests, killing them, and flinging
them on the ground. And when I saw him coming near, like the minister
of Yama, I slowly crept in fear underneath the wing of my father. And
in the meanwhile the ruffian came near our nest, and dragged out my
father, and wringing his neck, flung him down on the ground at the foot
of the tree. And I fell with my father, and slipping out from
underneath his wing, I slowly crept in my fear into the grass and
leaves. Then the rascally Bhilla came down, and roasted some of the
parrots and ate them, and others he carried off to his own village.</p>
<p>Then my fear was at an end, but I spent a night long from grief, and
in the morning, when the flaming eye<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2842src" href="#xd27e2842" name="xd27e2842src">3</a> of the world
had mounted high in the heaven, I, being thirsty, went to the bank of a
neighbouring lake full of lotuses, tumbling frequently, clinging to the
earth with my wings, and there I saw on the sand of the lake a hermit,
named Mar&iacute;chi, who had just bathed, as it were my good works in
a former state of existence. He, when he saw me, refreshed me with
drops of water flung in my face, and, putting me in the hollow of a
leaf, out of pity, carried me to his hermitage. There Pulastya, the
head of the hermitage, laughed when he saw me, and being asked by the
other hermits, why he laughed, having supernatural insight, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;When I beheld this parrot, who is a parrot in
consequence of a curse, I laughed out of sorrow, but after I have said
my daily prayers, I will tell a story connected with him, which shall
cause him to remember his former birth, and the occurrences of his
former lives.&rdquo; After saying this, the hermit Pulastya rose up for
his daily prayer, and, after he had performed his daily <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>prayer,
being again solicited by the hermits, the great sage told this story
concerning me.</p>

<h3 class="main">The hermit&rsquo;s story of Somaprabha,
Manorathaprabh&aacute;, and Makarandik&aacute;, wherein it appears who
the parrot was in a former birth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in the city of Ratn&aacute;kara a king
named Jyotishprabha, who ruled the earth with supreme authority, as far
as the sea, the mine of jewels. There was born to him, by his queen
named Harshavat&iacute;, a son, whose birth was due to the favour of
&#346;iva propitiated by severe asceticism. Because the queen saw in a
dream the moon entering her mouth, the king gave his son the name of
Somaprabha. And the prince gradually grew up with ambrosial qualities,
furnishing a feast to the eyes of the subjects.</p>
<p>And his father Jyotishprabha, seeing that he was brave, young,
beloved by the subjects, and able to bear the weight of empire, gladly
anointed him crown-prince. And he gave him as minister the virtuous
Priyankara, the son of his own minister named Prabh&aacute;kara. On
that occasion M&aacute;tali descended from the heaven with a celestial
horse, and coming up to Somaprabha, said to him: &ldquo;You are a
Vidy&aacute;dhara, a friend of Indra&rsquo;s, born on earth, and he has
sent you an excellent horse named &Aacute;&#347;u&#347;ravas, the son
of Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas, in memory of his former friendship; if
you mount it, you will be invincible by your foes.&rdquo; After the
charioteer of Indra had said this, he gave Somaprabha that splendid
horse, and after receiving due honour, he flew up to heaven again.</p>
<p>Then Somaprabha spent that day pleasantly in feasting, and the next
day said to his father the king; &ldquo;My father, the duty of a
Kshatriya is not complete without a desire for conquest, so permit me
to march out to the conquest of the regions.&rdquo; When his father
Jyotishprabha heard that, he was pleased, and consented, and made
arrangements for his expedition. Then Somaprabha bowed before his
father, and marched out on an auspicious day, with his forces, for the
conquest of the regions, mounted on the horse given by Indra. And by
the help of his splendid horse, he conquered the kings of every part of
the world, and being irresistible in might, he stripped them of their
jewels. He bent his bow and the necks of his enemies at the same time;
the bow was unbent again, but the heads of his enemies were never again
uplifted.</p>
<p>Then, as he was returning in triumph, on a path which led him near
the Him&aacute;layas, he made his army encamp, and went hunting in a
wood. And as chance would have it, he saw there a Kinnara, made of a
splendid jewel, and he pursued him on his horse given by Indra, with
the object of capturing him. The Kinnara entered a cavern in the
mountain, and was lost to view, but the prince was carried far away by
that horse.</p>
<p>And when the sun, after diffusing illumination over the quarters of
the world, had reached the western peak, where he meets the evening
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>twilight, the prince, being tired, managed, though
with difficulty, to return, and he beheld a great lake, and wishing to
pass the night on its shores, he dismounted from his horse. And after
he had given grass and water to the horse, and had taken fruits and
water himself, and felt rested, he suddenly heard from a certain
quarter the sound of a song. Out of curiosity he went in the direction
of the sound, and saw at no great distance a heavenly nymph, singing in
front of a <i>linga</i> of &#346;iva. He said to himself in
astonishment, &ldquo;Who may this lovely one be?&rdquo; And she, seeing
that he was of noble appearance, said to him
bashfully&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me, who are you? How did you reach alone
this inaccessible place?&rdquo; When he heard this, he told his story,
and asked her in turn, &ldquo;Tell me, who are you and what is your
business in this wood?&rdquo; When he asked this question, the heavenly
maiden said&mdash;&ldquo;If you have any desire, noble sir, to hear my
tale, listen, I will tell it;&rdquo; after this preface she began to
speak with a gushing flood of tears.</p>

<h3 class="main">Episode of Manorathaprabh&aacute; and
Ra&#347;mimat.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is here, on the table-land of the
Him&aacute;layas, a city named K&aacute;nchan&aacute;bha, and in it
there dwells a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named
Padmak&uacute;&#7789;a. Know that I am the daughter of that king by his
queen Hemaprabh&aacute;, and that my name is Manorathaprabh&aacute;,
and my father loves me more than his life. I, by the power of my
science, used to visit, with my female companions, the isles, and the
principal mountains, and the woods, and the gardens, and after amusing
myself, I made a point of returning every day at my father&rsquo;s
meal-time, at the third watch of the day, to my palace. Once on a time
I arrived here as I was roaming about, and I saw on the shore of the
lake a hermit&rsquo;s son with his companion. And being summoned by the
splendour of his beauty, as if by a female messenger, I approached him,
and he welcomed me with a wistful look. And then I sat down, and my
friend, perceiving the feelings of both, put this question to him
through his companion, &ldquo;Who are you, noble sir, tell me?&rdquo;
And his companion said; &ldquo;Not far from here, my friend, there
lives in a hermitage a hermit named D&iacute;dhitimat. He, being
subject to a strict vow of chastity, was seen once, when he came to
bathe in this lake, by the goddess &#346;r&iacute;, who came there at
the same time. As she could not obtain him in the flesh, as he was a
strict ascetic, and yet longed for him earnestly with her mind, she
conceived a mind-born son. And she took that son to D&iacute;dhitimat,
saying to him, &lsquo;I have obtained this son by looking at you;
receive it.&rsquo; And after giving the son to the hermit,
&#346;r&iacute; disappeared. And the hermit gladly received the son, so
easily obtained, and gave him the name of Ra&#347;mimat, and gradually
reared him, and after investing him with the sacred thread, taught him
out of love all the sciences. Know that you see before you in this
young hermit that very Ra&#347;mimat the son of &#346;r&iacute;, come
here with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>me on a pleasure journey.&rdquo; When my friend
had heard this from the youth&rsquo;s friend, she, being questioned by
him in turn, told my name and descent as I have now told it to you.</p>
<p>Then I and the hermit&rsquo;s son became still more in love with one
another from hearing one another&rsquo;s descent, and while we were
lingering there, a second attendant came and said to me, &ldquo;Rise
up, your father, fair one, is waiting for you in the dining-room of the
palace.&rdquo; When I heard that, I said&mdash;&ldquo;I will return
quickly,&rdquo; and leaving the youth there, I went into the presence
of my father out of fear. And when I came out, having taken a very
little food, the first attendant came to me and said of her own accord:
&ldquo;The friend of that hermit&rsquo;s son came here, my friend, and
standing at the door of the court said to me in a state of hurried
excitement&mdash;&lsquo;Ra&#347;mimat has sent me here now, bestowing
on me the power of travelling in the air, which he inherits from his
father, to see Manorathaprabh&aacute;: he is reduced to a terrible
state by love and cannot retain his breath a moment longer, without
that mistress of his life.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The moment I heard
this, I left my father&rsquo;s palace, and, accompanied by that friend
of the hermit&rsquo;s son, who showed me the way, and my attendant, I
came here, and when I arrived here, I saw that that hermit&rsquo;s son,
separated from me, had resigned, at the rising of the moon, the nectar
of his life. So I, grieved by separation from him, was blaming my vital
frame, and longing to enter the fire with his body. But at that very
moment a man, with a body like a mass of flame, descended from the sky,
and flew up to heaven with his body.</p>
<p>Then I was desirous to hurl myself into the fire alone, but at that
moment a voice issued from the air here; &ldquo;Manorathaprabh&aacute;,
do not do this thing, for at the appointed time thou shalt be re-united
to this thy hermit&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; On hearing this, I gave up the
idea of suicide, and here I remain full of hope, waiting for him,
engaged in the worship of &#346;iva. And as for the friend of the
hermit&rsquo;s son, he has disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>When the Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden had said this, Somaprabha said to
her, &ldquo;Then, why do you remain alone, where is that female
attendant of yours?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden heard
this, she answered: &ldquo;There is a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
named Sinhavikrama, and he has a matchless daughter named
Makarandik&aacute;; she is a friend of mine, dear as my life, who
sympathizes with my grief, and she to-day sent her attendant to learn
tidings of me. So I sent back my own attendant to her, with her
attendant; it is for that reason that I am at present alone.&rdquo; As
she was saying this, she pointed out to Somaprabha her attendant
descending from heaven. And she made the attendant, after she had told
her news, strew a bed of leaves for Somaprabha, and also give grass to
his horse.</p>
<p>Then, after passing the night, they rose up in the morning, and saw
approaching a Vidy&aacute;dhara, who had descended from heaven. And
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>Vidy&aacute;dhara, whose name was Devajaya, after
sitting down, spoke thus to
Manorathaprabh&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;Manorathaprabh&aacute;, king
Sinhavikrama informs you that your friend, his daughter
Makarandik&aacute;, out of love for you, refuses to marry until you
have obtained a bridegroom. So he wishes you to go there and admonish
her, that she may be ready to marry.&rdquo; When the Vidy&aacute;dhara
maiden heard this, she prepared to go, out of regard for her friend,
and then Somaprabha said to her:&mdash;&ldquo;Virtuous one, I have a
curiosity to see the Vidy&aacute;dhara world: so take me there, and let
my horse remain here supplied with grass.&rdquo; When she heard that,
she consented, and taking her attendant with her, she flew through the
air, with Somaprabha, who was carried in the arms of Devajaya.</p>
<p>When she arrived there, Makarandik&aacute; welcomed her, and seeing
Somaprabha, asked, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; And when
Manorathaprabh&aacute; told his story, the heart of Makarandik&aacute;
was immediately captivated by him. He, for his part, thought in his
mind, deeming he had come upon Good Fortune in bodily
form&mdash;&ldquo;Who is the fortunate man destined to be her
bridegroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in confidential conversation, Manorathaprabh&aacute; put the
following question to Makarandik&aacute;; &ldquo;Fair one, why do you
not wish to be married?&rdquo; And she, when she heard this,
answered:&mdash;&ldquo;How could I desire marriage until you have
accepted a bridegroom, for you are dearer to me than life?&rdquo; When
Makarandik&aacute; said this in an affectionate manner,
Manorathaprabh&aacute; said&mdash;&ldquo;I have chosen a bridegroom,
fair one; I am waiting here in hopes of union with him.&rdquo; When she
said this, Makarandik&aacute; said&mdash;&ldquo;I will do as you
direct.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2895src" href="#xd27e2895"
name="xd27e2895src">4</a></p>
<p>Then Manorathaprabh&aacute;, seeing the real state of her feelings,
said to her, &ldquo;My friend, Somaprabha has come here as your guest,
after wandering through the world, so you must entertain him as a guest
with becoming hospitality.&rdquo; When Makarandik&aacute; heard this,
she said:&mdash;&ldquo;I have already bestowed on him, by way of
hospitality, every thing but myself, but let him accept me, if he is
willing.&rdquo; When she said this, Manorathaprabh&aacute; told their
love to her father, and arranged a marriage between them. Then
Somaprabha recovered his spirits, and delighted said to
her:&mdash;&ldquo;I must go now to your hermitage, for possibly my
army, commanded by my minister, may come there tracking my course, and
if they do not find me, they may return, suspecting something untoward.
So I will depart, and after I have learned the tidings of the host, I
will return, and certainly marry Makarandik&aacute; on an auspicious
day.&rdquo; When Manorathaprabh&aacute; heard that, she consented, and
took him back to her own hermitage, making Devajaya carry him in his
arms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile his minister Priyankara came there with the army,
tracking his footsteps. And while Somaprabha, in delight, was
recounting his adventures to his minister, whom he met there, a
messenger came from his father, with a written message that he was to
return quickly. Then, by the advice of his minister, he went with his
army back to his own city, in order not to disobey his father&rsquo;s
command, and as he started, he said to Manorathaprabh&aacute; and
Devajaya, &ldquo;I will return as soon as I have seen my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Devajaya went and informed Makarandik&aacute; of that, and in
consequence she became afflicted with the sorrow of separation. She
took no pleasure in the garden, nor in singing, nor in the society of
her ladies-in-waiting, nor did she listen to the amusing voices of the
parrots; she did not take food; much less did she care about adorning
herself. And though her parents earnestly admonished her, she did not
recover her spirits. And she soon left her couch of lotus-fibres, and
wandered about like an insane woman, causing distress to her parents.
And when she would not listen to their words, though they tried to
console her, her parents in their anger pronounced this curse on her,
&ldquo;You shall fall for some time among the unfortunate race of the
Nish&aacute;das, with this very body of yours, without the power of
remembering your former birth.&rdquo; When thus cursed by her parents,
Makarandik&aacute; entered the house of a Nish&aacute;da, and became
that very moment a Nish&aacute;da maiden. And her father Sinhavikrama,
the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, repented, and through grief for her
died, and so did his wife. Now that king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas was
in a former birth a <i lang="sa-latn">&#7771;ishi</i> who knew all the
<i lang="sa-latn">&#347;&aacute;stras</i>, but now on account of some
remnant of former sin he has become this parrot, and his wife also has
been born as a wild sow, and this parrot, owing to the power of former
austerities, remembers what it learned in a former life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I laughed, considering the marvellous results of his
works. But he shall be released, as soon as he has told this tale in
the court of a king. And Somaprabha shall obtain the parrot&rsquo;s
daughter in his Vidy&aacute;dhara birth, Makarandik&aacute;, who has
now become a Nish&aacute;da female. And Manorathaprabh&aacute; also
shall obtain the hermit&rsquo;s son Ra&#347;mimat, who has now become a
king; but Somaprabha, as soon as he had seen his father, returned to
her hermitage, and remains there propitiating &#346;iva in order to
recover his beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit Pulastya had said thus much, he ceased, and I
remembered my birth, and was plunged in grief and joy. Then the hermit
Mar&iacute;chi, who carried me out of pity to the hermitage, took me
and reared me. And when my wings grew, I flew about hither and thither
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>flightiness natural to a bird,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2926src" href="#xd27e2926" name="xd27e2926src">5</a>
displaying the miracle of my learning. And falling into the hands of a
Nish&aacute;da, I have in course of time reached your court. And now my
evil works have spent their force, having been brought with me into the
body of a bird.</p>
<p>When the learned and eloquent parrot had finished this tale in the
presence of the court, king <span class="corr" id="xd27e2954" title=
"Source: S&uacute;manas">Sumanas</span> suddenly felt his soul filled
with astonishment, and disturbed with love. In the meanwhile &#346;iva,
being pleased, said to Somaprabha in a dream&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up,
king, and go into the presence of king Sumanas, there thou wilt find
thy beloved. For the maiden, named Makarandik&aacute;, has become, by
the curse of her father, a Nish&aacute;da maiden, named
Mukt&aacute;lat&aacute;, and she has gone with her own father, who has
become a parrot, to the court of the king. And when she sees thee, her
curse will come to an end, and she will remember her existence as a
Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden, and then a union will take place between you,
the joy of which will be increased by your recognizing one
another.&rdquo; Having said this to that king, &#346;iva, who is
merciful to all his worshippers, said to Manorathaprabh&aacute;, who
also was living in his hermitage, &ldquo;The hermit&rsquo;s son
Ra&#347;mimat, whom thou didst accept as thy bridegroom, has been born
again under the name of Sumanas, so go to him and obtain him, fair one;
he will at once remember his former birth, when he beholds thee.&rdquo;
So Somaprabha and the Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden, being separately
commanded in a dream by &#346;iva, went immediately to the court of
that Sumanas. And there Makarandik&aacute;, on beholding Somaprabha,
immediately remembered her former birth, and being released from her
long curse, and recovering her heavenly body, she embraced him. And
Somaprabha, having, by the favour of &#346;iva, obtained that daughter
of the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, as if she were the incarnate fortune
of heavenly enjoyment, embraced her, and considered himself to have
attained his object. And king Sumanas, having beheld
Manorathaprabh&aacute;, remembered his former birth, and entered his
former body, that fell from heaven, and became Ra&#347;mimat the son of
the chief of hermits. And once more united with his beloved, for whom
he had long yearned, he entered his own hermitage, and king Somaprabha
departed with his beloved to his own city. And the parrot too left the
body of a bird, and went to the home earned by his asceticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus you see that the appointed union of human beings
certainly takes place in this world, though vast spaces
intervene.&rdquo; When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this wonderful,
romantic, and agreeable story from his own minister Gomukha, as he was
longing for &#346;aktiya&#347;as, he was much pleased. <span class=

<p class="first">Then the chief minister Gomukha, having told the story

wife.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For the king Kuladhara once had a servant of
distinguished valour, a young man of good family, named
&#346;&uacute;ravarman. And one day, as he was returning from war, he
entered his house suddenly, and found his wife alone with his friend.
And when he saw it, he restrained his wrath, and in his self-control
reflected, &ldquo;What is the use of slaying this animal who has
betrayed his friend? Or of punishing this wicked woman? Why too should
I saddle my soul with a load of guilt?&rdquo; After he had thus
reflected, he left them both unharmed and said to them, &ldquo;I will
kill whichever of you two I see again. You must neither of you come in
my sight again. When he said this and let them depart, they went away
to some distant place, but &#346;&uacute;ravarman married another wife,
and lived there in comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, prince, a man who conquers wrath will not be subject to
grief; and a man, who displays prudence, is never harmed. Even in the
case of animals prudence produces success, not valour. In proof of it,
hear this story about the lion, and the bull, and other
animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">There was in a certain city a rich merchant&rsquo;s
son. Once on a time, as he was going to the city of Mathur&aacute; to
trade, a draught-bull belonging to him, named Sanj&iacute;vaka, as it
was dragging the yoke vigorously, broke it, and so slipped in the path,
which had become muddy by a mountain torrent flowing into it, and fell
and bruised its limbs. The merchant&rsquo;s son, seeing that the bull
was unable to move on account of its bruises, and not succeeding in his
attempts to raise it up from the ground, at last in despair went off
and left it there. And, as fate would have it, the bull slowly revived,
and rose up, and by eating tender grass recovered its former condition.
And it went to the bank of the Yamun&aacute;, and by eating green grass
and wandering about at will, it became fat and strong. And it roamed
about there, with full hump, wantoning, like the bull of &#346;iva,
tearing up ant-hills with its horns, and bellowing frequently.

<p>Now at that time there lived in a neighbouring wood a lion named
Pingalaka, who had subdued the forest by his might; and that king of
beasts had two jackals for ministers; the name of the one was Damanaka,
and the name of the other was Kara&#7789;aka. That lion, going one day
to the bank of the Yamun&aacute; to drink water, heard close to him the
roar of that bull Sanj&iacute;vaka. And when the lion heard the roar of
that bull, never heard before, resounding through the air, he thought,
&ldquo;What animal makes this sound? Surely some great creature dwells
here, so I will depart, for if it saw me, it might slay me, or expel me
from the forest.&rdquo; Thereupon the lion quickly returned to the
forest without drinking water, and continued in a state of fear, hiding
his feelings from his followers.</p>
<p>Then the wise jackal<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2991src" href=
"#xd27e2991" name="xd27e2991src">2</a> Damanaka, the minister of that

Kara&#7789;aka said&mdash;&ldquo;What business is this of ours? Have

<p class="first">In a certain town, a merchant had begun to build a
temple to a divinity, and had accumulated much timber. The workmen
there, after sawing through the upper half of a plank, placed a wedge
in it, and leaving it thus suspended, went home. In the meanwhile a
monkey came there and bounded up out of mischief, and sat on the plank,
the parts of which were separated by the wedge. And he sat in the gap
between the two parts, as if in the mouth of death, and in purposeless
mischief pulled out the wedge. Then he fell with the plank, the wedge
of which had been pulled out, and was killed, having his limbs crushed
by the flying together of the separated parts. <span class=

<p>&ldquo;Thus a person is ruined by meddling with what is not his own
business. So what is the use of our penetrating the mind of the king of
beasts?&rdquo; When the grave Damanaka heard Kara&#7789;aka say this,
he answered&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly wise ministers must penetrate and
observe the peculiarities of their master&rsquo;s character. For who
would confine his attention to filling his belly?&rdquo; When Damanaka
said this, the good Kara&#7789;aka said&mdash;&ldquo;Prying for
one&rsquo;s own gratification is not the duty of a servant.&rdquo;
Damanaka, being thus addressed, replied&mdash;&ldquo;Do not speak thus,
every one desires a recompense suited to his character; the dog is
satisfied with a bone only, the lion attacks an elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kara&#7789;aka heard this, he said, &ldquo;And supposing under
these circumstances the master is angry, instead of being pleased,
where is your special advantage? Lords, like mountains, are exceedingly
rough, firm, uneven, difficult of access, and surrounded with noxious
creatures.&rdquo; Then Damanaka said, &ldquo;This is true, but he who
is wise, gradually gets influence over his master by penetrating his
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kara&#7789;aka said&mdash;&ldquo;Well, do so,&rdquo; and
Damanaka went into the presence of his master the lion. The lion
received him kindly: so he bowed, and sat down, and immediately said to
him; &ldquo;King, I am a hereditary useful servant of yours. One useful
is to be sought after, though a stranger, but a mischievous one is to
be abandoned; a cat, being useful, is bought with money, brought from a
distance, and cherished; but a mouse, being harmful, is carefully
destroyed, though it has been nourished up in one&rsquo;s house. And a
king, who desires prosperity, must listen to servants who wish him
well, and they must give their lord at the right time useful counsel,
even without being asked. So, king, if you feel confidence in me, if
you are not angry, and if you do not wish to conceal your feelings from
me, and if you are not disturbed in mind by my boldness, I would ask
you a certain question.&rdquo; When Damanaka said this, the lion
Pingalaka answered; &ldquo;You are trustworthy, you are attached to me,
so speak without fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pingalaka said this, Damanaka said: &ldquo;King, being thirsty,
you went to drink water; so why did you return without drinking, like
one despondent?&rdquo; When the lion heard this speech of his, he
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I have been discovered by him, so why should I
try to hide the truth from this devoted servant?&rdquo; Having thus
reflected, he said to him, &ldquo;Listen, I must not hide anything from
you. When I went to drink water, I heard here a noise which I never
heard before, and I think, it is the terrible roar of some animal
superior to myself in strength. For, as a general rule, the might of
creatures is proportionate to the sound they utter, and it is well
known that the infinitely various animal creation has been made by God
in regular gradations. And now that he has entered here, I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>cannot
call my body nor my wood my own; so I must depart hence to some other
forest.&rdquo; When the lion said this, Damanaka answered him;
&ldquo;Being valiant, O king, why do you wish to leave the wood for so
slight a reason? Water breaks a bridge, secret whispering friendship,
counsel is ruined by garrulity, cowards only are routed by a mere
noise. There are many noises, such as those of machines, which are
terrible till one knows the real cause. So your Highness must not fear
this. Hear by way of illustration the story of the jackal and the
drum.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived a jackal in a certain forest
district. He was roaming about in search of food, and came upon a plot
of ground where a battle had taken place, and hearing from a certain
quarter a booming sound, he looked in that direction. There he saw a
drum lying on the ground, a thing with which he was not familiar. He
thought, &ldquo;What kind of animal is this, that makes such a
sound?&rdquo; Then he saw that it was motionless, and coming up and
looking at it, he came to the conclusion that it was not an animal. And
he perceived that the noise was produced by the parchment being struck
by the shaft of an arrow, which was moved by the wind. So the jackal
laid aside his fear, and he tore open the drum, and went inside, to see
if he could get anything to eat in it, but lo! it was nothing but wood
and parchment.</p>
<p>So, king, why do creatures like you fear a mere sound? If you
approve, I will go there to investigate the matter.&rdquo; When
Damanaka said this, the lion answered, &ldquo;Go there, by all means,
if you dare;&rdquo; so Damanaka went to the bank of the Yamun&aacute;.
While he was roaming slowly about there, guided by the sound, he
discovered that bull eating grass. So he went near him, and made
acquaintance with him, and came back, and told the lion the real state
of the ease. The lion Pingalaka was delighted and said, &ldquo;If you
have really seen that great ox, and made friends with him, bring him
here by some artifice, that I may see what he is like.&rdquo; So he
sent Damanaka back to that bull. Damanaka went to the bull and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Come! our master, the king of beasts is pleased to
summon you,&rdquo; but the bull would not consent to come, for he was
afraid. Then the jackal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>again returned to the forest, and
induced his master the lion to grant the bull assurance of protection.
And he went and encouraged Sanj&iacute;vaka with this promise of
protection, and so brought him into the presence of the lion. And when
the lion saw him come and bow before him, he treated him with
politeness, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Remain here now about my person, and
entertain no fear.&rdquo; And the bull consented, and gradually gained
such an influence over the lion, that he turned his back on his other
dependents, and was entirely governed by the bull.</p>
<p>Then Damanaka, being annoyed, said to Kara&#7789;aka in secret:
&ldquo;See! our master has been taken possession of by
Sanj&iacute;vaka, and does not trouble his head about us. He eats his
flesh alone, and never gives us a share. And the fool is now taught his
duty by this bull.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3043src" href=
"#xd27e3043" name="xd27e3043src">5</a> It was I that caused all this
mischief by bringing this bull. So I will now take steps to have him
killed, and to reclaim our master from his unbecoming
infatuation.&rdquo; When Kara&#7789;aka heard this from Damanaka, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;Friend, even you will not be able to do this
now.&rdquo; Then Damanaka said&mdash;&ldquo;I shall certainly be able
to accomplish it by prudence. What can he not do whose prudence does
not fail in calamity? As a proof, hear the story of the <i lang=

<p class="first">Of old time there dwelt a crane in a certain tank rich
in fish; and the fish in terror used to flee out of his sight. Then the
crane, not being able to catch the fish, told them a lying tale:
&ldquo;There has come here a man with a net who kills fish. He will
soon catch you with a net and kill you. So <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>act on
my advice, if you repose any confidence in me. There is in a lonely
place a translucent lake, it is unknown to the fishermen of these
parts; I will take you there one by one, and drop you into it, that you
may live there.&rdquo; When those foolish fish heard that, they said in
their fear&mdash;&ldquo;Do so, we all repose confidence in you.&rdquo;
Then the treacherous crane took the fish away one by one, and, putting
them down on a rock, devoured in this way many of them.</p>
<p>Then a certain <i lang="sa-latn">makara</i> dwelling in that lake,
seeing him carrying off fish, said:&mdash;&ldquo;Whither are you taking
the fish?&rdquo; Then that crane said to him exactly what he had said
to the fish. The <i>makara</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3083src"
href="#xd27e3083" name="xd27e3083src">8</a> being terrified,
said&mdash;&ldquo;Take me there too.&rdquo; The crane&rsquo;s intellect
was blinded with the smell of his flesh, so he took him up, and soaring
aloft carried him towards the slab of rock. But when the <i lang=
"sa-latn">makara</i> got near the rock, he saw the fragments of the
bones of the fish that the crane had eaten, and he perceived that the
crane was in the habit of devouring those who reposed confidence in
him. So no sooner was the sagacious <i lang="sa-latn">makara</i> put
down on the rock, than with complete presence of mind he cut off the
head of the crane. And he returned and told the occurrence, exactly as
it happened, to the other fish, and they were delighted, and hailed him
as their deliverer from death.</p>

<p class="first">There was in a certain forest a lion, who was
invincible, and sole champion of it, and whatever creature he saw in
it, he killed. Then all the animals, deer and all, met and deliberated
together, and they made the following petition to that king of
beasts&mdash;&ldquo;Why by killing us all at once do you ruin your own
interests? We will send you one animal every day for your
dinner.&rdquo; When the lion heard this, he consented to their
proposal, and as he was in the habit of eating one animal every day, it
happened that it was one day the lot of a hare to present himself to be
eaten. The hare was sent off by the united animals, but on the way the
wise creature reflected&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>&ldquo;He is truly brave who does not
become bewildered even in the time of calamity, so, now that Death
stares me in the face, I will devise an expedient.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting, the hare presented himself before the lion late. And when
he arrived after his time, the lion said to him: &ldquo;Hola! how is
this that you have neglected to arrive at my dinner hour, or what worse
penalty than death can I inflict on you, scoundrel?&rdquo; When the
lion said this, the hare bowed before him, and said: &ldquo;It is not
my fault, your Highness, I have not been my own master to-day, for
another lion detained me on the road, and only let me go after a long
interval.&rdquo; When the lion heard that, he lashed his tail, and his
eyes became red with anger, and he said: &ldquo;Who is that second
lion? Shew him me.&rdquo; The hare said: &ldquo;Let your Majesty come
and see him.&rdquo; The lion consented and followed him. Thereupon the
hare took him away to a distant well. &ldquo;Here he lives, behold
him,&rdquo; said the hare, and when thus addressed by the hare, the
lion looked into the well, roaring all the while with anger. And seeing
his own reflexion in the clear water, and hearing the echo of his own
roar, thinking that there was a rival lion there roaring louder than
himself,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3120src" href="#xd27e3120" name=
"xd27e3120src">10</a> he threw himself in a rage into the well, in
order to kill him, and there the fool was drowned. And the hare, having
himself escaped death by his wisdom, and having delivered all the
animals from it, went and delighted them by telling his adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that wisdom is the supreme power, not strength,
since by virtue of it even a hare killed a lion. So I will effect my
object by wisdom.&rdquo; When Damanaka said this, Kara&#7789;aka
remained silent.</p>
<p>Then Damanaka went and remained in the presence of the king
Pingalaka, in a state of assumed depression. And when Pingalaka asked
him the reason, he said to him in a confidential aside: &ldquo;I will
tell you, king, for if one knows anything, one ought not to conceal it.
And one should speak too without being commanded to do so, if one
desires the welfare of one&rsquo;s master. So hear this representation
of mine, and do not suspect me. This bull Sanj&iacute;vaka intends to
kill you and gain possession of the kingdom, for in his position of
minister he has come to the conclusion that you are timid; and longing
to slay you, he is brandishing his two horns, his natural weapons, and
he talks over the animals in the forest, encouraging them with speeches
of this kind&mdash;&lsquo;We will kill by some artifice this
flesh-eating king of beasts, and then you can live in security under
me, who am an eater of herbs only.&rsquo; So think about this bull; as
long as he is alive, there is no security for you.&rdquo; When Damanaka
said this, Pingalaka answered, &ldquo;What can that miserable
herb-eating bull do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>against me? But how can I kill a creature
that has sought my protection, and to whom I have promised immunity
from injury.&rdquo; When Damanaka heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Do
not speak so. When a king makes another equal to himself, Fortune does
not proceed as favourably as before.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3135src" href="#xd27e3135" name="xd27e3135src">11</a> The fickle
goddess, if she places her feet at the same time upon two exalted
persons, cannot keep her footing long, she will certainly abandon one
of the two. And a king, who hates a good servant and honours a bad
servant, is to be avoided by the wise, as a wicked patient by
physicians. Where there is a speaker and a hearer of that advice, which
in the beginning is disagreeable, but in the end is useful, there
Fortune sets her foot. He, who does not hear the advice of the good,
but listens to the advice of the bad, in a short time falls into
calamity, and is afflicted. So what is the meaning of this love of
yours for the bull, O king? And what does it matter that you gave him
protection, or that he came as a suppliant, if he plots against your
life? Moreover, if this bull remains always about your person, you will
have worms produced in you by his excretions. And they will enter your
body, which is covered with the scars of wounds from the tusks of
infuriated elephants. Why should he not have chosen to kill you by
craft? If a wicked person is wise enough not to do an injury<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the bed of a certain king there long lived
undiscovered a louse, that had crept in from somewhere or other, by
name Mandavisarpi&#7751;&iacute;. And suddenly a flea, named
Ti&#7789;&#7789;ibha, entered that bed, wafted there by the wind from
some place or other. And when Mandavisarpi&#7751;&iacute; saw him, she
said, &ldquo;Why have you invaded my home? go elsewhere.&rdquo;
Ti&#7789;&#7789;ibha answered, &ldquo;I wish to drink the blood of a
king, a luxury which I have never tasted before, so permit me to dwell
here.&rdquo; Then, to please him, the louse said to him, &ldquo;If this
is the case, remain. But you must not bite the king, my friend, at
unseasonable times, you must bite him gently when he is asleep.&rdquo;
When Ti&#7789;&#7789;ibha heard that, he consented and remained. But at
night he bit the king hard when he was in bed, and then the king rose
up, exclaiming, &ldquo;I am bitten,&rdquo; then the wicked flea fled
quickly, and the king&rsquo;s servants made a search in the bed, and
finding the louse there, killed it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mandavisarpi&#7751;&iacute; perished by associating with
Ti&#7789;&#7789;ibha. Accordingly your association with
Sanj&iacute;vaka will not be for your advantage; if you do not believe
in what I say, you will soon yourself see him approach, brandishing his
head, confiding in his horns, which are sharp as lances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By these words the feelings of Pingalaka were changed towards the
bull, and so Damanaka induced him to form in his heart the
determination that the bull must be killed. And Damanaka, having
ascertained the state of the lion&rsquo;s feelings, immediately went
off of his own accord to Sanj&iacute;vaka, and sat in his presence with
a despondent air. The bull said to him, &ldquo;Friend, why are you in
this state? Are you in good health?&rdquo; The jackal answered,
&ldquo;What can be healthy with a servant? Who is permanently dear to a
king? What petitioner is not despised? Who is not subject to
time?&rdquo; When the jackal said this, the bull again said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you seem so despondent to-day, my friend, tell
me?&rdquo; Then Damanaka said&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, I speak out of
friendship. The lion Pingalaka has to-day become hostile to you. So
unstable is his affection that, without regard for his friendship, he
wishes to kill you and eat you, and I see that his evilly-disposed
courtiers have instigated him to do it.&rdquo; The simple-minded bull,
supposing, on account of the confidence he had previously reposed in
the jackal, that this speech was true, and feeling despondent, said to
him: &ldquo;Alas a mean master, with mean retainers, though he be won
over by faithful service, becomes estranged; in proof of it hear this
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">There lived once in a certain forest a lion, named
Madotka&#7789;a, and he had three followers, a panther, a crow, and a
jackal. That lion once saw a camel, that had escaped from a caravan,
entering his wood, a creature he was not familiar with before, of
ridiculous appearance. That king of beasts said in astonishment,
&ldquo;What is this creature?&rdquo; And the crow, who knew when it
behoved him to speak,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3184src" href=
"#xd27e3184" name="xd27e3184src">15</a> said, &ldquo;It is a
camel.&rdquo; Then the lion, out of curiosity, had the camel summoned,
and giving him a promise of protection, he made him his courtier, and
placed him about his person.</p>
<p>One day the lion was wounded in a fight with an elephant, and being
out of health, made many fasts, though surrounded by those attendants
who were in good health. Then the lion, being exhausted, roamed about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>in search of food, but not finding any, secretly
asked all his courtiers, except the camel, what was to be done. They
said to him:&mdash;&ldquo;Your Highness, we must give advice which is
seasonable in our present calamity. What friendship can you have with a
camel, and why do you not eat him? He is a grass-eating animal, and
therefore meant to be devoured by us flesh-eaters. And why should not
one be sacrificed to supply food to many? If your Highness should
object, on the ground that you cannot slay one to whom you have granted
protection, we will contrive a plot by which we shall induce the camel
himself to offer you his own body.&rdquo; When they had said this, the
crow, by the permission of the lion, after arranging the plot, went and
said to that camel: &ldquo;This master of ours is overpowered with
hunger, and says nothing to us, so we intend to make him well-disposed
to us by offering him our bodies, and you had better do the same, in
order that he may be well-disposed towards you.&rdquo; When the crow
said this to the camel, the simple-minded camel agreed to it, and came
to the lion with the crow. Then the crow said, &ldquo;King, eat me, for
I am my own master.&rdquo; Then the lion said, &ldquo;What is the use
of eating such a small creature as you?&rdquo; Thereupon the jackal
said&mdash;&ldquo;Eat me,&rdquo; and the lion rejected him in the same
way. Then the panther said &ldquo;Eat me,&rdquo; and yet the lion would
not eat him; and at last the camel said &ldquo;Eat me.&rdquo; So the
lion, and the crow, and his fellows entrapped him by these deceitful
offers, and taking him at his word, killed him, divided him into
portions, and ate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same way some treacherous person has instigated
Pingalaka against me without cause. So now destiny must decide. For it
is better to be the servant of a vulture-king with swans for courtiers,
than to serve a swan as king, if his courtiers be vultures, much less a
king of a worse character, with such courtiers.<a class="noteref" id=

they wanted to go to another lake; so the tortoise said to them,
&ldquo;Take me also to the lake you are desirous of going to.&rdquo;
When the two swans heard this, they said to their friend the
tortoise&mdash;&ldquo;The lake to which we wish to go is a tremendous
distance off; but, if you wish to go there too, you must do what we
tell you. You must take in your teeth a stick held by us, and while
travelling through the air, you must remain perfectly silent, otherwise
you will fall and be killed.&rdquo; The tortoise agreed, and took the
stick in his teeth, and the two swans flew up into the air, holding the
two ends of it. And gradually the two swans, carrying the tortoise,
drew near that lake, and were seen by some men living in a town below;
and the thoughtless tortoise heard them making a chattering, while they
were discussing with one another, what the strange thing could be that
the swans were carrying. So the tortoise asked the swans what the
chattering below was about, and in so doing let go the stick from its
mouth, and falling down to the earth, was there killed by the men.</p>

<p class="first">Of old time there were three fish in a lake near a
river, one was called An&aacute;gatavidh&aacute;t&#7771;i, a second
Pratyutpannamati and the third Yadbhavishya,<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=

fishermen, who passed that way, saying to one another, &ldquo;Surely
there must be fish in this lake. Thereupon the prudent
An&aacute;gatavidh&aacute;t&#7771;i, fearing to be killed by the
fishermen, entered the current of the river and went to another place.
But Pratyutpannamati remained where he was, without fear, saying to
himself, &ldquo;I will take the expedient course if any danger should
arise.&rdquo; And Yadbhavishya remained there, saying to himself,
&ldquo;What must be, must be.&rdquo; Then those fishermen came and
threw a net into that lake. But the cunning Pratyutpannamati, the
moment he felt himself hauled up in the net, made himself rigid, and
remained as if he were dead. The fishermen, who were killing the fish,
did not kill him, thinking that he had died of himself, so he jumped
into the current of the river, and went off somewhere else, as fast as
he could. But Yadbhavishya, like a foolish fish, bounded and wriggled
in the net, so the fishermen laid hold of him and killed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I too will adopt an expedient when the time arrives; I
will not go away through fear of the sea.&rdquo; Having said this to
his wife, the <i lang="sa-latn">&#7789;i&#7789;&#7789;ibha</i> remained
where he was, in his nest; and there the sea heard his boastful speech.
Now, after some days, the hen-bird laid eggs, and the sea carried off
the eggs with his waves, out of curiosity, saying to himself; &ldquo;I
should like to know what this <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7789;i&#7789;&#7789;ibha</i> will do to me.&rdquo; And the
hen-bird, weeping, said to her husband; &ldquo;The very calamity which
I prophesied to you, has come upon us.&rdquo; Then that resolute
<i lang="sa-latn">&#7789;i&#7789;&#7789;ibha</i> said to his wife,
&ldquo;See, what I will do to that wicked sea!&rdquo; So he called
together all the birds, and mentioned the insult he had received, and
went with them and called on the lord Garu&#7693;a for protection. And
the birds said to him: &ldquo;Though thou art our protector, we have
been insulted by the sea as if we were unprotected, in that it has
carried away some of our eggs.&rdquo; Then Garu&#7693;a was angry, and
appealed to Vish&#7751;u, who dried up the sea with the weapon of fire,
and made it restore the eggs.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3298src" href=

<p>&ldquo;So you must be wise in calamity and not let go resolution.
But now a battle with Pingalaka is at hand for you. When he shall erect
his tail, and arise with his four feet together, then you may know that
he is about to strike you. And you must have your head ready tossed up,
and must gore him in the stomach, and lay your enemy low, with all his
entrails torn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Damanaka had said this to the bull Sanj&iacute;vaka, he went
to Kara&#7789;aka, and told him that he had succeeded in setting the
two at variance<span class="corr" title="Source: ,">.</span></p>
<p>Then Sanj&iacute;vaka slowly approached Pingalaka, being desirous of
finding out the mind of that king of beasts by his face and gestures.
And he saw that the lion was prepared to fight, being evenly balanced
on all four legs, and having erected his tail, and the lion saw that
the bull had tossed up his head in fear. Then the lion sprang on the
bull and struck him with his claws, the bull replied with his horns,
and so their fight went on. And the virtuous Kara&#7789;aka, seeing it,
said to Damanaka&mdash;&ldquo;Why have you brought calamity on our
master to gain your own ends? Wealth obtained by oppression of
subjects, friendship obtained by deceit, and a lady-love gained by
violence, will not remain long. But enough; whoever says much to a
person who despises good advice, incurs thereby misfortune, as

<p class="first">For instance, there were long ago in a certain village
two brothers, the sons of a merchant, Dharmabuddhi and
Dush&#7789;abuddhi by name. They left their father&rsquo;s house and
went to another country to get wealth, and with great difficulty
acquired two thousand gold <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>. And with them
they returned to their own city. And they buried those
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> at the foot of a tree, with the exception
of one hundred, which they divided between them in equal parts, and so
they lived in their father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But one day Dush&#7789;abuddhi went by himself and dug up of his own
accord those <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, which were buried at the foot
of the tree, for he was vicious and extravagant.<a class="noteref" id=

expenses.&rdquo; When Dharmabuddhi heard that, he consented, and went
and dug with him, where he had deposited the
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>. And when they did not find any
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> in the place where they had buried them,
the treacherous Dush&#7789;abuddhi said to Dharmabuddhi: &ldquo;You
have taken away the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, so give me my
half.&rdquo; But Dharmabuddhi answered: &ldquo;I have not taken them,
you must have taken them.&rdquo; So a quarrel arose, and
Dush&#7789;abuddhi hit Dharmabuddhi on the head with a stone, and
dragged him into the king&rsquo;s court. There they both stated their
case, and as the king&rsquo;s officers could not decide it, they were
proceeding to detain them both for the trial by ordeal. Then
Dush&#7789;abuddhi said to the king&rsquo;s officers; &ldquo;The tree,
at the foot of which these <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> were placed,
will depose, as a witness, that they were taken away by this
Dharmabuddhi. And they were exceedingly astonished, but said,
&ldquo;Well, we will ask it to-morrow.&rdquo; Then they let both
Dharmabuddhi and Dush&#7789;abuddhi go, after they had given bail, and
they went separately to their house.</p>
<p>But Dush&#7789;abuddhi told the whole matter to his father, and
secretly giving him money, said; &ldquo;Hide in the trunk of the tree
and be my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=

him and placed him at night in the capacious trunk of the tree, and
returned home. And in the morning those two brothers went with the
king&rsquo;s officers, and asked the tree, who took away those
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>. And their father, who was hidden in the
trunk of the tree, replied in a loud clear voice: &ldquo;Dharmabuddhi
took away the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s
officers heard this surprising utterance, they said; &ldquo;Surely
Dush&#7789;abuddhi must have hidden some one in the trunk.&rdquo; So
they introduced smoke into the trunk of the tree, which fumigated the
father of Dush&#7789;abuddhi so, that he fell out of the trunk on to
the ground, and died. When the king&rsquo;s officers saw this, they
understood the whole matter, and they compelled Dush&#7789;abuddhi to
give up the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> to Dharmabuddhi. And so they
cut off the hands and cut out the tongue of Dush&#7789;abuddhi, and
banished him, and they honoured Dharmabuddhi as a man who deserved his

<h3 class="main">Note to Chapter 60. The fables of Pilpay.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wilson in his collected works, (Vol. IV, p. 139)
remarks that we have in the Kath&aacute; Sarit S&aacute;gara an earlier
representative of the original collection of Indian fables, than even
the Panchatantra, as it agrees better with the Kalilah and Dimnah than
the Panchatantra does. The earliest Indian form of the Panchatantra
appears to have been translated into Pehlevi in the time of the king of
Persia, Khushru Naush&iacute;rv&aacute;ns (between 531 and 572 A. D.);
upon this the Arabic translation was based. It was edited by Silvestre
de Sacy under the title, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Calila et Dimna ou
Fables de Bidpai</span>,&rdquo; and has been translated into German by
Wolff, and into English by Knatchbull<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> There are many recensions of the Arabic
translation as of the Panchatantra. (Benfey is of opinion that
originally the latter work consisted of more than five sections.) The
oldest translation of the Arabic version is the Greek one by Symeon
Seth, which was made about 1080, A. D. (Benfey, <span lang=
"de">Einleitung</span>, p. 8, with note). The Latin translation of
Possinus was made from this. Perhaps the most important translation of
all is the Hebrew translation of Rabbi Joel. It must have been made
about 1250. It has never been edited, with the exception of a small
fragment, and is practically represented by the Latin translation of
John of Capua, made between 1263 and 1278. Benfey considers that the
first German translation was made from a MS. of this. The oldest German
translation has no date. The second appeared at Ulm in 1483. Another
version, probably not based upon any of these, is a poetical
paraphrase, the <span lang="de">Alter Aesopus</span> of Baldo, edited
by Ed&eacute;l&eacute;stand du M&eacute;ril in his <span lang=
"fr">Po&eacute;sies in&eacute;dites du Moyen Age</span>. There is a
Spanish translation from the Arabic, perhaps through an unknown Latin
version, which appeared about 1251. A portion has been published by
Rodriguez De Castro. Possibly Raimond&rsquo;s Latin translation was
based partly on this, and partly on the Latin translation of the Hebrew
by John of Capua.</p>
<p>The Arabic version was translated into Persian by Nasr Allah in the
12th century. Upon it is based the <span class="corr" id="xd27e3526"
title="Source: Anv&aacute;r-i-Sohaili">Anv&aacute;r-i-Suhaili</span> of
Husain Vaiz, which was written three centuries later. It has been
translated into English by Eastwick. (Hertford 1854). (The above note
is summarized from Benfey&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Einleitung</span>).
See also Rhys Davids&rsquo; Buddhist Birth Stories, Introduction, pp.
xciii and xciv. He says that the Arabic version was made from the

supposes that the Indians borrowed all the fables representing the
jackal as a wise animal, as he is not particularly cunning. He thinks
that they took the Western stories about the fox, and substituted for
that animal the jackal. Benfey argues that this does not prove that
these fables are not of Indian origin. German stories represent the
lion as king of beasts, though it is not a German animal.

Sacy&rsquo;s edition of the Arabic version, and in the old Greek

The judges set the tree on fire (or apply smoke to it,) not
Dharmabuddhi, (as in Panchatantra, Benfey, Vol. II, pp. 114 &amp;

is hanged, in De Sacy&rsquo;s Arabic and the old Greek version both
remain alive, in Somadeva, and John of Capua, and the
Anv&aacute;r-i-Suhaili, the father dies and the son is punished. Here
we have a fresh proof that the Hebrew version, from which John of Capua
translated, is the truest representative of the oldest Arabic
recension. (Benfey&rsquo;s Panchatantra, Vol. I, p. 275 and <i>ff.</i>)

that Somadeva must have rejected it though it was in his copy. Benfey

some rice, and then hid himself.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king of the pigeons, named Chitragr&iacute;va,
as he was roaming through the air, attended by hundreds of pigeons,
came there, and seeing the grains of rice scattered on the ground, he
alighted on the net out of desire for food, and got caught in the
meshes with all his attendants. When Chitragr&iacute;va saw that, he
said to all his followers; &ldquo;Take the net in your beaks, and fly
up into the air as fast as you can.&rdquo; All the terrified pigeons
said,&mdash;&ldquo;So be it&rdquo;&mdash;and taking the net, they flew
up swiftly, and began to travel through the air. The fowler too rose
up, and with eye fixed upwards, returned despondent. Then
Chitragr&iacute;va, being relieved from his fear, said to his
followers; &ldquo;Let us quickly go to my friend the mouse
Hira&#7751;ya, he will gnaw these meshes asunder and set us at
liberty.&rdquo; With these words he went on with those pigeons, who
were dragging the net along with them, and descended from the air at
the entrance of a mouse&rsquo;s hole. And there the king of the pigeons
called the mouse, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Hira&#7751;ya, come out, I,
Chitragr&iacute;va, have arrived.&rdquo; And when the mouse heard
through the entrance, and saw that his friend had come, he came out
from that hole with a hundred openings. The mouse went up to him, and
when he had heard what had taken place, proceeded with the utmost
eagerness to gnaw asunder the meshes, that kept the pigeon-king and his
retinue prisoners. And when he had gnawed the meshes asunder,
Chitragr&iacute;va took leave of him with kind words, and flew up into
the air with his companions.</p>
<p>And when the crow, who had followed the pigeons, saw that, he came
to the entrance of the hole, and said to the mouse who had re-entered
it; &ldquo;I am Laghup&aacute;tin, a crow; seeing that you tender your
friends dearly, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>choose you for my friend, as you are a
creature capable of delivering from such calamities.&rdquo; When the
mouse saw that crow from the inside of his hole, he said,
&ldquo;Depart! what friendship can there be between the eater and his
prey?&rdquo; Then the crow said,&mdash;&ldquo;God forbid! If I were to
eat you, my hunger might be satisfied for a moment, but if I make you
my friend, my life will be always preserved by you.&rdquo; When the
crow had said this, and more, and had taken an oath, and so inspired
confidence in the mouse, the mouse came out, and the crow made friends
with him. The mouse brought out pieces of flesh and grains of rice, and
there they both remained eating together in great happiness.</p>
<p>And one day the crow said to his friend the mouse: &ldquo;At a
considerable distance from this place there is a river in the middle of
a forest, and in it there lives a tortoise named Mantharaka, who is a
friend of mine; for his sake I will go to that place where flesh and
other food is easily obtained; it is difficult for me to obtain
sustenance here, and I am in continual dread of the fowler.&rdquo; When
the crow said this to him, the mouse answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Then we
will live together, take me there also; for I too have an annoyance
here, and when we get there, I will explain the whole matter to
you.&rdquo; When Hira&#7751;ya said this, Laghup&aacute;tin took him in
his beak, and flew to the bank of that forest stream. And there he
found his friend, the tortoise Mantharaka, who welcomed him, and he and
the mouse sat with him. And after they had conversed a little, that
crow told the tortoise the cause of his coming, together with the
circumstance of his having made friends with Hira&#7751;ya. Then the
tortoise adopted the mouse, as his friend on an equal footing with the
crow, and asked the cause of the annoyance which drove him from his
native place. Then Hira&#7751;ya gave this account of his experiences
in the hearing of the crow and the tortoise.</p>

the Br&aacute;hman said this, his wife consented, and placed some
sesame-seeds in the sun. And while she went into the house, a dog
tasted them and defiled them, so nobody would buy that dish of
sesame-seeds and rice<span class="corr" title=

<p>&ldquo;So, you see, covetousness does not give pleasure, it only
causes annoyance to those who cherish it.&rdquo; When the hermit, who
was a visitor, had said this, he went on to say; &ldquo;If you have a
spade, give it me, in order that I may take steps to put a stop to this
annoyance caused by the mouse.&rdquo; Thereupon the hermit, to whom the
cell belonged, gave the visitor a spade, and I, who saw it all from my
place of concealment, entered my hole. Then the cunning hermit, who had
come to visit the other, discovering the hole by which I entered, began
to dig. And while I retired further and further in, he went on digging,
until at last he reached the necklace and the rest of my stores. And he
said to the hermit, who resided there, in my hearing, &ldquo;It was by
the power of this necklace that the mouse had such strength.&rdquo; So
they took away all my wealth and placed the necklace on their necks,
and then the master of the cell and the visitor went to sleep with
light hearts. But when they were asleep, I came again to steal, and the
resident hermit woke up and hit me with a stick on the head. That
wounded me, but, as it chanced, did not kill me, and I returned to my
hole. But after that, I had never strength to make the bound necessary
for stealing the food. For wealth is youth to creatures, and the want
of it produces old age; owing to the want of it, spirit, might, beauty,
and enterprise fail. So all my retinue of mice, seeing that I had
become intent on feeding myself only, left me. Servants leave a master
who does not support them, bees a tree without flowers, swans a tank
without water, in spite of long association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have been long in a state of despondency, but now,
having obtained this Laghup&aacute;tin for a friend, I have come here
to visit you, noble tortoise.&rdquo; When Hira&#7751;ya had said this,
the tortoise Manthara answered&mdash;&ldquo;This is a home to you; so
do not be despondent, my friend. To a virtuous man no country is
foreign; a man who is content cannot be unhappy; for the man of
endurance calamity does not exist; there is nothing impossible to the
enterprising.&rdquo; While the tortoise was saying this, a deer, named
Chitr&aacute;nga, came to that wood from a great distance, having been
terrified by the hunters. When they saw him, and observed that no
hunter was pursuing him, the tortoise and his companions made friends
with him, and he recovered his strength and spirits. And those four,
the crow, the tortoise, the mouse, and the deer, long lived there
happily as friends, engaged in reciprocal courtesies. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day Chitr&aacute;nga was behind time, and Laghup&aacute;tin flew
to the top of a tree to look for him, and surveyed the whole wood. And
he saw Chitr&aacute;nga on the bank of the river, entangled in the
fatal noose, and then he came down and told this to the mouse and the
tortoise. Then they deliberated together, and Laghup&aacute;tin took up
the mouse in his beak, and carried him to Chitr&aacute;nga. And the
mouse Hira&#7751;ya comforted the deer, who was distressed at being
caught, and in a moment set him at liberty by gnawing his bonds
asunder.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3809src" href="#xd27e3809" name=
"xd27e3809src">20</a> In the meanwhile the tortoise Manthara, who was
devoted to his friends, came up the bank near them, having travelled
along the bed of the river. At that very moment the hunter, who had set
the noose, arrived from somewhere or other, and when the deer and the
others escaped, caught and made prize of the tortoise. And he put it in
a net, and went off, grieved at having lost the deer. In the meanwhile
the friends saw what had taken place, and by the advice of the
far-seeing mouse, the deer went a considerable distance off, and fell
down as if he were dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3812src" href=
"#xd27e3812" name="xd27e3812src">21</a> And the crow stood upon his
head, and pretended to peck his eyes. When the hunter saw that, he
imagined that he had captured the deer, as it was dead, and he began to
make for it, after putting down the tortoise on the bank of the river.
When the mouse saw him making towards the deer, he came up, and gnawed
a hole in the net which held the tortoise, so the tortoise was set at
liberty, and he plunged into the river. And when the deer saw the
hunter coming near, without the tortoise, he got up, and ran off, and
the crow, for his part, flew up a tree. Then the hunter came back, and
finding that the tortoise had escaped by the net&rsquo;s having been
gnawed asunder, he returned home, lamenting that the tortoise had fled
and could not be recovered.</p>
<p>Then the four friends came together again in high spirits, and the
gratified deer addressed the three others as follows; &ldquo;I am
fortunate in having obtained you for friends, for you have to-day
delivered me from death at the risk of your lives.&rdquo; In such words
the deer praised the crow and the tortoise and the mouse, and they all
lived together delighting in their mutual friendship.</p>
<p>Thus, you see, even animals attain their ends by wisdom, and they
risk their lives sooner than abandon their friends in calamity. So full
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=

<p class="first">There lived once on a time in a certain town a jealous
husband, who had for wife a beautiful woman, whom he loved exceedingly.
But being suspicious he never left her alone, for he feared that she
might be seduced even by men in pictures. However, one day he had to go
to another country on unavoidable business, and he took his wife with
him. And seeing that a forest inhabited by Bhillas lay in his way, he
left his wife in the house of an old Br&aacute;hman villager, and
proceeded on his journey. But, while she was there, she saw some
Bhillas, who had come that way, and she eloped with a young Bhilla whom
she saw. And she went with him to his village,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3858src" href="#xd27e3858" name="xd27e3858src">23</a> following
her inclinations, having escaped from her jealous husband, as a river
that has broken a dam.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile her husband finished his business, and returned,
and asked the Br&aacute;hman villager for his wife, and the
Br&aacute;hman answered him, &ldquo;I do not know where she has gone;
so much only I know, that some Bhillas came here: she must have been
carried off by them. And their village is near here, go there quickly,
you will find your wife there, without doubt.&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman told him this, he wept, and blamed his own folly, and
went to that village of Bhillas, and there he saw his wife. When the
wicked woman saw him, she approached him in fear and said, &ldquo;It is
not my fault, the Bhilla brought me here by force.&rdquo; Her husband,
blind with love, said, &ldquo;Come along, let us return home, before
any one discovers us.&rdquo; But she said to him, &ldquo;Now is the
time when the Bhilla returns from hunting; when he returns he will
certainly pursue you and me, and kill us both. So enter this cavern at
present, and remain concealed. But at night we will kill him when he is
asleep, and leave this place in perfect safety.&rdquo; When the wicked
woman said this to him, he entered the cave; what room is there for
discernment in the heart of one blinded with love?</p>
<p>The Bhilla returned at the close of the day, and that wicked woman
shewed him her husband in the cave, whom his passion had enabled her to
decoy there. And the Bhilla, who was a strong man, and cruel, dragged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>out the husband, and tied him firmly to a tree, in
order that he might next day offer him to Bhav&aacute;n&iacute;.</p>
<p>And he ate his dinner, and at night lay down to sleep by the side of
the faithless wife, before the eyes of the husband. Then that jealous
husband, who was tied to the tree, seeing him asleep, implored
Bhav&aacute;n&iacute; to help him in his need, praising her with hymns.
She appeared and granted him a boon, so that he escaped from his bonds,
and cut off the head of the Bhilla with his own sword. Then he woke up
his wife, and said to her: &ldquo;Come, I have killed this
villain,&rdquo; and she rose up much grieved. And the faithless woman
set out at night with her husband, but she secretly took with her the
head of the Bhilla. And the next morning, when they reached a town, she
shewed the head, and laying hands upon her husband, cried out,
&ldquo;This man has killed my husband.&rdquo; Then the city police took
her with her husband before the king. And the jealous husband, being
questioned, told the whole story. Then the king enquired into it, and
finding that it was true, he ordered the ears and nose of that
faithless wife to be cut off, and set her husband at liberty. And he
went home freed from the demon of love for a wicked woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, prince, is how a woman behaves when over-jealously
watched, for the jealousy of the husband teaches the wife to run after
other men. So a wise man should guard his wife without shewing
jealousy. And a man must by no means reveal a secret to a woman, if he
desires prosperity. Hear a story shewing this.&rdquo;</p>

And he, being a fool, was ashamed because, though a rich man in the

came to him and said, &ldquo;There is a physician who knows a drug that
will produce hair.&rdquo; When he heard it, he said;&mdash;&ldquo;If
you bring him to me, I will give wealth to you and to that physician

And after the doctor too had long lived at his expense, he one day
removed his head-dress designedly, and shewed him his bald head. In
spite of that, the blockhead, without considering, asked him for a drug
which would produce hair, then the physician said to
him,&mdash;&ldquo;Since I am bald myself, how can I produce hair in
others? It was in order to explain this to you, that I showed you my
bald head. But out on you! you do not understand even now.&rdquo; With

he, whenever he came to his house, had eaten and drunk abroad. And one

you splendidly, but V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu only gave you a welcome. So
why do you think more highly of V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu than of the

agreed, and went to Kaly&aacute;&#7751;avarman and told him that
falsehood, and he answered: &ldquo;Lady, I am a merchant&rsquo;s son,

<h3 class="main">Story of the astrologer who killed his son.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a certain astrologer wanting in discernment.
He left his own country with his wife and son, because he could not
earn a subsistence, and went to another country. There he made a
deceitful display of his skill, in order to gain complimentary presents
by a factitious reputation for ability. He embraced his son before the
public and shed tears. When the people asked him why he did this, the
wicked man said: &ldquo;I know the past, the present, and the future,
and that enables me to foresee that this child of mine will die in
seven days from this time: this is why I am weeping.&rdquo; By these
words he excited the wonder of the people, and when the seventh day
arrived, he killed his son in the morning, as he lay asleep. When the
people saw that his son was dead, they felt confidence in his skill,
and honoured him with presents, and so he acquired wealth and returned
leisurely to his own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus foolish men, through desire of wealth, go so far as to
kill their sons, in order to make a false display of prescience; the
wise should not make friends with such. Now hear the story of the
foolish man who was addicted to anger.&rdquo;</p>

house, the good qualities of a man, who was listening outside. Then a
person present said: &ldquo;It is true, my friend, that he possesses
many good qualities, but he has two faults; he is violent and
irascible.&rdquo; While he was saying this, the man, who was outside,
overhearing him, entered hastily, and twisted his garment round his
throat, and said: &ldquo;You fool, what violence have I done, what
anger have I been guilty of?&rdquo; This he said in an abusive way,
inflamed with the fire of anger. Then the others who were there
laughed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=

account of his great affection for her, he wished to make her grow, so
he quickly summoned physicians, and said politely to them: &ldquo;Make
some preparation of salutary drugs, in order that my daughter may grow
up quickly, and be married to a good husband.&rdquo; When the
physicians heard this, they said, in order to get a living out of the
silly king: &ldquo;There is a medicine which will do this, but it can
only be procured in a distant country, and while we are sending for it,
we must shut up your daughter in concealment, for this is the treatment
laid down for such cases.&rdquo; When they had said this, they placed
his daughter in concealment there for many years, saying that they were
engaged in bringing that medicine. And when she grew up to be a young
woman, they shewed her to that king, telling him that she had been made
to grow by the medicine; and he was pleased, and loaded them with heaps
of wealth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were two Br&aacute;hmans, brothers, in the city
of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra; the elder was called Yajnasoma and the
younger K&iacute;rtisoma. And those two young Br&aacute;hmans had much
wealth derived from their father. K&iacute;rtisoma increased his share
by business, but Yajnasoma exhausted his by enjoying and giving. Then,
being reduced to poverty, he said to his wife; &ldquo;My dear, how can
I, who am reduced from riches to poverty, live among my relations? Let
us go to some foreign country.&rdquo; She said,&mdash;&ldquo;How can we
go without money for the journey.&rdquo; Still her husband insisted, so
she said to him: &ldquo;If you really must go, then first go and ask
your younger brother K&iacute;rtisoma for some money for the
journey.&rdquo; So he went and asked his younger brother for his
travelling expenses, but his younger brother&rsquo;s wife said to him:
&ldquo;How can we give even the smallest sum to this man who has wasted
his substance. For every one who falls into poverty will sponge on
us.&rdquo; When K&iacute;rtisoma heard this, he no longer felt inclined
to give anything to his elder brother, though he loved him. Subjection
to bad women is pernicious!</p>
<p>Then Yajnasoma went away silent, and told that to his wife, and set
out with her, relying upon the help of Heaven only. When they reached
the wood, it happened that, as he was going along, he was swallowed by
a monstrous serpent. And when his wife saw it, she fell on the ground
and lamented. And the serpent said with a human voice to the lady:
&ldquo;Why do you lament, my good woman?&rdquo; The Br&aacute;hman lady
answered the snake: &ldquo;How can I help lamenting, mighty sir, when
you have deprived me in this remote spot of my only means of obtaining
alms?&rdquo; When the serpent heard that, he brought out of his mouth a
great vessel of gold and gave it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>her, saying, &ldquo;Take this as
a vessel in which to receive alms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

Br&aacute;hman lady said, &ldquo;Who will give me alms in this vessel,
for I am a woman?&rdquo; The serpent said: &ldquo;If any one refuses to
give you alms in it, his head shall that moment burst into a hundred
pieces. What I say is true.&rdquo; When the virtuous Br&aacute;hman
lady heard that, she said to the serpent, &ldquo;If this is so, then
give me my husband in it by way of alms.&rdquo; The moment the good
lady said this, the serpent brought her husband out of his mouth alive
and unharmed. As soon as the serpent had done this, he became a man of
heavenly appearance, and being pleased, he said to the joyful couple:
&ldquo;I am a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
K&aacute;nchanavega, and by the curse of Gautama I was reduced to the
condition of a serpent. And it was appointed that my curse should end
when I conversed with a good woman.&rdquo; When the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas had said this, he immediately filled the vessel with
jewels, and delighted flew up into the sky. And the couple returned
home with abundance of jewels. And there Yajnasoma lived in happiness
having obtained inexhaustible wealth.</p>

with a rug. When the donkey saw him going away in this style, he
thought he was another donkey, and being primed with corn, he uttered
aloud his own asinine bray. Then the cultivator came to the conclusion
that it was a donkey, and returning, killed with an arrow the foolish

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a great lake abounding in water, called
Chandrasaras. And on its bank there lived a king of the hares, named
&#346;il&iacute;mukha. Now, once on a time, a leader of a herd of
elephants, named Chaturdanta, came there to drink water, because all
the other reservoirs of water were dried up in the drought that
prevailed. Then many of the hares, who were the subjects of that king,
were trampled to death by Chaturdanta&rsquo;s herd, while entering the
lake. When that monarch of the herd had departed, the hare-king
&#346;il&iacute;mukha, being grieved, said to a hare named Vijaya in
the presence of the others; &ldquo;Now that that lord of elephants has
tasted the water of this lake, he will come here again and again, and
utterly destroy us all, so think of some expedient in this case. Go to
him, and see if you have any artifice which will suit the purpose or
not. For you know business and expedients, and are an ingenious orator.
And in all cases in which you have been engaged the result has been
fortunate.&rdquo; When despatched with these words, the hare was
pleased, and went slowly on his way. And following up the track of the
herd, he overtook that elephant-king and saw him, and being determined
somehow or other to have an interview with the mighty beast, the wise
hare climbed up to the top of a rock, and said to the elephant;
&ldquo;I am the ambassador of the moon, and this is what the god says
to you by my mouth; &lsquo;I dwell in a cool lake named
Chandrasaras;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4256src" href="#xd27e4256"

hare-marked;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4261src" href="#xd27e4261"
name="xd27e4261src">7</a> now thou hast defiled that lake and slain
those hares of mine. If thou do that again, thou shalt receive thy due
recompense from me.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the king of elephants
heard this speech of the crafty hare&rsquo;s, he said in his terror;
&ldquo;I will never do so again: I must shew respect to the awful
moon-god.&rdquo; The hare said,&mdash;&ldquo;So come, my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>friend,
I pray, and we will shew him to you.&rdquo; After saying this, the hare
led the king of elephants to the lake, and shewed him the reflection of
the moon in the water. When the lord of the herd saw that, he bowed
before it timidly at a distance, oppressed with awe, and never came
there again. And &#346;il&iacute;mukha, the king of the hares, was
present, and witnessed the whole transaction, and after honouring that
hare, who went as an ambassador, he lived there in security.</p>
<p>When the crow had told this story, he went on to say to the birds,
&ldquo;This is the right sort of king, whose name alone ensures none of
his subjects being injured. So why does this base owl, who cannot see
in the day, deserve a throne? And a base creature is never to be
trusted, hear this tale in proof of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Once on a time I lived in a certain tree, and below me
in the same tree a bird, named Kapinjala, had made a nest and lived.
One day he went away somewhere, and he did not return for many days. In
the meanwhile a hare came and took possession of his nest. After some
days Kapinjala returned, and an altercation arose between him and the
hare, as both laid claim to the nest, exclaiming; &ldquo;It is mine,
not yours.&rdquo; Then they both set out in search of a qualified
arbitrator. And I, out of curiosity, followed them unobserved, to see
what would turn up. After they had gone a little way they saw on the
bank of a lake a cat, who pretended to have taken a vow of abstinence
from injury to all creatures, with his eyes half-closed in meditation.
They said to one another; &ldquo;Why should we not ask this holy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>cat here to declare what is
just?&rdquo;&mdash;Then they approached the cat and said;
&ldquo;Reverend sir, hear our cause, for you are a holy ascetic.&rdquo;
When the cat heard that, he said to them in a low voice,&mdash;&ldquo;I
am weak from self-mortification, so I cannot hear at a distance, pray,
come near me. For a case wrongly decided brings temporal and eternal
death.&rdquo; With these words the cat encouraged them to come just in
front of him, and then the base creature killed at one spring both the
hare and Kapinjala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, one cannot confide in villains whose actions are
base. Accordingly you must not make this owl king, for he is a great
villain.&rdquo; When the crow said this to the birds, they admitted the
force of it, and gave up the idea of anointing the owl king, and
dispersed in all directions. And the owl said to the crow;
&ldquo;Remember; from this day forth you and I are enemies. Now I take
my leave of you.&rdquo; And he went away in a rage. But the crow,
though he thought that he had spoken what was right, was for a moment
despondent. Who is not grieved when he has involved himself in a
dangerous quarrel by a mere speech?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that our feud with the owls arose from an
inconsiderate utterance.&rdquo; Having said this to the king,
Chiraj&iacute;vin continued, &ldquo;The owls are numerous and strong,
and you cannot conquer them. Numbers prevail in this world, hear an
instance.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Br&aacute;hman had bought a goat, and was returning
from a village with it on his shoulder, when he was seen on the way by
many rogues, who wished to deprive him of the goat. And one of them
came up to him, and pretending to be in a great state of excitement,
said; &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, how come you to have this dog on your
shoulder? Put it down.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he
paid no attention to it, but went on his way. Then two more came up and
said the very same thing to him. Then he began to doubt, and went along
examining the goat carefully, when three other rascals came up to him
and said: &ldquo;How comes it that you carry a dog and a sacrificial
thread at the same time? Surely you must be a hunter, not a
Br&aacute;hman, and this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>is the dog with the help of which you
kill game.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he said:
&ldquo;Surely some demon has smitten my sight and bewildered me. Can
all these men be under the influence of an optical delusion?&rdquo;
Thereupon the Br&aacute;hman flung down the goat, and after bathing,
returned home, and the rogues took the goat and made a satisfactory
meal off it.</p>
<p>After Chiraj&iacute;vin had told this tale, he said to the king of
the crows: &ldquo;So you see, king, numerous and powerful foes are hard
to conquer. So you had better adopt, in this war with powerful foes,
the following expedient, which I suggest. Pluck out some of my
feathers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4349src" href="#xd27e4349" name=

there, until I return, having accomplished my object. The king of the
crows agreed, and plucked out some of his feathers, as if in anger, and
placed him under the tree, and went off to the mountain with his
followers: and Chiraj&iacute;vin remained lying flat under the tree
which was his home.</p>
<p>Then the king of the owls, Avamarda, came there at night with his
followers, and he did not see a single crow on the tree. At that moment
Chiraj&iacute;vin uttered a feeble caw below, and the king of the owls,
hearing it, came down, and saw him lying there. In his astonishment he
asked him who he was, and why he was in that state. And
Chiraj&iacute;vin answered, pretending that his voice was weak from
pain; &ldquo;I am Chiraj&iacute;vin, the minister of that king of the
crows. And he wished to make an attack on you in accordance with the
advice of his ministers. Then I rebuked those other ministers, and said
to him, &lsquo;If you ask me for advice, and if I am valued by you, in
that case you will not make war with the powerful king of the owls. But
you will endeavour to propitiate him, if you have any regard for
policy.&rsquo; When the foolish king of the crows heard that, he
exclaimed, &lsquo;This fellow is a partisan of my enemies,&rsquo; and
in his wrath, he and his followers pecked me, and reduced me to this
state. And he flung me down under the tree, and went off somewhere or
other with his followers.&rdquo; When Chiraj&iacute;vin had said this,
he sighed, and turned his face to the ground. And then the king of the
owls asked his ministers what they ought to do with Chiraj&iacute;vin.
When his minister D&iacute;ptanayana heard this, he said, &ldquo;Good
people spare even a thief, though ordinarily he ought not to be spared,
if they find that he is a benefactor.&rdquo;</p>

as a donation. A thief happened to see them, and began plotting how to
carry them off. At that very time a R&aacute;kshasa was longing to eat
that Br&aacute;hman. It happened that the thief and the
R&aacute;kshasa, as they were going to his house at night to accomplish
their objects, met, and telling one another their errands, went
together. When the thief and the R&aacute;kshasa entered the
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s dwelling, they began to wrangle. The thief said;
&ldquo;I will carry off the oxen first, for if you lay hold of the
Br&aacute;hman first, and he wakes up, how can I get the yoke of

While this was going on, the Br&aacute;hman woke up. Then he took his

<p class="first">For once on a time there was a carpenter, who had a
wife whom he loved dearly; and the carpenter heard from his neighbours
that she was in love with another man; so, wishing to test the fidelity
of his wife, he said to her one day: &ldquo;My dear, I am by command of
the king going a long journey to-day, in order to do a job, so give me
barley-meal and other things as provision for the journey.<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> She obeyed and gave him
provisions, and he went out of the house; and then secretly came back
into it, and with a pupil of his hid himself under the bed. As for the
wife, she summoned her paramour. And while she was sitting with him on
the bed, the wicked woman happened to touch her husband with her foot,
and found out that he was there. And a moment after, her paramour,
being puzzled, asked her which she loved the best, himself or her
husband. When she heard this, the artful and treacherous woman said to
that lover of hers; &ldquo;I love my husband best, for his sake I would
surrender my life. As for this unfaithfulness of mine, it is natural to
women; they would even eat dirt, if they had no noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the carpenter heard this hypocritical speech of the adulteress,
he came out from under the bed, and said to his pupil; &ldquo;You have
seen, you are my witness to this; though my wife has betaken herself to
this lover, she is still so devoted to me; so I will carry her on my
head.&rdquo; When the silly fellow had said this, he immediately took
them both up, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=

of his pupil, and carried them about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So an undiscerning blockhead, though he sees a crime
committed before his eyes, is satisfied with hypocritical flattery, and
makes himself ridiculous. So you must not spare Chiraj&iacute;vin, who
is a follower of your enemy, for, if not carefully watched, he might
slay your Majesty in a moment, like a disease.&rdquo; When the king of
the owls heard Rakt&aacute;ksha say this, he answered; &ldquo;It was in
trying to benefit us that the worthy creature was reduced to this
state. So how can we do otherwise than spare his life? Besides, what
harm can he do us unaided?&rdquo; So the king of the owls rejected the
advice of Rakt&aacute;ksha, and comforted that crow Chiraj&iacute;vin.
Then Chiraj&iacute;vin said to the king of the owls, &ldquo;What is the
use to me of life, now that I am in this state? So have logs of wood
brought me, in order that I may enter the fire. And I will ask the fire
as a boon, that I may be born again as an owl, in order that I may
wreak my vengeance upon this king of the crows.&rdquo; When he said
this, Rakt&aacute;ksha laughed and said to him; &ldquo;By the favour of
our master you will be well enough off: what need is there of fire?
Moreover you will never become an owl, as long as you have the nature
of a crow. Every creature is such as he is made by the
Creator.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For once on a time a hermit found a young mouse, which
had escaped from the claws of a kite, and pitying it, made it by the
might of his asceticism into a young maiden. And he brought her up in
his hermitage; and, when he saw that she had grown up, wishing to give
her to a powerful husband, he summoned the sun. And he said to the sun;
&ldquo;Marry this maiden, whom I wish to give in marriage to some
mighty one.&rdquo; Then the sun answered, &ldquo;The cloud is more
powerful than I, he obscures me in a moment.&rdquo; When the hermit
heard that, he dismissed the sun, and summoned the cloud, and made the
same proposal to him. He replied, &ldquo;The wind is more powerful than
I: he drives me into any quarter of the heaven he pleases.&rdquo; When
the hermit got this answer, he summoned the wind and made the same
proposal to him. And the wind replied, &ldquo;The mountains are
stronger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

great hermit heard this, he summoned the Him&aacute;laya, and made the
same proposal to him. That mountain answered him; &ldquo;The mice are
stronger than I am, for they dig holes in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus got these answers in succession from those wise
divinities, the great <i lang="sa-latn">&#7771;ishi</i> summoned a
forest mouse, and said to him, &ldquo;Marry this maiden.&rdquo;
Thereupon the mouse said, &ldquo;Shew me how she is to be got into my
hole.&rdquo; Then the hermit said, &ldquo;It is better that she should
return to her condition as a mouse.&rdquo; So he made her a mouse
again, and gave her to that male mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So a creature returns to what it was, at the end of a long
peregrination, accordingly you, Chiraj&iacute;vin, will never become an
owl.&rdquo; When Rakt&aacute;ksha said this to Chiraj&iacute;vin, the
latter reflected; &ldquo;This king has not acted on the advice of this
minister, who is skilled in policy. All these others are fools, so my
object is gained.&rdquo; While he was thus reflecting, the king of the
owls took Chiraj&iacute;vin with him to his own fortress, confiding in
his own strength, disregarding the advice of Rakt&aacute;ksha. And
Chiraj&iacute;vin, being about his person, and fed with pieces of meat
and other delicacies by him, soon acquired as splendid a plumage as a
peacock.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4454src" href="#xd27e4454" name=

this night and slay him, and that I may make<a class="noteref" id=

for this favour of yours. But do you all fortify your door with grass
and other things, and remain in the cave where your nests are, that
they may not attack you by day.&rdquo; When, by saying this,
Chiraj&iacute;vin had made the owls retire into their cave, and
barricade the door and the approaches to the cave, with grass and
leaves, he went back to his own king. And with him he returned,
carrying a brand from a pyre, all ablaze, in his beak, and every one of
the crows that followed him had a piece of wood hanging down from his
beak. And the moment he arrived, he set on fire the door of the cave,
in which were those owls, creatures that are blind by day, which had
been barricaded with dry grass and other stuff.</p>
<p>And every crow, in the same way, threw down at the same time his
piece of wood, and so kindled a fire and burnt the owls, king

his enemies with the help of Chiraj&iacute;vin, was highly delighted,
and returned with his tribe of crows to his own banyan-tree. Then
Chiraj&iacute;vin told the story of how he lived among his enemies, to
king Meghavar&#7751;a, the king of the crows, and said to him;
&ldquo;Your enemy, king, had one good minister named Rakt&aacute;ksha;
it is because he was infatuated by confidence, and did not act on that
minister&rsquo;s advice, that I was allowed to remain uninjured.
Because the villain did not act on his advice, thinking it was
groundless, I was able to gain the confidence of the impolitic fool,
and to deceive him. It was by a feigned semblance of submission that
the snake entrapped and killed the frogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">A certain old snake, being unable to catch frogs
easily on the bank of a lake, which was frequented by men, remained
there motionless. And when he was there, the frogs asked him, keeping
at a safe distance; &ldquo;Tell us, worthy sir, why do you no longer
eat frogs as of old?&rdquo; When the snake was asked this question by
the frogs, he answered, &ldquo;While I was pursuing a frog, I one day
bit a Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son in the finger by mistake, and he died.
And his father by a curse made me a bearer of frogs. So how can I eat
you now? On the contrary I will carry you on my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king of the frogs heard that, he was desirous of being
carried<span class="corr" id="xd27e4507" title="Source: .">,</span> and
putting aside fear, he came out of the water, and joyfully mounted on
the back of the snake. Then the snake, having gained his good-will by
carrying him about with his ministers, represented himself as
exhausted, and said cunningly; &ldquo;I cannot go a step further
without food, so give me something to eat. How can a servant exist
without subsistence?&rdquo; When the frog-king, who was fond of being
carried about, heard this, he said to him; &ldquo;Eat a few of my
followers then.&rdquo; So the snake ate all the frogs in succession, as
he pleased, and the king of the frogs put up with it, being blinded
with pride at being carried about by the snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus a fool is deceived by a wise man who worms himself into
his confidence. And in the same way I ingratiated myself with your
enemies and brought about their ruin. So a king must be skilled in
policy and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=

servants and slain by his foes at will. And this goddess of prosperity,
O king, is ever treacherous as gambling, fickle as a wave, intoxicating
as wine. But she remains as persistently constant to a king, who is
self-contained, well-advised, free from vice, and knows differences of
character, as if she were tied with a rope. So you must now remain
attentive to the words of the wise, and glad at the slaughter of your
enemies, rule a realm free from opponents.&rdquo; When the minister
Chiraj&iacute;vin said this to the crow-king Meghavar&#7751;a, the
latter loaded him with honours, and ruled as he recommended.</p>
<p>When Gomukha had said this, he went on to say to the son of the king
of Vatsa; &ldquo;So you see, king, that even animals are able to rule
prosperously by means of discretion, but the indiscreet are always
ruined and become the laughing-stock of the public.&rdquo;</p>

complained to the king, and he had the villagers, who had eaten the
buffalo, brought before him. And the proprietor of the buffalo said
before the king, in their presence; &ldquo;These foolish men took my
buffalo under a banyan-tree near the tank, and killed it and ate it
before my eyes.&rdquo; Whereupon an old fool among the villagers said,
&ldquo;There is no tank or banyan-tree in our village. He says what is
not true: where did we kill his buffalo or eat it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the proprietor of the buffalo heard this, he said; &ldquo;What!
is there not a banyan-tree and a tank on the east side of the village?
Moreover, you ate my buffalo on the eighth day of the lunar
month.&rdquo; When the proprietor of the buffalo said this, the old
fool replied, &ldquo;There is no east side or eighth day in our
village.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he laughed, and said, to
encourage the fool; &ldquo;You are a truthful person, you never say
anything false, so tell me the truth, did you eat that buffalo or did
you not?&rdquo; When the fool heard that, he said, &ldquo;I was born
three years after my father died, and he taught me skill in speaking.
So I never say what is untrue, my sovereign; it is true that we ate his
buffalo, but all the rest that he alleges is false.&rdquo; When the
king heard this, he and his courtiers could not restrain their
laughter; so the king restored the price of the buffalo to the
plaintiff, and fined those villagers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, fools, in the conceit of their folly, while they deny
what need not be denied, reveal what it is their interest to suppress,
in order to get themselves believed.<span class="corr" title=

invited to a feast. So if you do not bring me a garland of blue lotuses
from somewhere or other, you will cease to be my husband, and I shall

him, and cried out; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am a

he was brought before the king, and when questioned, he uttered in his

questioned him persistently, and when he told his story, being a

Benfey&rsquo;s Panchatantra, IIIrd book, page 213, Vol. II. Benfey
points out that in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, Dro&#7751;a&rsquo;s
son, one of the few Kauravas that had survived the battle, was lying
under a sacred fig-tree, on which crows were sleeping. Then he sees one
owl come and kill many of the crows. This suggests to him the idea of
attacking the camp of the P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;avas. In the Arabic
text the hostile birds are ravens and owls. So in the Greek and the
Hebrew translation. John of Capua has &ldquo;sturni,&rdquo;
misunderstanding the Hebrew. (Benfey, Vol. I, 335). Rhys Davids states
in his Buddhist Birth Stories (p. 292 note,) that the story of the
lasting feud between the crows and the owls is told at length in

remarks that this fable was known to Plato; Cratylus, 411, A, (but the
passage might refer to some story of Bacchus personating Hercules, as
in the Ran&aelig;,) and he concludes that the fable came from Greece to
India. He compares &AElig;sop, (Furia, 141, Coraes, 113,) Lucianus,

the river, to die, by the rats and mice, and there eats them. The
second moment is the folly of litigiousness: here he compares a passage
in Dubois&rsquo;s Panchatantra. The third is the object of contention,
the nest, for which he compares Ph&aelig;drus, I, 21. (Benfey, Vol. I,
pp. 350&ndash;354). I should compare, for the 1st moment,
Ph&aelig;drus, Lib. II, Fabula, IV, (recognovit Lucianus Mueller)

<p class="first">The next morning Narav&aacute;hanadatta woke up, and
thinking on his beloved &#346;aktiya&#347;as, became distracted. And
thinking that the rest of the month, until he married her, was as long
as an age, he could not find pleasure in anything, as his mind was
longing for a new wife. When the king, his father, heard that from the
mouth of Gomukha, out of love for him, he sent him his ministers, and
Vasantaka was among them. Then, out of respect for them, the prince of
Vatsa managed to recover his composure. And the discreet minister
Gomukha said to Vasantaka; &ldquo;Noble Vasantaka, tell some new and
romantic tale to delight the mind of the crown-prince. Then the wise

<h3 class="main">Story of Ya&#347;odhara and Lakshm&iacute;dhara and
the two wives of the water-genius.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a famous Br&aacute;hman in M&aacute;lava,
named &#346;r&iacute;dhara. And twin sons, of like feature, were born
to him. The eldest was named Ya&#347;odhara, and his younger brother
was Lakshm&iacute;dhara. And when they grew up, the two brothers set
out together for a foreign country to study, with the approval of their
father. And as they were travelling along, they reached a great
wilderness, without water, without the shade of trees, full of burning
sand; and being fatigued with passing through it, and exhausted with
heat and thirst, they reached in the evening a shady tree laden with
fruit. And they saw, at a little distance from its foot, a lake with
cold and clear water, perfumed with the fragrance of lotuses. They
bathed in it, and refreshed themselves with drinking the cold water,
and sitting down on a slab of rock, rested for a time. And when the sun
set, they said their evening prayers, and through fear of wild beasts
they climbed up the tree, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=
"#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>to spend the night there. And in the
beginning of the night, many men rose out of the water of that tank
below them, before their eyes. And one of them swept the ground,
another painted it, and another strewed on it flowers of five colours.
And another brought a golden couch and placed it there, and another
spread on it a mattress with a coverlet. Another brought, and placed in
a certain spot, under the tree, delicious food and drink, flowers and
unguents. Then there arose from the surface of that lake a man wearing
a sword, and adorned with heavenly ornaments, surpassing in beauty the
god of Love.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4672src" href="#xd27e4672"
name="xd27e4672src">1</a> When he had sat down on the couch, his
attendants threw garlands round his neck, and anointed him with
unguents, and then they all plunged again into the lake. Then he
brought out of his mouth a lady of noble form and modest appearance,
wearing auspicious garlands and ornaments, and a second, rich in
celestial beauty, resplendent with magnificent robes and
ornaments<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4679src" href="#xd27e4679" name="xd27e4679src">2</a>
These were both his wives, but the second was the favourite. Then the
first and good wife placed jewelled plates on the table, and handed
food in two plates to her husband and her rival. When they had eaten,
she also ate; and then her husband reclined on the couch with the rival
wife, and went to sleep. And the first wife shampooed his feet, and the
second remained awake on the couch.</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s sons who were in the tree, saw this,
they said to one another, &ldquo;Who can this be? Let us go down and
ask the lady who is shampooing his feet, for all these are immortal
beings.&rdquo; Then they got down and approached the first wife, and
then the second saw Ya&#347;odhara: then she rose up from the couch in
her inordinate passion, while her husband was asleep, and approaching
that handsome youth, said, &ldquo;Be my lover.&rdquo; He answered,
&ldquo;Wicked woman, you are to me the wife of another, and I am to you
a strange man. Then why do you speak thus?&rdquo; She answered,
&ldquo;I have had a hundred lovers. Why are you afraid? If you do not
believe it, look at these hundred rings,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4684src" href="#xd27e4684" name="xd27e4684src">3</a> for I have
taken one ring from each of them.&rdquo; With these words she took the
rings out of the corner of her garment, and shewed them to him. Then
Ya&#347;odhara said, &ldquo;I do not care whether you have a hundred or
a hundred thousand lovers, to me you are as a mother; I am not a person
of that sort.&rdquo; When the wicked woman was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>repelled
by him in this way, she woke up her husband in her wrath, and, pointing
to Ya&#347;odhara, said with tears, &ldquo;This scoundrel, while you
were asleep, used violence to me.&rdquo; When her husband heard this,
he rose up and drew his sword. Then the first and virtuous wife
embraced his feet, and said, &ldquo;Do not commit a crime on false
evidence. Hear what I have to say. This wicked woman, when she saw him,
rose up from your side, and eagerly importuned him, and the virtuous
man did not consent to her proposal.&rdquo; When he repelled her,
saying, &lsquo;You are to me as a mother,&rsquo; being unable to endure
that, in her anger she woke you up, to make you kill him. And she has
already before my eyes had a hundred lovers here on various nights,
travellers who were reposing in this tree, and taken their rings from
them. But I never told you, not wishing to give rise to unpleasantness.
However, to-day I am necessarily compelled to reveal this secret, lest
you should be guilty of a crime. Just look at the rings in the corner
of her garment, if you do not believe it. And my wifely virtue is of
such a kind that I cannot tell my husband what is untrue. In order that
you may be convinced of my faithfulness, see this proof of my
power.&rdquo; After saying this, she reduced that tree to ashes with an
angry look, and restored it more magnificent than it was before with a
look of kindness. When her husband saw that, he was at last satisfied
and embraced her. And he sent that second wife, the adulteress, about
her business, after cutting off her nose, and taking the rings from the
corner of her garment.</p>
<p>He restrained his anger, when he beheld that student of the
scripture, Ya&#347;odhara, with his brother, and he said to him
despondingly; &ldquo;Out of jealousy I always keep these wives of mine
in my heart. But still I have not been able to keep safe this wicked
woman. Who can arrest the lightning? Who can guard a disloyal woman? As
for a chaste woman, she is guarded by her own modesty alone, and being
guarded by it, she guards<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4694src" href=
"#xd27e4694" name="xd27e4694src">4</a> her husband in both worlds, as I
have to-day been guarded by this woman, whose patience is more
admirable even than her power of cursing. By her kindness I have got
rid of an unfaithful wife, and avoided the awful crime of killing a
virtuous Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo; When he had said this, he made
Ya&#347;odhara sit down, and said to him, &ldquo;Tell me whence you
come and whither you are going.&rdquo; Then Ya&#347;odhara told him his
history, and having gained his confidence, said to him out of
curiosity, &ldquo;Noble sir, if it is not a secret, tell me now, who
you are, and why, though you possess such luxury, you dwell in the
water.&rdquo; When the man who lived in the water heard this, he said,
&ldquo;Hear! I will tell you.&rdquo; And he began to tell his history
in the following words. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=

<h3 class="main">Story of the water-genius in his previous birth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a region in the south of the Him&aacute;laya,
called Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra; which Providence seems to have created in
order to prevent mortals from hankering after Heaven; where &#346;iva
and Vish&#7751;u, as self-existent deities, inhabit a hundred shrines,
forgetting their happy homes in Kail&aacute;sa and
&#346;vetadv&iacute;pa; which is laved by the waters of the
Vitast&aacute;, and full of heroes and sages, and proof against
treacherous crimes and enemies, though powerful. There I was born in my
former life, as an ordinary villager of the Br&aacute;hman caste, with
two wives, and my name was Bhava&#347;arman. There I once struck up a
friendship with some Buddhist mendicants, and undertook the vow, called
the fast <i lang="sa-latn">Uposha&#7751;a</i>, prescribed in their
scriptures. And when this vow was almost completed, one of my wives
wickedly came and slept in my bed. And in the fourth watch of the
night, bewildered with sleep, I broke my vow. But as it fell only a
little short of completion, I have been born as a water-genius, and
these two wives of mine have been born as my present wives here. That
wicked woman was born as that unfaithful wife, the second as this
faithful one. So great was the power of my vow, though it was rendered
imperfect, that I remember my former birth, and enjoy such luxuries
every night. If I had not rendered my vow imperfect, I should never
have been born as what I am.</p>
<p>When he had told his story in these words, he honoured those two
brothers as guests, with delicious food and heavenly garments. Then his
faithful wife, having heard of her former life, knelt on the ground,
and looking at the moon, uttered this prayer, &ldquo;O guardians of the
world, if I am in truth virtuous and devoted to my husband, may this
husband of mine be at once delivered from the necessity of dwelling in
the water and go to heaven.&rdquo; The moment she had said this, a
chariot descended from heaven, and the husband and wife ascended it and
went to heaven. Nothing in the three worlds is unattainable by really
chaste women. And the two Br&aacute;hmans, when they saw that, were
greatly astonished. And Ya&#347;odhara and Lakshm&iacute;dhara, after
spending the rest of the night there, set out in the morning. And in
the evening they reached the foot of a tree in a lonely wilderness. And
while they were longing to get water, they heard this voice from the
tree, &ldquo;Wait a little, Br&aacute;hmans! I will entertain you
to-day with a bath and food, for you are come to my house.&rdquo; Then
the voice ceased, and there sprang up there a tank of water, and meats
and drinks of every kind were provided on its bank. The two
Br&aacute;hman youths said with astonishment to one
another,&mdash;&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; And after bathing in
the tank, they ate and drank. Then they said the evening prayer and
remained under the tree, and in the meanwhile a handsome man appeared
from it. They saluted him, and he welcomed them, and he sat down.
Thereupon the two Br&aacute;hman youths asked him who he was. Then the
man said&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman who became a Yaksha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago I was a Br&aacute;hman in distress, and when
I was in this condition, I happened to make friends with some Buddhist
ascetics. But while I was performing the vow called <i lang=
"sa-latn">Uposha&#7751;a</i>, which they had taught me, a wicked man
made me take food in the evening by force. That made my vow incomplete,
so I was born as a Guhyaka; if I had only completed it, I should have
been born as a god in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have told you my story, but now do you two tell me, who
you are, and why you have come to this desert.&rdquo; When
Ya&#347;odhara heard this, he told him their story. Thereupon the
Yaksha went on to say; &ldquo;If this is the case, I will by my own
power bestow on you the sciences. Go home with a knowledge of them.
What is the use of roaming about in foreign countries?&rdquo; When he
had said this, he bestowed on them the sciences, and by his power they
immediately possessed them. Then the Yaksha said to them, &ldquo;Now I
entreat you to give me a fee as your instructor. You must perform, on
my behalf, this <i lang="sa-latn">Uposha&#7751;a</i> vow, which
involves the speaking of the truth, the observing of strict chastity,
the circumambulating the images of the gods with the right side turned
towards them, the eating only at the time when Buddhist mendicants do,
restraint of the mind, and patience. You must perform this for one
night, and bestow the fruit of it on me, in order that I may obtain
that divinity, which is the proper fruit of my vow, when completely
performed.&rdquo; When the Yaksha said this, they bowed before him and
granted his request, and he disappeared in that very same tree.</p>
<p>And the two brothers, delighted at having accomplished their object
without any toil, after they had passed the night, returned to their
own home. There they told their adventures and delighted their parents,
and performed that vow of fasting for the benefit of the Yaksha. Then
that Yaksha, who taught them, appeared in a sky-chariot, and said to
them; &ldquo;Through your kindness I have ceased to be a Yaksha and
have become a god. So now you must perform this vow for your own
advantage, in order that at your death you may attain divinity. And in
the meanwhile I give you a boon, by which you will have inexhaustible
wealth.&rdquo; When the deity, who roamed about at will, had said this,
he went to heaven in his chariot. Then the two brothers, Ya&#347;odhara
and Lakshm&iacute;dhara, lived happily, having performed that vow, and
having obtained wealth and knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that, if men are addicted to righteousness, and do
not, even in emergencies, desert their principles, even the gods
protect them and cause them to attain their objects.&rdquo;
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, while longing for his beloved
&#346;aktiya&#347;as, was much delighted with this marvellous story
told by Vasantaka; but having been summoned by his father at the dinner
hour, he went to his palace with his ministers. There he took the
requisite refreshment, and returned to his palace, with Gomukha
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=

amuse him, again said,&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, prince, I will tell you
another string of tales.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in a forest of <i lang=
"sa-latn">u&#7693;umbaras</i>, on the shore of the sea, a king of
monkeys, named Val&iacute;mukha, who had strayed from his troop. While
he was eating an <i lang="sa-latn">u&#7693;umbara</i> fruit, it fell
from his hand and was devoured by a porpoise that lived in the water of
the sea. The porpoise, delighted at the taste of the fruit, uttered a
melodious sound, which pleased the monkey so much, that he threw him
many more fruits. And so the monkey went on throwing fruits,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4751src" href="#xd27e4751" name="xd27e4751src">6</a>
and the porpoise went on making a melodious sound, until a friendship
sprang up between them. So every day the porpoise spent the day in the
water near the monkey, who remained on the bank, and in the evening he
went home.</p>
<p>Then the wife of the porpoise came to learn the facts, and as she
did not approve of the friendship between the monkey and her husband,
which caused the latter to be absent all day, she pretended to be ill.
Then the porpoise was afflicted, and asked his wife again and again
what was the nature of her sickness, and what would cure it. Though he
importuned her persistently, she would give no answer, but at last a
female confidante of hers said to him: &ldquo;Although you will not do
it, and she does not wish you to do it, still I must speak. How can a
wise person conceal sorrow from friends? A violent disease has seized
your wife, of such a kind that it cannot be cured without soup made of
the lotus-like heart of a monkey.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4762src" href="#xd27e4762" name="xd27e4762src">7</a> When the
porpoise heard this from his wife&rsquo;s confidante, he
reflected;&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! how shall I obtain the lotus-like heart
of a monkey? Is it right for me to plot treachery against the monkey,
who is my friend? On the other hand how else can I cure my wife, whom I
love more than my life?&rdquo; When the porpoise had thus reflected, he
said to his wife; &ldquo;I will bring you a whole monkey, my dear, do
not be unhappy.&rdquo; When he had said this, he went to his friend the
monkey, and said to him, after he had got <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>into conversation;
&ldquo;Up to this day you have never seen my home and my wife; so come,
let us go and rest there one day. Friendship is but hollow, when
friends do not go without ceremony and eat at one another&rsquo;s
houses, and introduce their wives to one another.&rdquo; With these
words the porpoise beguiled the monkey, and induced him to come down
into the water, and took him on his back and set out. And as he was
going along, the monkey saw that he was troubled and confused, and
said, &ldquo;My friend, you seem to be altered to-day.&rdquo; And when
he went on persistently enquiring the reason, the stupid porpoise,
thinking that the ape was in his power, said to him; &ldquo;The fact
is, my wife is ill, and she has been asking me for the heart of a
monkey to be used as a remedy; that is why I am in low spirits
to-day.&rdquo; When the wise monkey heard this speech of his, he
reflected, &ldquo;Ah! This is why the villain has brought me here!
Alas! this fellow is overpowered by infatuation for a female, and is
ready to plot treachery against his friend. Will not a person possessed
by a demon eat his own flesh with his teeth?&rdquo; After the monkey
had thus reflected, he said to the porpoise; &ldquo;If this is the
case, why did you not inform me of this before, my friend? I will go
and get my heart for your wife. For I have at present left it on the
<i lang="sa-latn">u&#7693;umbara</i>-tree on which I live.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4779src" href="#xd27e4779" name="xd27e4779src">8</a>
When the silly porpoise heard this, he was sorry and he said;
<span class="corr" id="xd27e4782" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Then bring it, my friend, from the
<i lang="sa-latn">u&#7693;umbara</i>-tree.&rdquo; And thereupon the
porpoise took him back to the shore of the sea. When he got there, he
bounded up the bank, as if he had just escaped from the grasp of death,
and climbing up to the top of the tree, said to that porpoise,
&ldquo;Off with you, you fool! Does any animal keep his heart outside
his body? However, by this artifice I have saved my life, and I will
not return to you. Have you not heard, my friend, the story of the
ass?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in a certain forest a lion, who had a
jackal for a minister. A certain king, who had gone to hunt, once found
him, and wounded him so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>sorely with his weapons, that he with
difficulty escaped to his den alive. When the king was gone, the lion
still remained in the den, and his minister, the jackal, who lived on
his leavings, being exhausted for want of food, said to him; &ldquo;My
lord, why do you not go out and seek for food to the best of your
ability, for your own body is being famished as well as your
attendants?&rdquo; When the jackal said this to the lion, he answered;
&ldquo;My friend, I am exhausted with wounds, and I cannot roam about
outside my den. If I could get the heart and ears of a donkey to eat,
my wounds would heal, and I should recover my former health. So go and
bring me a donkey quickly from somewhere or other.&rdquo; The jackal
agreed to do so and sallied out. As he was wandering about, he found a
washerman&rsquo;s ass in a solitary place, and he went up to him, and
said in a friendly way; &ldquo;Why are you so exhausted?&rdquo; The
donkey answered, &ldquo;I am reduced by perpetually carrying this
washerman&rsquo;s load.&rdquo; The jackal said, &ldquo;Why do you
endure all this toil? Come with me and I will take you to a forest as
delightful as Heaven, where you may grow fat in the society of
she-asses.&rdquo; When the donkey, who was longing for enjoyment, heard
this, he went to the forest, in which that lion ranged, in the company
of that jackal. And when the lion saw him, being weak from impaired
vitality, he only gave him a blow with his paw behind, and the donkey,
being wounded by the blow, was terrified and fled immediately, and did
not come near the lion again, and the lion fell down confused and
bewildered. And then the lion, not having accomplished his object,
hastily returned to his den. Then the jackal, his minister, said to him
reproachfully; &ldquo;My lord, if you could not kill this miserable
donkey, what chance is there of your killing deer and other
animals?&rdquo; Then the lion said to him, &ldquo;If you know how,
bring that donkey again. I will be ready and kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lion had despatched the jackal with these words, he went to
the donkey and said; &ldquo;Why did you run away, sir? And the donkey
answered, &ldquo;I received a blow from some creature.&rdquo; Then the
jackal laughed and said, &ldquo;You must have experienced a delusion.
There is no such creature there, for I, weak as I am, dwell there, in
safety. So come along with me to that forest, where pleasure is without
restraint.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4874src" href="#xd27e4874"
name="xd27e4874src">10</a> When he said this, the donkey was deluded,
and returned to the forest. And as soon as the lion saw him, he came
out of his den, and springing on him from behind, tore him with his
claws and killed him. And the lion, after he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>divided
the donkey, placed the jackal to guard it, and being fatigued, went
away to bathe. And in the meanwhile the deceitful jackal devoured the
heart and ears of that donkey, to gratify his appetite. The lion, after
bathing, came back, and perceiving the donkey in this condition, asked
the jackal where its ears and heart were. The jackal answered him;
&ldquo;The creature never possessed ears or a heart,&mdash;otherwise
how could he have returned when he had once escaped?&rdquo; When the
lion heard that, he believed it, and ate his flesh, and the jackal
devoured what remained over.</p>
<p>When the ape had told this tale, he said again to the porpoise;
&ldquo;I will not come again, why should I behave like the
jackass.&rdquo; When the porpoise heard this from the monkey, he
returned home, grieving that he had through his folly failed to execute
his wife&rsquo;s commission, while he had lost a friend. But his wife
recovered her former tranquillity, on account of the termination of her
husband&rsquo;s friendship with the ape. And the ape lived happily on
the shore of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So a wise person should place no confidence in a wicked
person. How can he, who confides in a wicked person or a black cobra,
enjoy prosperity?&rdquo; When Gomukha had told this story, he again
said to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, to amuse him; &ldquo;Now hear in
succession about the following ridiculous fools. Hear first about the
fool who rewarded the minstrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">A certain musician once gave great pleasure to a rich
man, by singing and playing before him. He thereupon called his
treasurer, and said in the hearing of the musician, &ldquo;Give this
man two thousand <i lang="sa-latn">pa&#7751;as</i>.&rdquo; The
treasurer said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and went out. Then the
minstrel went and asked him for those <i lang=

with his master, refused to give them.</p>
<p>Then the musician came and asked the rich man for the <i lang=

that I should make you a return? You gave a short-lived pleasure to my
ears by playing on the lyre, and I gave a short-lived pleasure to your
ears by promising you money.&rdquo; When the musician heard that, he
despaired of his payment, laughed, and went home.</p>

<p class="first">A certain teacher had two pupils who were jealous of
one another. And one of those pupils washed and anointed every day the
right foot of his instructor, and the other did the same to the left
foot. Now it happened that one day the pupil, whose business it was to
anoint the right foot, had been sent to the village, so the teacher
said to the second pupil, whose business it was to anoint the left
foot,&mdash;&ldquo;To-day you must wash and anoint my right foot
also.&rdquo; When the foolish pupil received this order, he coolly said
to his teacher; &ldquo;I cannot anoint this foot that belongs to my
rival.&rdquo; When he said this, the teacher insisted. Then that pupil,
who was the very opposite of a good pupil, took hold of his
teacher&rsquo;s foot in a passion, and exerting great force, broke it.
Then the teacher uttered a cry of pain, and the other pupils came in
and beat that wicked pupil, but he was rescued from them by that
teacher, who felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>The next day, the other pupil came back from the village, and when
he saw the injury that had been done to his teacher&rsquo;s foot, he
asked the history of it, and then he was inflamed with rage, and he
said, &ldquo;Why should I not break the foot that belongs to that enemy
of mine?&rdquo; So he laid hold of the teacher&rsquo;s second leg, and
broke it. Then the others began to beat that wicked pupil, but the
teacher, both of whose legs were broken, in compassion begged him off
too. Then those two pupils departed, laughed to scorn by the whole
country, but their teacher, who deserved so much credit for his patient
temper, gradually got well.</p>
<p>Thus foolish attendants, by quarrelling with one another, ruin their
master&rsquo;s interests, and do not reap any advantage for themselves.

blind, the head, that was in the usual place, was furnished with eyes.
And there was a quarrel between them, each saying that it was the
principal head. Now the serpent usually roamed about with his real head
foremost. But once on a time the head in the tail caught hold of a
piece of wood, and fastening firmly round it, prevented that snake from
going on. The consequence was that the snake considered this head very
powerful, as it had vanquished the head in front. And so the snake
roamed about with his blind head foremost, and in a hole he fell into
fire, owing to his not being able to see the way, and so he was

does not seem to have been aware of the existence of this story in

to be founded on Babrius, 95. There the fox only eats the heart. Indeed
there is no point in the remark that if he had <i>ears</i> he would not
have come again. The animal is a stag in Babrius. It is deceived by an
appeal to its ambition. In the Gesta Romanorum the animal is a boar,
which returns to the garden of Trajan, after losing successively its
two ears and tail. (Benfey&rsquo;s Panchatantra, Vol. I, p. 430 and
<i>ff.</i>) See also Weber&rsquo;s article in <span lang="de">Indische

Benfey, Vol. I, p. 537. It has a certain resemblance to the fable of
Menenius. There is a snake in Bengal with a knob at the end of his
tail. Probably this gave rise to the legend of the double-headed
serpent. Sir Thomas Browne devotes to the Amphisb&aelig;na Chapter XV
of the third book of his Vulgar Errors, and craves leave to

Yajnadatt&aacute;. And she became pregnant, and in time gave birth to a
son, and the Br&aacute;hman, though poor, thought he had obtained a
treasure in him. And when she had given birth to the child, the
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s wife went to the river to bathe, but
Deva&#347;arman remained in the house, taking care of his infant son.
In the meanwhile a maid came from the womens&rsquo; apartments of the
palace to summon that Br&aacute;hman, who lived on presents received
for performing inauguratory ceremonies. Then he, eager for a fee, went
off to the palace, leaving a mungoose, which he had brought up from its
birth, to guard his child. After he had gone, a snake suddenly came
near the child, and the mungoose, seeing it, killed it out of love for
his master. Then the mungoose saw Deva&#347;arman returning at a
distance, and delighted, ran out to meet him, all stained with the
blood of the snake. And Deva&#347;arman, when he saw its appearance,
felt certain that it had killed his young child, and, in his agitation
killed it with a stone. But when he went into the house, and saw the
snake killed by the mungoose, and his boy alive, he repented of what he
had done. And when his wife returned and heard what had happened, she
reproached him, saying, &ldquo;Why did you inconsiderately kill the
mungoose, which had done you a good turn<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e5056" title="Source: .">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore a wise man, prince, should never do anything
rashly. For a person who acts rashly is destroyed in both worlds. And
one who does anything contrary to the prescribed method, obtains a
result which is the opposite of that desired.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">For instance, there was a man suffering from
flatulence. And once on a time the doctor gave him a medicine, to be
used as a clyster, and said to him, &ldquo;Go to your house, and bruise
this, and wait till I come.&rdquo; The physician, after giving this
order, delayed a little, and in the meanwhile the fool, having reduced
the drug to powder, mixed it with water and drank it. That made him
very ill, and when the doctor came, he had to give him an emetic, and
with difficulty brought him round, when he was at the point of death.
And he scolded his patient, saying to him, &ldquo;A clyster is not
meant to be drunk, but must be administered in the proper way. Why did
you not wait for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So an action, useful in itself, if done contrary to rule, has

the wood to amuse himself. There he was scratched by monkeys, and with

Karpara.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5105src" href="#xd27e5105" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were in a certain city two thieves, named
Gha&#7789;a and Karpara. One night Karpara left Gha&#7789;a outside the
palace, and breaking through the wall, entered the bedchamber of the
princess. And the princess, who could not sleep, saw him there in a
corner, and suddenly falling in love with him, called him to her. And
she gave him wealth, and said to him; &ldquo;I will give you much more
if you come again.&rdquo; Then Karpara went out, and told Gha&#7789;a
what had happened, and gave him the wealth, and having thus got hold of
the king&rsquo;s property, sent him home. But he himself again entered
the women&rsquo;s apartments of the palace; who, that is attracted by
love and covetousness, thinks of death? There he remained with the
princess, and bewildered with love and wine, he fell asleep, and did
not observe that the night was at an end. And in the morning the guards
of the women&rsquo;s apartments entered, and made him prisoner, and
informed the king, and he in his anger ordered him to be put to death.
&ldquo;While he was being led to the place of execution, his friend
Gha&#7789;a came to look for him, as he had not returned in the course
of the night. Then Karpara saw Gha&#7789;a, and made a sign to him that
he was to carry off and take care of the princess. And he answered by a
sign that he would do so. Then Karpara was led away by the
executioners, and being at their mercy, was quickly hanged up upon a
tree, and so executed.</p>
<p>Then Gha&#7789;a went home, sorrowing for his friend, and as soon as
night arrived, he dug a mine and entered the apartment of the princess.
Seeing her in fetters there alone, he went up to her and said; &ldquo;I
am the friend of Karpara, who was to-day put to death on account of
you. And out of love <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"
name="pb94">94</a>]</span>for him I am come here to carry you off, so
come along, before your father does you an injury.&rdquo; Thereupon she
consented joyfully, and he removed her bonds. Then he went out with
her, who at once committed herself to his care, by the underground
passage he had made, and returned to his own house.</p>
<p>And next morning the king heard that his own daughter had been
carried off by some one, who had dug a secret mine, and that king
thought to himself, &ldquo;Undoubtedly that wicked man whom I punished
has some audacious friend, who has carried off my daughter in this
way.&rdquo; So he set his servants to watch the body of Karpara, and he
said to them<span class="corr" id="xd27e5124" title=
"Source: .">,</span> &ldquo;You must arrest any one who may come here
lamenting, to burn the corpse and perform the other rites, and so I
shall recover that wicked girl who has disgraced her family.&rdquo;
When those guards had received this order from the king, they said,
&ldquo;We will do so,&rdquo; and remained continually watching the
corpse of Karpara.</p>
<p>Then Gha&#7789;a made enquiries, and found out what was going on,
and said to the princess; &ldquo;My dear, my comrade Karpara was a very
dear friend to me, and by means of him I gained you and all these
valuable jewels; so until I have paid to him the debt of friendship, I
cannot rest in peace. So I will go and see his corpse, and by a device
of mine manage to lament over it, and I will in due course burn the
body, and scatter the bones in a holy place. And do not be afraid, I am
not reckless like Karpara.&rdquo; After he had said this to her, he
immediately assumed the appearance of a P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic,
and taking boiled rice and milk in a pot, he went near the corpse of
Karpara, as if he were a person passing that way casually, and when he
got near it, he slipped, and let fall from his hand and broke that pot
of milk and rice, and began lamenting, &ldquo;O Karpara full of
sweetness,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5129src" href="#xd27e5129"
name="xd27e5129src">3</a> and so on. And the guards thought that he was
grieving for his pot full of food, that he had got by begging. And
immediately he went home and told that to the princess. And the next
day he made a servant, dressed as a bride, go in front of him, and he
had another behind him, carrying a vessel full of sweetmeats, in which
the juice of the Dhatt&uacute;ra had been infused. And he himself
assumed the appearance of a drunken villager, and so in the evening he
came reeling along past those guards, who were watching the body of
Karpara. They said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, friend, and who is this
lady, and where are you going?&rdquo; Then the cunning fellow answered
them with stuttering accents, &ldquo;I am a villager; this is my wife;
I am going <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>to the house of my father-in-law; and I am taking
for him this complimentary present of sweetmeats. But you have now
become my friends by speaking to me, so I will take only half of the
sweetmeats there; take the other half for yourselves.&rdquo; Saying
this, he gave a sweetmeat to each of the guards. And they received
them, laughing, and all of them partook of them. Accordingly
Gha&#7789;a, having stupefied the guards with Dhatt&uacute;ra, at night
brought fuel<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5137src" href="#xd27e5137"
name="xd27e5137src">4</a> and burnt the body of Karpara.</p>
<p>The next morning, after he had departed, the king hearing of it,
removed those guards who had been stupefied, and placed others there,
and said; &ldquo;You must guard these bones, and you must arrest
whoever attempts to take them away, and you must not accept food from
any outsider.&rdquo; When the guards were thus instructed by the king,
they remained on the lookout day and night, and Gha&#7789;a heard of
it. Then he, being acquainted with the operation of a bewildering charm
granted him by Durg&aacute;, made a wandering mendicant his friend, in
order to make them repose confidence in him. And he went there with
that wandering mendicant, who was muttering spells, and bewildered
those guards, and recovered the bones of Karpara. And after throwing
them into the Ganges, he came and related what he had done, and lived
happily with the princess, accompanied by the mendicant. But the king,
hearing that the bones had been carried off, and the men guarding them
stupefied, thought that the whole exploit, beginning with the carrying
off of his daughter, was the doing of a magician. And he had the
following proclamation made in his city; &ldquo;If that magician, who
carried off my daughter, and performed the other exploits connected
with that feat, will reveal himself, I will give him half my
kingdom.&rdquo; When Gha&#7789;a heard this, he wished to reveal
himself, but the princess dissuaded him, saying, &ldquo;Do not do so,
you cannot repose any confidence in this king, who treacherously puts
people to death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5148src" href=
"#xd27e5148" name="xd27e5148src">5</a> Then, for fear that, if he
remained there, the truth might come out, he set out for another
country with the princess and the mendicant.</p>
<p>And on the way the princess said secretly to the mendicant,
&ldquo;The other one of these thieves seduced me, and this one made me
fall from my high rank. The other thief is dead, as for this,
Gha&#7789;a, I do not love him, you are my darling.&rdquo; When she had
said this, she united herself to the mendicant, and killed Gha&#7789;a
in the dead of night. Then, as she was journeying along with that
mendicant, the wicked woman fell in with a merchant on the way, whose
name was Dhanadeva. So she said, &ldquo;Who is this skull-bearer?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>You are my darling,&rdquo; and she left that
mendicant, while he was asleep, and went off with that merchant. And in
the morning the mendicant woke up, and reflected, &ldquo;There is no
love in women, and no courtesy free from fickleness, for, after lulling
me into security, the wicked woman has gone off, and robbed me too.
However, I ought perhaps to consider myself lucky, that I have not been
killed like Gha&#7789;a.&rdquo; After these reflections, the mendicant
returned to his own country.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And the princess, travelling on with the merchant,
reached his country. And when Dhanadeva arrived there, he said to
himself; &ldquo;Why should I rashly introduce this unchaste woman into
my house? So, as it was evening, he went into the house of an old woman
in that place, with the princess. And at night he asked that old woman,
who did not recognize him, &ldquo;Mother, do you know any tidings about
the family of Dhanadeva?&rdquo; When the old woman heard that, she
said, &ldquo;What tidings is there except that his wife is always ready
to take a new lover. For a basket, covered with leather, is let down
every night from the window here, and whoever enters it, is drawn up
into the house, and is dismissed in the same way at the end of the
night. And the woman is always stupefied with drink, so that she is
absolutely void of discernment. And this state of hers has become
well-known in the whole city. And though her husband has been long
away, he has not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dhanadeva heard this speech of the old woman&rsquo;s, he went
out that moment on some pretext, and repaired to his own house, being
full of inward grief and uncertainty. And seeing a basket let down by
the female servants with ropes, he entered it, and they pulled up him
into the house. And his wife, who was stupefied with drink, embraced
him most affectionately, without knowing who he was. But he was quite
cast down at seeing her degradation. And thereupon she fell into a
drunken sleep. And at the end of the night, the female servants let him
down again quickly from the window, in the basket suspended with ropes.
And the merchant reflected in his grief, &ldquo;Enough of the folly of
being a family man, for women in a house are a snare! It is always this
story with them, so a life in the forest is much to be
preferred.&rdquo; Having formed this resolve, Dhanadeva abandoned the
princess into the bargain, and set out for a distant forest. And on the
way he met, and struck up a friendship with, a young Br&aacute;hman,
named Rudrasoma, who had lately returned from a long absence abroad.
When he told him his story, the Br&aacute;hman became anxious about his
own wife; and so he arrived in the company of that merchant at his own
village in the evening.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And when he arrived there, he saw a cowherd, on the
bank of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

beside himself. So he said to him in joke, &ldquo;Cowherd, is any young
woman in love with you, that you sing thus in your rapture, counting
the world as stubble?&rdquo; &ldquo;When the cowherd heard that, he
laughed and said, &ldquo;I have a great secret.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5180src" href="#xd27e5180" name="xd27e5180src">6</a> The head of
this village, a Br&aacute;hman, named Rudrasoma, has been long away,
and I visit his wife every night; her maid introduces me into the house
dressed as a woman.&rdquo; When Rudrasoma heard this, he restrained his
anger, and wishing to find out the truth, he said to the cowherd;
&ldquo;If such kindness is shewn to guests here, give me this dress of
yours, and let me go there to-night: I feel great curiosity about
it.&rdquo; The cowherd said, &ldquo;Do so, take this black rug of mine,
and this stick, and remain here until her maid comes. And she will take
you for me, and will give you a female dress, and invite you to come,
so go there boldly at night, and I will take repose this night.&rdquo;
When the cowherd said this, the Br&aacute;hman Rudrasoma took from him
the stick and the rug, and stood there, personating him. And the
cowherd stood at a little distance, with that merchant <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e5189" title="Source: Devadatta">Dhanadeva</span>, and
then the maid came. She walked silently up to him in the darkness, and
wrapped him up in a woman&rsquo;s dress, and said to him, &ldquo;Come
along,&rdquo; and so took him off to his wife, thinking that he was the
cowherd. When his wife saw Rudrasoma, she sprang up and embraced him,
supposing that he was the cowherd, and then Rudrasoma thought to
himself; &ldquo;Alas! wicked women fall in love with a base man, if
only he is near them, for this vicious wife of mine has fallen in love
with a cowherd, merely because be is near at hand.&rdquo; Then he made
some excuse with faltering voice, and went, disgusted in mind, to
Dhanadeva. And after he had told his adventure in his own house, he
said to that merchant; &ldquo;I too will go with you to the forest;
perish my family!&rdquo; So Rudrasoma and the merchant Dhanadeva set
out together for the forest.</p>

<p class="first">And on the way a friend of Dhanadeva&rsquo;s, named
&#346;a&#347;in, joined them. And in the course of conversation they
told him their circumstances. And when &#346;a&#347;in heard that,
being a jealous man, and having just returned from a long absence in a
foreign land, he became anxious about his wife, though he had locked
her up in a cellar. And &#346;a&#347;in, travelling along with them,
came near his own house in the evening, and was desirous of
entertaining them. But he saw there a man singing in an amorous mood,
who had an evil smell, and whose hands and feet were eaten away with
leprosy. And in his astonishment, he asked him; &ldquo;Who are you,
sir, that you are so cheerful?&rdquo; And the leper said to him,
&ldquo;I am the god of love.&rdquo; &#346;a&#347;in answered,
&ldquo;There can be no mistake about that. The splendour of your beauty
is sufficient evidence for your being the god of love.&rdquo; Thereupon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

you something. A rogue here, named &#346;a&#347;in, being jealous of
his wife, locked her up in a cellar with one servant to attend on her,
and went to a foreign land. But that wife of his happened to see me
here, and immediately surrendered herself to me, her heart being drawn
towards me by love. And I spend every night with her, for the maid
takes me on her back and carries me in. So tell me if I am not the god
of love. Who, that was the favoured lover of the beautiful wife of
&#346;a&#347;in, could care for other women?&rdquo; When
&#346;a&#347;in heard this speech of the leper&rsquo;s, he suppressed
his grief, intolerable as a hurricane, and wishing to discover the
truth, he said to the leper, &ldquo;In truth you are the god of love,
so I have a boon to crave of your godship. I feel great curiosity about
this lady from your description of her, so I will go there this very
night disguised as yourself. Be propitious to your suppliant: you will
lose but little, as you can attain this object every day.&rdquo; When
&#346;a&#347;in made this request, the leper said to him; &ldquo;So be
it! take this dress of mine and give me yours, and remain covering up
your hands and feet with your clothes, as you see me do, until her maid
comes, which will be as soon as it becomes dark. And she will mistake
you for me, and put you on her back, and you must submit to go there in
that fashion, for I always have to go in that way, having lost the use
of my hands and feet from leprosy.&rdquo; Thereupon &#346;a&#347;in put
on the leper&rsquo;s dress and remained there, but the leper and
&#346;a&#347;in&rsquo;s two companions remained a little way off.</p>
<p>Then &#346;a&#347;in&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s maid came, and supposing
that he was the leper, as he had his dress on, said, &ldquo;Come
along,&rdquo; and took him up on her back. And so she took him at night
into that cellar to his wife, who was expecting her paramour the leper.
Then &#346;a&#347;in made out for certain that it was his wife, who was
lamenting there in the darkness, by feeling her limbs, and he became an
ascetic on the spot. And when she was asleep, he went out unobserved,
and made his way to Dhanadeva and Rudrasoma. And he told them his
experiences, and said in his grief, &ldquo;Alas! women are like
torrents that flow in a ravine, they are ever tending downwards,
capricious, beautiful at a distance, prone to turbidness, and so they
are as difficult to guard as such rivers are to drink, and thus my
wife, though kept in a cellar, has run after a leper. So for me also
the forest is the best thing. Out on family life!&rdquo; And so he
spent the night in the company of the merchant and the Br&aacute;hman,
whose affliction was the same as his. And next morning they all set out
together for the forest, and at evening they reached a tree by the
roadside, with a tank at its foot. And after they had eaten and drunk,
they ascended the tree to sleep, and while they were there, they saw a
traveller come and lie down underneath the tree.</p>

embraced the traveller. And he asked her who they were, and she
answered; &ldquo;This is a snake-god, and I am his wife, a daughter of

darkness of their souls, and became liberated from the necessity of
future births. But their wicked wives fell into a miserable state by
the ripening of their own sin, and were soon ruined, losing both this
and the next world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So attachment to women, the result of infatuation, produces
misery to all men. But indifference to them produces in the discerning
emancipation from the bonds of existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince, who was longing for union with
&#346;aktiya&#347;as, had patiently listened to this diverting tale,
told by his minister Gomukha, he again went to sleep.</p>

<h3 class="main">Note on the Story of Gha&#7789;a and Karpara.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The portion of the story of &ldquo;the Shifty
lad,&rdquo; which so nearly resembles the story of Gha&#7789;a and
Karpara, runs as follows: The shifty lad remarks to his master the
wright, that he might get plenty from the king&rsquo;s store-house
which was near at hand, if only he would break into it. The two
eventually rob it together. &ldquo;But the king&rsquo;s people missed
the butter and cheese and the other things that had been taken out of
the store-house, and they told the king how it had happened. The king
took the advice of the Seanagal about the best way of catching the
thieves, and the counsel that he gave them was, that they should set a
hogshead of soft pitch under the hole where they were coming in. That
was done, and the next day the shifty lad and his master went to break
into the king&rsquo;s store-house.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>The consequence was that the wright was caught in the pitch.
Thereupon the shifty lad cut off his head, which he carried home and
buried in the garden. When the king&rsquo;s people came into the
store-house, they found a body, without a head and they could not make
out whose it was. By the advice of the Seanagal the king had the trunk
carried about from town to town by the soldiers on the points of
spears. They were directed to observe if any one cried out on seeing
it. When they were going past the house of the wright, the
wright&rsquo;s wife made a tortured scream, and swift the shifty lad
cut himself with an adze, and he kept saying to the wright&rsquo;s
wife, &ldquo;It is not as bad as thou thinkest.&rdquo; He then tells
the soldier that she is afraid of blood, and therefore the soldier
supposed that he was the wright and she his wife. The king had the body
hung up in an open place, and set soldiers to watch if any should
attempt to take it away, or show pity or grief for it. The shifty lad
drives a horse past with a keg of whisky on each side, and pretends to
be hiding it from the soldiers. They pursue him, capture the whisky,
get dead drunk, and the shifty lad carries off and buries the
wright&rsquo;s body. The king now lets loose a pig to dig up the body.
The soldiers follow the pig, but the wright&rsquo;s widow entertains
them. Meanwhile the shifty lad kills the pig and buries it. The
soldiers are then ordered to live at free quarters among the people,
and wherever they get pig&rsquo;s flesh, unless the people could
explain how they came by it, to make a report to the king. But the
shifty lad kills the soldiers who visit the widow, and persuades the
people to kill all the others in their sleep. The Seanagal next advises
the king to give a feast to all the people. Whoever dared to dance with
the king&rsquo;s daughter would be the culprit. The shifty lad asks her
to dance, she makes a black mark on him, but he puts a similar black
mark on twenty others. The king now proclaims that, if the author of
these clever tricks will reveal himself, he shall marry his daughter.
All the men with marks on them contend for the honour. It is agreed
that to whomsoever a child shall give an apple, the king is to give his
daughter. The shifty lad goes into the room where they are all
assembled, with a shaving and a drone, and the child gives him the
apple. He marries the princess, but is killed by accident. K&ouml;hler

does not appear to have been aware that this story was to be found in
Somadeva&rsquo;s work. It is found in his Panchatantra, Vol. II, p.
326. He refers to Wolff, II, 1; Knatchbull, 268; Symeon Seth, 76; John

13, (Johnson&rsquo;s translation, page 116.) In Sandabar and Syntipas
the animal is a dog. It appears that the word dog was also used in the
Hebrew translation. John of Capua has <i>canis</i> for ichneumon in
another passage, so perhaps he has it here. Benfey traces the story in

Llewellyn&rsquo;s faithful hound Gelert, from which the parish of
Bethgelert in North Wales is named. This legend has been versified by
the Hon&rsquo;ble William Robert Spencer. It is found in the English

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there lived the son of a rich
merchant, who was an incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva. His
mother died, and his father became attached to another wife, so he sent
him away; and the son went forth from his father&rsquo;s house with his
wife to live in the forest. His younger brother also was banished by
his father, and went with him, but as he was not of a chastened
disposition, the elder brother parted company with him, and went in
another direction. And as he was going along, he at last came to a
great desert wilderness, without water, grass, or tree, scorched by the
fierce rays of the sun, and his supplies were exhausted. And he
travelled through it for seven days, and kept his wife, who was
exhausted with hunger and thirst, alive, by giving her his own flesh
and blood, and she drank the blood and ate the flesh. And on the eighth
day he reached a mountain forest, resounding with the surging waters of
a torrent, abounding in shady trees laden with fruit, and in delightful
turf. There he refreshed his wife with water and fruits, and went down
into the mountain-stream that was wreathed with waves, to take a bath.
And there he saw a man with his two feet and his two hands cut off,
being carried along by the current, in need of assistance. Though
exhausted with his long fast, the brave man entered the river, and
rescued this mutilated person. And the compassionate man landed him on
the bank, and said; &ldquo;Who did this to you, my brother?&rdquo; Then
the maimed man answered, &ldquo;My enemies cut off my hands and feet,
and threw me into the river, desiring to inflict on me a painful death.
But you have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>saved me from the water.&rdquo; When the maimed
man told him this, he bandaged his wounds, and gave him food, and then
the noble fellow bathed and took food himself. Then this
merchant&rsquo;s son, who was an incarnation of a Bodhisattva, remained
in that wood with his wife, living on roots and fruits, and engaged in
austerities.</p>
<p>One day, when he was away in search of fruits and roots, his wife
fell in love with that maimed man, whose wounds were healed. And
determining to kill her husband, the wicked woman devised a plot for
doing so in concert with that mutilated man, and she pretended to be
ill. And she pointed out a plant growing in the ravine, where it was
difficult to descend, and the river hard to cross, and said to her
husband; &ldquo;I may live if you bring me that sovereign plant, for I
am sure that the god indicated to me its position in a dream.&rdquo; He
consented, and descended into the ravine to get the plant, by the help
of a rope plaited of grass and fastened to a tree. But when he had got
down, she unfastened the rope; so he fell into the river, and was swept
away by it, as its current was strong. And he was carried an enormous
distance by the river, and flung up on the bank near a certain city,
for his merits preserved his life. Then he climbed up on to the firm
ground, and rested under a tree, as he was fatigued by his immersion in
the water, and thought over the wicked behaviour of his wife. Now it
happened that at that time the king of that city had just died, and in
that country there was an immemorial custom, that an auspicious
elephant was driven about by the citizens, and any man, that he took up
with his trunk and placed on his back, was anointed king.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5286src" href="#xd27e5286" name="xd27e5286src">2</a>
The elephant, wandering about, came near the merchant&rsquo;s son, and,
as if he were Providence pleased with his self-control, took him up,
and put him on his back. Then the merchant&rsquo;s son, who was an
incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva, was immediately taken to the
city and anointed king by the people. When he had obtained the crown,
he did not associate with charming women of coquettish behaviour, but
held converse with the virtues of compassion, cheerfulness and
patience.</p>
<p>And his wife wandered about hither and thither, carrying that maimed
man, who was her paramour, on her back,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5291src" href="#xd27e5291" name="xd27e5291src">3</a> without fear
of her husband, whom she supposed to have been swept away by the river.
And she begged from village to village, and city to city, saying,
&ldquo;This husband of mine has had his hands and feet cut off by his
enemies; I am a devoted wife and support him by begging, so give me
alms. At last she reached the town in which that husband of hers was
king. She begged there in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>the same way, and, as she was
honoured by the citizens as a devoted wife the fame of her virtue
reached the ears of the king. And the king had her summoned, with the
maimed man on her back, and, when she came near, he recognized her and
said; &ldquo;Are you that devoted wife?&rdquo; And the wicked woman,
not recognizing her husband, when surrounded by the splendour of the
kingly office, said, &ldquo;I am that devoted wife, your
Majesty.&rdquo; Then that incarnation of a Bodhisattva laughed, and
said; &ldquo;I too have had practical experience of your wifely
devotion. How comes it that, though I your own husband, who possess
hands and feet, could not tame you, even by giving you my own flesh and
blood, which you kept feeding on like an ogress in human form, this
maimed fellow, though defective in his limbs, has been able to tame you
and make you his beast of burden? Did you carry on your back your
innocent husband, whom you threw into the river? It is owing to that
deed that you have to carry and support this maimed man.&rdquo; When
her husband in these words revealed her past conduct, she recognized
him, and fainting from fear, became like a painted or dead woman. The
ministers in their curiosity said, &ldquo;Tell us, king, what this
means.&rdquo; Then the king told them the whole story. And the
ministers, when they heard that she had conspired against her
husband&rsquo;s life, cut off her nose and ears, and branded her, and
banished her from the country with the maimed man. And in this matter
Fate shewed a becoming combination, for it united a woman without nose
and ears with a man without hands and feet, and a man who was an
incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva, with the splendour of
royalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the way of woman&rsquo;s heart, which is a thing full of
hate, indiscriminating, prone to the base, is difficult to fathom. And
thus good fortune comes spontaneous and unexpected, as if pleased with
them, to those of noble soul, who do not swerve from virtue and who
conquer anger.&rdquo; When the minister Gomukha had told this tale, he
proceeded to relate the following story.</p>

<p class="first">There was a certain man of noble soul, who was an
incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva, whose heart was melted by
compassion only, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>had built a hut in a forest and lived
there, performing austerities. He, while living there, by his power
rescued living beings in distress and Pi&#347;&aacute;ehas, and others
he gratified by presents of water and jewels. One day, as he was
roaming about in the wood to assist others, he saw a great well and
looked into it. And a woman, who was in it, said to him in a loud
voice; &ldquo;Noble sir, here are four of us; myself a woman, a lion,
and a golden-crested bird, and a snake, fallen into this well in the
night; so take us out; have mercy upon us.&rdquo; When he heard this,
he said, &ldquo;Granted that you three fell in because the darkness
made it impossible for you to see your way, but how did the bird fall
in?&rdquo; The woman answered him, &ldquo;It fell in by being caught in
a fowler&rsquo;s net.&rdquo; Then the ascetic tried to lift them out by
the supernatural power of his asceticism, but he could not; on the
contrary, his power was gone. He reflected, &ldquo;Surely this woman is
a sinner, and owing to my having conversed with her, my power is gone
from me. So I will use other means in this case.&rdquo; Then he plaited
a rope of grass, and so drew them all four up out of the well, and they
praised him. And in his astonishment he said to the lion, the bird, and
the snake; &ldquo;Tell me, how come you to have articulate voice, and
what is your history?&rdquo; Then the lion said, &ldquo;We have
articulate speech and we remember our former births, and we are mutual
enemies; hear our stories in turns.&rdquo; So the lion began to tell
his own story as follows:</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a splendid city on the Him&aacute;layas,
called Vaid&uacute;rya&#347;&#7771;inga; and in it there is a prince of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas named Padmave&#347;a, and to him a son was born
named Vajravega. That Vajravega, while he dwelt in the world of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, being a vain-glorious person, quarrelled with any
body and every body, confiding in his courage. His father ordered him
to desist, but he paid no attention to his command. Then his father
cursed him, saying, &ldquo;Fall into the world of mortals.&rdquo; Then
his arrogance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>was extinguished, and his knowledge left him,
and smitten with the curse he wept, and asked his father to name a time
when it should end. Then his father Padmavega thought a little, and
said immediately; &ldquo;You shall become a Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son
on the earth, and display this arrogance once more, and by your
father&rsquo;s curse you shall become a lion and fall into a well. And
a man of noble character, out of compassion, shall draw you out, and
when you have recompensed him in his calamity, you shall be delivered
from this curse.&rdquo; This was the termination of the curse which his
father appointed for him.</p>
<p>Then Vajravega was born in M&aacute;lava as Devaghosha, the son of
Harighosha a Br&aacute;hman. And in that birth also he fought with
many, confiding in his heroism, and his father said to him, &ldquo;Do
not go on in this way quarrelling with every body.&rdquo; But he would
not obey his father&rsquo;s orders, so his father cursed
him&mdash;&ldquo;Become immediately a foolish lion, over-confident in
its strength.&rdquo; In consequence of this speech of his
father&rsquo;s, Devaghosha, that incarnation of a Vidy&aacute;dhara,
was again born as a lion in this forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know that I am that lion. I was wandering about here at
night, and as chance would have it, I fell into this well; and you,
noble sir, have drawn me up out of it. So now I will depart, and, if
you should fall into any difficulty, remember me; I will do you a good
turn and so get released from my curse.&rdquo; After the lion had said
this be went away, and the golden-crested bird, being questioned by
that Bodhisattva, told his tale.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on the Him&aacute;layas a king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Vajradansh&#7789;ra. His queen gave birth to
five daughters in succession. And then the king propitiated &#346;iva
with austerities and obtained a son, named Rajatadansh&#7789;ra, whom
he valued more than life. His father, out of affection, bestowed the
knowledge of the sciences upon him when he was still a child, and he
grew up, a feast to the eyes of his relations.</p>
<p>One day he saw his eldest sister, by name Somaprabh&aacute;, playing
upon a <i lang="sa-latn">pinjara</i>. In his childishness he kept
begging for the <i lang="sa-latn">pinjara</i>, saying, &ldquo;Give it
me, I too want to play on it.&rdquo; And when she would not give it
him, in his flightiness he seized the <i lang="sa-latn">pinjara</i>,
and flew up to heaven with it in the form of a bird. Then his sister
cursed him, saying;&mdash;&ldquo;Since you have taken my <i lang=
"sa-latn">pinjara</i> from me by force, and flown away with it, you
shall become a bird with a golden crest.&rdquo; When
Rajatadansh&#7789;ra heard this, he fell at his sister&rsquo;s feet,
and entreated her to fix a time for his curse to end, and she said,
&ldquo;When, foolish boy, you fall, in your bird-form, into a blind
well, and a certain merciful person draws you out, and you do him a
service in return, then you shall be released from this curse.&rdquo;
When she had said this to her brother, he was born as a bird with a
golden crest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=

<p>&ldquo;I am that same golden-crested bird, that fell into this pit
in the night, and have now been drawn out by you, so now I will depart.
Remember me when you fall into calamity, for by doing you a service in
return I shall be released from my curse.&rdquo; When the bird had said
this, he departed. Then the snake, being questioned by that
Bodhisattva, told his story to that great-souled one.</p>

<h3 class="main">The snake&rsquo;s story.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Formerly I was the son of a hermit in the hermitage of
Ka&#347;yapa. And I had a companion there who was also the son of a
hermit. And one day my friend went down into the lake to bathe, and I
remained on the bank. And while I was there, I saw a serpent come with
three heads. And, in order to terrify that friend of mine in fun, I
fixed the serpent immoveable on the bank, opposite to where he was, by
the power of a spell. My friend got through his bathing in a moment,
and came to the bank, and unexpectedly seeing that great serpent there,
he was terrified and fainted. After some time I brought my friend round
again, but he, finding out by meditation that I had terrified him in
this way, became angry, and cursed me, saying, &ldquo;Go and become a
similar great snake with three crests.&rdquo; Then I entreated him to
fix an end to my curse, and he said,&mdash;&ldquo;When, in your serpent
condition, you fall into a well, and at a critical moment do a service
to the man who pulls you out, then you shall be freed from your
curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he had said this, he departed, and I became a serpent,
and now you have drawn me out of the well; so now I will depart. And
when you think of me I will come; and by doing you a service I shall be
released from my curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the snake had said this, he departed, and the woman told her
story.</p>

<h3 class="main">The woman&rsquo;s story.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am the wife of a young Kshatriya in the king&rsquo;s
employ, a man in the bloom of youth, brave, generous, handsome, and
high-minded. Nevertheless I was wicked enough to enter into an intrigue
with another man. When my husband found it out, he determined to punish
me. And I heard of this from my confidante, and that moment I fled, and
entered this wood at night, and fell into this well, and was dragged
out by you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thanks to your kindness I will now go and maintain myself
somewhere. May a day come when I shall be able to requite your
goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sinful woman had said this to the Bodhisattva, she went to
the town of a king named Gotravardhana. She obtained an interview, with
him, and remained among his attendants, in the capacity of maid to the
king&rsquo;s principal queen. But because that Bodhisattva talked with
that woman, he lost his power, and could not procure fruits and roots
and things of that kind. Then, being exhausted with hunger and thirst,
he first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>thought of the lion. And, when he thought of
him, he came and fed him with the flesh of deer,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5386src" href="#xd27e5386" name="xd27e5386src">5</a> and in a
short time he restored him to his former health with their flesh; and
then the lion said, &ldquo;My curse is at an end, I will depart.&rdquo;
When he had said this, the Bodhisattva gave him leave to depart, and
the lion became a Vidy&aacute;dhara and went to his own place.</p>
<p>Then that incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva, being again
exhausted by want of food, thought upon that golden-crested bird, and
he came, when thought of by him. And when he told the bird of his
sufferings, the bird went and brought a casket full of jewels<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5391src" href="#xd27e5391" name="xd27e5391src">6</a>
and gave it him, and said, &ldquo;This wealth will support you for
ever, and so my curse has come to an end, now I depart; may you enjoy
happiness!&rdquo; When he had said this, he became a young
Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, and went through the air to his own world,
and received the kingdom from his father. And the Bodhisattva, as he
was wandering about to sell the jewels, reached that city, where the
woman was living whom he had rescued from the well. And he deposited
those jewels in an out-of-the-way house belonging to an old
Br&aacute;hman woman, and went to the market, and on the way he saw
coming towards him the very woman whom he had saved from the well, and
the woman saw him. And the two fell into a conversation, and in the
course of it the woman told him of her position about the person of the
queen. And she asked him about his own adventures: so the confiding man
told her how the golden-crested bird had given him the jewels. And he
took her and shewed her the jewels in the house of the old woman, and
the wicked woman went and told her mistress the queen of it. Now it
happened that the golden-crested bird had managed artfully to steal
this casket of jewels from the interior of the queen&rsquo;s palace,
before her eyes. And when the queen heard from the mouth of that woman,
who knew the facts, that the casket had arrived in the city, she
informed the king. And the king had the Bodhisattva pointed out by that
wicked woman, and brought by his servants as a prisoner from that house
with the ornaments. And after he had asked him the circumstances,
though he believed his account, he not only took the ornaments from
him, but he put him in prison.</p>
<p>Then the Bodhisattva, terrified at being put in prison, thought upon
the snake, who was an incarnation of the hermit&rsquo;s son, and the
snake came to him. And when the snake had seen him, and enquired what
his need was, he said to the good man, &ldquo;I will go and coil round
the king from his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>head to his feet.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5398src" href="#xd27e5398" name="xd27e5398src">7</a> And I will
not let him go until I am told to do so by you. And you must say here,
in the prison, &lsquo;I will deliver the king from the serpent.&rsquo;
And when you come and give me the order, I will let the king go. And
when I let him go, he will give you half his kingdom.&rdquo; After he
had said this, the snake went and coiled round the king, and placed his
three hoods on his head. And the people began to cry out, &ldquo;Alas!
the king is bitten by a snake.&rdquo; Then the Bodhisattva said,
&ldquo;I will deliver the king from this snake.&rdquo; And the
king&rsquo;s servants, having heard this, informed him. Thereupon the
king, who was in the grasp of the snake, had the Bodhisattva summoned,
and said to him, &ldquo;If you deliver me from this snake, I will give
you half my kingdom, and these my ministers are your guarantees that I
will keep my promise.&rdquo; When his ministers heard this, they
said,&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and then the Bodhisattva said to
that snake, &ldquo;Let the king go at once.&rdquo; Then the snake let
the king go, and the king gave half his kingdom to that Bodhisattva,
and thus he became prosperous in a moment. And the serpent, as its
curse was at an end, became a young hermit, and he told his story in
the presence of the court and went back to his hermitage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus you see that good fortune certainly befalls those of
good dispositions. And transgression brings suffering even upon the
great. And the mind of women cannot be relied upon, it is not touched
even by such a service as rescue from death; so what other benefit can
move them?&rdquo; When Gomukha had told this tale, he said to the king
of Vatsa, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you some more stories of
fools.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Buddhist monk who was bitten by a
dog.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in a certain Buddhist monastery a Buddhist
monk of dull intellect. One day, as he was walking in the high road, he
was bitten by a dog on the knee. And when he had been thus bitten, he
returned to his monastery, and thus reflected,&mdash;&ldquo;Every body,
one after another, will ask me, &lsquo;What has happened to your
knee?&rsquo; And what a time it will take me to inform them all one by
one! So I will make use of an artifice to let them all know at
once.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, he quickly went to the top of the
monastery, and taking the stick with which the gong was struck, he
sounded the gong. And the mendicant monks, hearing it, came together in
astonishment, and said to him, &ldquo;Why do you without cause sound
the gong at the wrong time?&rdquo; He answered the mendicants, at the
same time shewing them his knee, &ldquo;The fact is, a dog has bitten
my knee, so I called you together, thinking that it would take a long
time for me to tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span>each of you separately such a long story:
so hear it all of you now, and look at my knee.&rdquo; Then all the
mendicants laughed till their sides ached, and said, &ldquo;What a
great fuss he has made about a very small matter!&rdquo;</p>

sooner than share his food with a guest.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived somewhere a rich but foolish <i lang=

"#xd27e5428" name="xd27e5428src">8</a> who was a miser. And he and his
wife were always eating barley-meal without salt. And he never learned
to know the taste of any other food. Once Providence instigated him to
say to his wife, &ldquo;I have conceived a desire for a milk-pudding:
cook me one to-day.&rdquo; His wife said, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and set
about cooking the pudding, and the <i lang="sa-latn">&#7788;akka</i>
remained in doors concealed, taking to his bed, for fear some one
should see him and drop in on him as a guest.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a friend of his, a <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7788;akka</i> who was fond of mischief, came there, and
asked his wife where her husband was. And she, without giving an
answer, went in to her husband, and told him of the arrival of his
friend. And he, lying on the bed, said to her; &ldquo;Sit down here,
and remain weeping and clinging to my feet, and say to my friend,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5454" title=

When he is gone, we will eat this pudding happily together.&rdquo; When
he gave her this order, she began to weep, and the friend came in, and
said to her, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; She said to him
&ldquo;Look, my husband is dead.&rdquo; But he reflected, &ldquo;I saw
her a moment ago happy enough cooking a pudding. How comes it that her
husband is now dead, though he has had no illness? The two things are
incompatible. No doubt the two have invented this fiction because they
saw I had come as a guest. So I will not go.&rdquo; Thereupon the
mischievous fellow sat down, and began crying out, &ldquo;Alas my
friend! Alas, my friend!&rdquo; Then his relations, hearing the
lamentation, came in and prepared to take that silly <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7788;akka</i> to the burning-place, for he still continued
to counterfeit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=

his ear, &ldquo;Jump up, before these relations take you off to the
pyre and burn you.&rdquo; But the foolish man answered his wife in a
whisper, &ldquo;No! that will never do, for this cunning <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7788;akka</i> wishes to eat my pudding. I cannot get up,
for it was on his arrival that I died. For to people like me the
contemplation of one&rsquo;s possessions is dearer than life.&rdquo;
Then that wicked friend and his relations carried him out, but he
remained immoveable, even while he was being burned, and kept silence
till he died. So the foolish man sacrificed his life but saved his
pudding, and others enjoyed at ease the wealth he had acquired with
much toil.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the foolish teacher, the foolish pupils, and
the cat.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Ujjayin&iacute; there lived in a convent a foolish
teacher. And he could not sleep, because mice troubled him at night.
And wearied with this infliction, he told the whole story to a friend.
The friend, who was a Br&aacute;hman, said to that teacher, &ldquo;You
must set up a cat, it will eat the mice.&rdquo; The teacher said,
&ldquo;What sort of creature is a cat? Where can one be found? I never
came across one.&rdquo; When the teacher said this, the friend replied,
&ldquo;Its eyes are like glass, its colour is a brownish grey, it has a
hairy skin on its back, and it wanders about in roads. So, my friend,
you must quickly discover a cat by these signs and have one
brought.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> After
his friend had said this, he went home. Then that foolish teacher said
to his pupils, &ldquo;You have been present and heard all the
distinguishing marks of a cat. So look about for a cat, such as you
have heard described, in the roads here.&rdquo; Accordingly the pupils
went and searched hither and thither, but they did not find a cat
anywhere.</p>
<p>Then at last they saw a Br&aacute;hman boy coming from the opening
of a road, his eyes were like glass, his colour brownish grey, and he
wore on his back a hairy antelope-skin. And when they saw him they
said, &ldquo;Here we have got the cat according to the
description.&rdquo; So they seized him, and took him to their teacher.
Their teacher also observed that he had got the characteristics
mentioned by his friend; so he placed him in the convent at night. And
the silly boy himself believed that he was a cat, when he heard the
description that those fools gave of the animal. Now it happened that
the silly boy was a pupil of that Br&aacute;hman, who out of friendship
gave that teacher the description of the cat. And that Br&aacute;hman
came in the morning, and, seeing the boy in the convent, said to those
fools, &ldquo;Who brought this fellow here?&rdquo; The teacher and his
foolish pupils answered, &ldquo;We brought him here as a cat, according
to the description which we heard from you.&rdquo; Then the
Br&aacute;hman laughed and said, &ldquo;There is considerable
difference between a stupid human being, and a cat, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>which is an animal with four feet and a
tail.&rdquo; When the foolish fellows heard this, they let the boy go
and said, &ldquo;So let us go and search again for a cat such as has
been now described to us.&rdquo; And the people laughed at those
fools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorance makes every one ridiculous. You have heard of the
fools and their cat, now hear the story of another set of
fools.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the fools and the bull of &#346;iva.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in a certain convent, full of fools, a man
who was the greatest fool of the lot. He once heard in a treatise on
law, which was being read out, that a man, who has a tank made, gains a
great reward in the next world. Then, as he had a large fortune, he had
made a large tank full of water, at no great distance from his own
convent. One day this prince of fools went to take a look at that tank
of his, and perceived that the sand had been scratched up by some
creature. The next day too he came, and saw that the bank had been torn
up in another part of that tank, and being quite astonished, he said to
himself, &ldquo;I will watch here to-morrow the whole day, beginning in
the early morning, and I will find out what creature it is that does
this.&rdquo; After he had formed this resolution, he came there early
next morning, and watched, until at last he saw a bull descend from
heaven and plough up the bank with its horns. He thought, &ldquo;This
is a heavenly bull, so why should I not go to heaven with it?&rdquo;
And he went up to the bull, and with both his hands laid hold of the
tail behind. Then the holy bull lifted up with the utmost force the
foolish man, who was clinging to its tail, and carried him in a moment
to its home in Kail&aacute;sa. There the foolish man lived for some
time in great comfort, feasting on heavenly dainties, sweetmeats, and
other things which he obtained. And seeing that the bull kept going and
returning, that king of fools, bewildered by destiny, thought, &ldquo;I
will go down clinging to the tail of the bull and see my friends, and
after I have told them this wonderful tale, I will return in the same
way.&rdquo; Having formed this resolution, the fool went and clung to
the tail of the bull one day when it was setting out, and so returned
to the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>When he returned to the convent, the other blockheads, who were
there, embraced him, and asked him where he had been, and he told them.
Then all those foolish men, having heard the tale of his adventures,
made this petition to him; &ldquo;Be kind and take us also there,
enable us also to feast on sweetmeats.&rdquo; He consented, and told
them his plan for doing it, and the next day he led them to the border
of the tank and the bull came there. And the principal fool seized the
tail of the bull with his two hands, and another took hold of his feet,
and a third in turn took hold of his. So, when they had formed a chain
by clinging on to one another&rsquo;s feet, the bull flew rapidly up
into the air. And while the bull was going along, with all the fools
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>clinging to his tail, it happened that one of
the fools said to the principal fool; &ldquo;Tell us now, to satisfy
our curiosity; how large were those sweetmeats which you ate, of which
a never-failing supply can be obtained in heaven?&rdquo; Then the
leader had his attention diverted from the business in hand, and
quickly joined his hands together like the cup of a lotus, and
exclaimed in answer, &ldquo;So big.&rdquo; But in so doing he let go
the tail of the bull. And accordingly he and all those others fell from
heaven, and were killed, and the bull returned to Kail&aacute;sa; but
the people, who saw it, were much amused.<a class="noteref" id=

answers without reflection. You have heard about the fools who flew
through the air; hear about this other fool.&rdquo;</p>

village.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain fool, while going to another village, forgot
the way. And when he asked his way, the people said to him; &ldquo;Take
the path that goes up by the tree on the bank of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the fool went and got on the trunk of that tree, and said to
himself, &ldquo;The men told me that my way lay up the trunk of this
tree.&rdquo; And as he went on climbing up it, the bough at the end
bent with his weight, and it was all he could do to avoid falling by
clinging to it.</p>
<p>While he was clinging to it, there came that way an elephant, that
had been drinking water, with his driver on his back. When the fool,
who was clinging to the tree, saw him, he said with humble voice to
that elephant-driver, &ldquo;Great Sir, take me down.&rdquo; And the
elephant-driver let go the elephant-hook, and laid hold of the man by
the feet with both his hands, to take him down from the tree. In the
meanwhile the elephant went on, and the elephant-driver found himself
clinging to the feet of that fool, who was clinging to the end of the
tree. Then the fool said urgently to the elephant-driver, &ldquo;Sing
something quickly, if you know anything, in order that the people may
hear, and come here at once to take us down. Otherwise we shall fall,
and the river will carry us away.&rdquo; When the elephant-driver had
been thus appealed to by him, he sang so sweetly that the fool was much
pleased. And in his desire to applaud him properly, he forgot what he
was about, and let go his hold of the tree, and prepared to clap him
with both his hands. Immediately he and the elephant-driver fell into
the river and were drowned, for association with fools brings
prosperity to no man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the lap of the Him&aacute;layas a country
called Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra, which is the very crest-jewel of the earth,
the home of sciences and virtue. In it there was a town, named
Hira&#7751;yapura, and there reigned in it a king, named
Kanak&aacute;ksha. And there was born to that king, owing to his having
propitiated &#346;iva, a son, named Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, by his
wife Ratnaprabh&aacute;. The prince was one day playing at ball, and he
purposely managed to strike with the ball a female ascetic who came
that way. That female ascetic possessing supernatural powers, who had
overcome the passion of anger, laughed and said to
Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, without altering the expression of her
face,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5526src" href="#xd27e5526" name=

prince heard that, he propitiated the female ascetic and said to her;
&ldquo;Who is this M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;? tell me, reverend
madam.&rdquo; Then she said to him, &ldquo;There is a glorious king of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas on the Him&aacute;layas, named
&#346;a&#347;itejas. He has a beautiful daughter, named
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;, whose loveliness keeps the princes
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas awake at night. And she will be a fitting
wife for you, and you will be a suitable husband for her.&rdquo; When
the female ascetic, who possessed supernatural power, said this to
Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, he replied, &ldquo;Tell me, reverend mother,
how she is to be obtained.&rdquo; Thereupon she said, &ldquo;I will go
and find out how she is affected towards you, by talking about you. And
then I will come and take you there. And you will find me to-morrow in
the temple of the god here, named Amare&#347;a, for I come here every
day to worship him.&rdquo; After the female ascetic had said this, she
went through the air by her supernatural power to the Him&aacute;layas,
to visit that M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;. Then she praised to
her so artfully the good qualities of Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, that
the celestial maiden became very much in love with him, and said to
her, &ldquo;If, reverend mother, I cannot manage to obtain a husband of
this kind, of what use to me is this my purposeless life?&rdquo; So the
emotion of love was produced in M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;, and
she spent the day in talking about him, and passed the night with that
female ascetic. In the meanwhile Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha spent the day
in thinking of her, and with difficulty slept at night, but towards the
end of the night P&aacute;rvat&iacute; said to him in a dream,
&ldquo;Thou art a Vidy&aacute;dhara, become a mortal by the curse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>of a hermit, and thou shalt be delivered from it
by the touch of the hand of this female ascetic, and then thou shalt
quickly marry this M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;. Do not be anxious
about it, for she was thy wife in a former state.&rdquo; Having said
this, the goddess disappeared from his sight. And in the morning the
prince woke and rose up, and performed the auspicious ceremonies of
bathing and so on. Then he went and adored Amare&#347;a and stood in
his presence, since it was there that the female ascetic had appointed
him a rendezvous.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute; fell asleep with
difficulty in her own palace, and P&aacute;rvat&iacute; said to her in
a dream, &ldquo;Do not grieve, the curse of Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha is
at an end, and he will again become a Vidy&aacute;dhara by the touch of
the hand of the female ascetic, and thou shalt have him once more for a
husband.&rdquo; When the goddess had said this, she disappeared, and in
the morning M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute; woke up and told the
female ascetic her dream. And the holy ascetic returned to the earth,
and said to Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, who was in the <i>temenos</i> of
Amare&#347;a, &ldquo;Come to the world of Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo;
When she said this, he bent before her, and she took him up in her
arms, and flew up with him to heaven. Then
Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha&rsquo;s curse came to an end, and he became a
prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and he remembered his former birth,
and said to the female ascetic, <span class="corr" id="xd27e5545"

I was cursed by a hermit, angry because I had treated him with neglect,
and I was doomed to live in the world of mortals until touched by your

cursed, has now been born again as M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;,
and so has before been loved by me. And now I will go with you and
obtain her once more, for I have been purified by the touch of your
hand, and my curse is at an end.&rdquo; So said Am&#7771;itatejas, the
Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, as he travelled through the air with that
female ascetic to the Him&aacute;layas. There he saw
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute; in a garden, and she saw him coming,
as he had been described by the female ascetic<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Wonderful to say, these lovers first entered
one another&rsquo;s minds by the ears, and now they entered them by the
eyes, without ever having gone out again.</p>
<p>Then that outspoken female ascetic said to
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;, &ldquo;Tell this to your father with
a view to your marriage.&rdquo; She instantly went, with a face
downcast from modesty, and informed her father of all through her
confidante. And it happened that her father also had been told how to
act by P&aacute;rvat&iacute; in a dream, so he received
Am&#7771;itatejas into his palace with all due honour. And he bestowed
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute; on him with the prescribed
ceremonies, and after he was married, he went to the city of
Vajrak&uacute;&#7789;a. There he got back his kingdom as well as his
wife, and he had his father Kanak&aacute;ksha brought there, by means
of the holy female ascetic, as he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>a mortal, and he
gratified him with heavenly enjoyments and sent him back again to
earth, and long enjoyed his prosperity with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkalekh&aacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that the destiny fixed for any creature in this
world, by works in a former birth, falls as it were before his feet,
and he attains it with ease, though apparently unattainable.&rdquo;
When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this tale of Gomukha&rsquo;s, he was
enabled to sleep that night, though pining for
&#346;aktiya&#347;as.</p>

<p class="first">The next night Gomukha told the following story to
Narav&aacute;hanadatta to amuse him.</p>
<p>In the holy place of &#346;iva, called Dhane&#347;vara, there lived
long ago a great hermit, who was waited upon by many pupils. He once
said to his pupils, &ldquo;If any one of you has seen or heard in his
life a strange occurrence of any kind, let him relate it.<span class=

a pupil said to him, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell a strange story which I

<h3 class="main">Story of the mendicant who travelled from
Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra to P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra a famous holy place,
sacred to &#346;iva, called Vijaya. In it there lived a certain
mendicant, who was proud of his knowledge. He worshipped &#346;iva, and
prayed&mdash;&ldquo;May I be always victorious in
controversy,&rdquo;&mdash;and thereupon he set out for
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra to exhibit his skill in dispute. And on the
way he passed forests, rivers, and mountains, and having reached a
certain forest, he became tired, and rested under a tree. And
immediately he saw, as he was refreshing himself in the cool breeze of
the tank, a student of religion, who had come there dusty with a long
journey, with his staff and water-pot in his hand. When he sat down,
the wandering mendicant asked him whence he came and whither he was
going. The student of religion answered, &ldquo;I come from that seat
of learning P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and I am going to
Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra to conquer the Pa&#7751;&#7693;its there in
discussion. When the mendicant heard this speech of the religious
student&rsquo;s, he thought, &ldquo;If I cannot conquer this one man
who has left P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, how shall I manage to go and
overcome the many who remain there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So reflecting, he began to reproach that religious student,
&ldquo;Tell me, religious student, what is the meaning of this
inconsistent conduct on your part? How comes it that you are at the
same time a religious student, eager for liberation, and a man
afflicted with the madness of disputatiousness? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>Do
you seek to be delivered from the world by binding yourself with the
conceit of controversy? You are quenching heat with fire, and removing
the feeling of cold with snow; you are trying to cross the sea on a
boat of stone; you are striving to put out a fire by fanning it. The
virtue of Br&aacute;hmans is patience, that of Kshatriyas is the rescue
of the distressed; the characteristic quality of one who desires
liberation is quietism; disputatiousness is said to be the
characteristic of R&aacute;kshasas. Therefore a man who desires
liberation must be of a quiet temperament, putting away the pain
arising from alternations of opposites, fearing the hindrances of the
world. So cut down with the axe of quietism this tree of mundane
existence, and do not water it with the water of controversial
conceit.&rdquo; When he said this to the religious student, he was
pleased, and bowed humbly before him, and saying, &ldquo;Be you my
spiritual guide,&rdquo;&mdash;he departed by the way that he came. And
the mendicant remained, laughing, where he was, at the foot of the
tree, and then he heard from within it the conversation of a Yaksha,
who was joking with his wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5580src" href=
"#xd27e5580" name="xd27e5580src">1</a> And while the mendicant was
listening, the Yaksha in sport struck his wife with a garland of
flowers, and she, like a cunning female, pretended that she was dead,
and immediately her attendants raised a cry of grief. And after a long
time she opened her eyes, as if her life had returned to her. Then the
Yaksha her husband said to her; &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; Then
she told the following invented story; &ldquo;When you struck me with
the garland, I saw a black man come, with a noose in his hand, with
flaming eyes, tall, with upstanding hair, terrible, darkening the whole
horizon with his shadow. The ruffian took me to the abode of Yama, but
his officers there turned him back, and made him let me go.&rdquo; When
the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; said this, the Yaksha laughed, and said to
her, &ldquo;O dear! women cannot be free from deception in any thing
that they do. Who ever died from being struck with flowers? Who ever
returned from the house of Yama? You silly woman, you have imitated the
tricks of the women of <span class="corr" id="xd27e5583" title=

<h3 class="main">Story of the wife of king Sinh&aacute;ksha, and the
wives of his principal courtiers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For in that city there is a king named
Sinh&aacute;ksha: and his wife, taking with her the wives of his
minister, commander-in-chief, chaplain, and physician, went once on the
thirteenth day of the white fortnight to make a pilgrimage to the
shrine of Sarasvat&iacute;, the protecting deity of that land. There
they, queen and all, met on the way sick persons, humpbacked,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>blind, and lame, and were thus implored by them,
&ldquo;Give medicine to us wretched diseased men, in order that we may
be delivered from our infirmity; have mercy upon the distressed. For
this world is wavering as a wave of the sea, transient as a flash of
lightning, and its beauty is short-lived like that of a religious
festival. So in this unreal world the only real thing is mercy to the
wretched, and charity to the poor; it is only the virtuous person that
can be said truly to live. What is the use of giving to the rich or the
comfortable?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5593src" href="#xd27e5593"
name="xd27e5593src">2</a> What does the cold moon profit a shivering
man, or what is the use of a cloud when winter has arrived? So rescue
us miserable creatures from the affliction of sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the queen and the other ladies had been thus supplicated by
these diseased persons, they said to one another; &ldquo;These poor
afflicted men say what is true, and to the point, so we must endeavour
to restore them to health even at the cost of all our substance.&rdquo;
Then they worshipped the goddess, and each took one of those sick
people to her own house, and, urging on their husbands, they had them
treated with the potent drugs of Mah&aacute;dev&iacute;, and they never
left off watching them. And from being always with them, they fell in
love with them, and became so attached to them that they thought of
nothing else in the world. And their minds, bewildered with love, never
reflected what a difference there was between these wretched sick men
and their own husbands, the king and his chief courtiers.</p>
<p>Then their husbands remarked that they had on them the marks of
scratches and bites, due to their surprising intimacy with these
invalids. And the king, the commander-in-chief, the minister, the
chaplain, and the physician talked of this to one another without
reserve, but not without anxiety. Then the king said to the others,
&ldquo;You keep quiet at present; I will question my wife
dexterously<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; So
he dismissed them, and went to his private apartments, and assuming an
expression of affectionate anxiety, he said to his wife, &ldquo;Who bit
you on the lower lip? Who scratched you on the breast? If you tell me
the truth, it will be well with you, but not otherwise.&rdquo; When the
queen was thus questioned by the king, she told him a fictitious tale,
saying, &ldquo;Ill-fated that I am, I must tell this wonder, though it
ought not to be revealed. Every night a man, with a discus and club,
comes out of the painted wall, and does this to me, and disappears into
it in the morning. And though you, my husband, are alive, he reduces to
this state my body, which not even the sun or moon has ever
beheld.&rdquo; When the foolish king heard this story of hers, told
with much semblance of grief, he believed it, and thought that it was
all a trick played by Vish&#7751;u. And he told it to the minister and
his other servants, and they, like blockheads, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>also
believed that their wives had been visited by Vish&#7751;u, and held
their tongues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way wicked and cunning females, of bad character, by
concurring in one impossible story, deceive silly people, but I am not
such a fool as to be taken in.&rdquo; The Yaksha by saying this covered
his wife with confusion. And the mendicant at the foot of the tree
heard it all. Then the mendicant folded his hands, and said to that
Yaksha, &ldquo;Reverend sir, I have arrived at your hermitage, and now
I throw myself on your protection. So pardon my sin in overhearing what
you have been saying.&rdquo; By thus speaking the truth he gained the
good will of the Yaksha. And the Yaksha said to him, &ldquo;I am a
Yaksha, Sarvasth&aacute;nagav&aacute;ta by name, and I am pleased with
you. So choose a boon.&rdquo; Then the mendicant said to the Yaksha;
&ldquo;Let this be my boon that you will not be angry with this wife of
yours.&rdquo; Then the Yaksha said, &ldquo;I am exceedingly pleased
with you. This boon is already granted, so choose another.&rdquo; Then
the mendicant said, &ldquo;Then this is my second petition, that from
this day forward you and your wife will look upon me as a son.&rdquo;
When the Yaksha heard this, he immediately became visible to him with
his wife, and said, &ldquo;I consent, my son, we regard you as our own
child. And owing to our favour you shall never suffer calamity. And you
shall be invincible in disputation, altercation, and gambling.&rdquo;
When the Yaksha had said this, he disappeared, and the mendicant
worshipped him, and after spending the night there, he went on to
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. Then he announced to king Sinh&aacute;ksha,
by the mouth of the doorkeeper, that he was a disputant come from
Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra. And the king permitted him to enter the hall of
assembly, and there he tauntingly challenged the learned men to dispute
with him. And after he had conquered them all by virtue of the boon of
the Yaksha, he again taunted them in the presence of the king in these
words: &ldquo;I ask you to explain this. What is the meaning of this
statement, &lsquo;A man with a discus and mace comes out of the painted
wall, and bites my lower lip, and scratches my chest, and then
disappears in the wall again.&rsquo; Give me an answer.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5616src" href="#xd27e5616" name="xd27e5616src">3</a>
When the learned men heard his riddle, as they did not know the real
reference, they gave no answer, but looked at one another&rsquo;s
faces. Then the king Sinh&aacute;ksha himself said to him,
&ldquo;Explain to us yourself the meaning of what you said.&rdquo;
Thereupon the mendicant told the king of the deceitful behaviour of his
wife, which he had heard about from the Yaksha. And he said to the
king, &ldquo;So a man should never become attached to women, which will
only result in his knowing wickedness.&rdquo; The king was delighted
with the mendicant, and wished to give him his kingdom. But the
mendicant, who was ardently attached to his own native land, would not
take it. Then the king honoured him with a rich present of jewels. The
mendicant took the jewels and returned to his native land of
Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra, and there by the favour of the Yaksha he lived in
great comfort. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=

days after one <span class="corr" id="xd27e5642" title=
"Source: of of">of</span> the man&rsquo;s sons died. And then his
brother was gored by an ox and died of it. So the householder named his
daughter, &ldquo;Three-slayer,&rdquo; because owing to the birth of
this ill-omened girl three had met their death.</p>
<p>In course of time she grew up, and then the son of a rich man, who
lived in that village, asked her in marriage, and her father gave her
to him with the usual rejoicings. She lived for some time with that
husband, but he soon died. In a few days the fickle woman took another
husband. And the second husband met his death in a short time. Then,
led astray by her youthful feelings, she took a third husband. And the
third husband of this husband-slayer died like the others. In this way
she lost ten husbands in succession. So she got affixed to her by way
of ridicule the name of &ldquo;Ten-slayer.&rdquo; Then her father was
ashamed and would not let her take another husband, and she remained in
her father&rsquo;s house avoided by people. But one day a handsome
young traveller entered it, and was allowed by her father to stop as
his guest for a night. When Ten-slayer saw him, she fell in love with
him, and when he looked at that charming young woman, he too was
captivated. Then Love robbed her of her modesty, and she said to her
father, &ldquo;I choose this traveller as one husband more; if he dies
I will then take a vow.&rdquo; She said this in the hearing of the
traveller, but her father answered her, &ldquo;Do not think of such a
thing, it is too disgraceful; you have lost ten husbands, and if this
one dies too, people will laugh consumedly. When the traveller heard
this, he abandoned all reserve, and said, &ldquo;No chance of my dying,
I have lost ten wives one after another. So we are on a par; I swear
that it is so by the touch of the feet of &#346;iva.&rdquo; When the
traveller said this, every body was astonished. And the villagers
assembled, and with one consent gave permission to Ten-slayer to marry
the traveller, and she took him for her husband. And she lived some
time with him, but at last he was seized with an ague and died. Then
she was called &ldquo;Eleven-slayer,&rdquo; and even the stones could
not help laughing at her: so she betook herself in despondency to the
bank of the Ganges and lived the life of an ascetic.</p>

always one ox.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Gomukha had told this amusing story, he went on
to say&mdash;&ldquo;Hear also the story of the man who subsisted on one
ox.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a certain poor householder in a certain village; and the
only wealth he had in his house was one ox. He was so mean-spirited
that, though his family was on the point of perishing for want of food,
and he himself had to fast, he could not make up his mind to part with
that ox. But he went to the shrine of Durg&aacute; in the Vindhya
hills, and throwing himself down on a bed of <i>darbha</i>-grass, he
performed asceticism without taking food, in order that he might obtain
wealth. The goddess said to him in a dream, &ldquo;Rise up; your wealth
shall always consist of one ox, and by selling it you shall live in
perpetual comfort.&rdquo; So the next morning he woke, and got up, took
some food, and returned to his house. But even then he had not strength
of mind to sell that ox, for he thought that, if he sold it, he would
have nothing left in the world, and be unable to live. Then, as, thin
with fasting, he told his dream with reference to the command of the
goddess, a certain intelligent friend said to him, &ldquo;The goddess
told you that you should always have one ox, and that you should live
by selling it, so why did you not, foolish man, obey the command of the
goddess? So, sell this ox, and support your family. When you have sold
this one, you will get another, and then another.&rdquo; The villager,
on receiving this suggestion from his friend, did so. And he received
ox after ox, and lived in perpetual comfort by selling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, Destiny produces fruit for every man according to
his resolution. So a man should be resolute; good fortune does not
select for favour a man wanting in resolution. Hear now this story of
the cunning rogue who passed himself off as a minister.&rdquo;</p>

speaking to the king.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5663src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a certain king in a city in the Dekkan. In
that city there was a rogue who lived by imposing upon others. And one
day he said to himself, being too ambitious to be satisfied with small
gains; &ldquo;Of what use to me is this petty rascality, which only
provides me with subsistence? Why should I not do a stroke of business
which would bring me great prosperity?&rdquo; Having thus reflected, he
dressed himself splendidly as a merchant, and went to the palace-gate
and accosted the warder. And he introduced him into the king&rsquo;s
presence, and he offered a complimentary gift, and said to the king,
&ldquo;I wish to speak with your Majesty in private.&rdquo; The king
was imposed upon by his dress, and much influenced in his favour by the
present, so he granted him a private interview, and then the rogue said
to him, &ldquo;Will your Majesty have the goodness every day, in the
hall of assembly, to take me aside for a moment in the sight of all,
and speak to me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>in private? And as an acknowledgment of
that favour I will give your Majesty every day five hundred
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and I do not ask for any gift in
return.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he thought to himself,
&ldquo;What harm can it do? What does he take away from me? On the
contrary he is to give me <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> every day. What
disgrace is there in carrying on a conversation with a great
merchant?&rdquo; So the king consented, and did as he requested, and
the rogue gave the king the <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> as he had
promised, and the people thought that he had obtained the position of a
Cabinet Minister.</p>
<p>Now one day the rogue, while he was talking with the king, kept
looking again and again at the face of one official with a significant
expression. And after he came out, that official asked him why he had
looked at his face so, and the rogue was ready with this fiction;
&ldquo;The king is angry because he supposes that you have been
plundering his realm. This is why I looked at your face, but I will
appease his anger.&rdquo; When the sham minister said this, the
official went home in a state of anxiety, and sent him a thousand gold
pieces. And the next day the rogue talked in the same way with the
king, and then he came out and said to the official, who came towards
him; &ldquo;I appeased the king&rsquo;s anger against you with some
judicious words. Cheer up; I will now stand by you in all
emergencies.&rdquo; Thus he artfully made him his friend, and then
dismissed him, and then the official waited upon him with all kinds of
presents.</p>
<p>Thus gradually this dexterous rogue, by means of his continual
conversations with the king, and by many artifices, extracted from the
officials, the subordinate monarchs, the R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts, and the
servants, so much wealth, that he amassed altogether fifty millions of
gold pieces. Then the scoundrelly sham minister said in secret to the
king, &ldquo;Though I have given you every day five hundred
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, nevertheless, by the favour of your
Highness, I have amassed fifty millions of gold pieces. So have the
goodness to accept of this gold. What have I to do with it?&rdquo; Then
he told the king his whole stratagem. But it was with difficulty that
the king could be induced to take half the money. Then he gave him the
post of a Cabinet Minister, and the rogue, having obtained riches and
position, kept complimenting the people with entertainments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus a wise man obtains great wealth without committing a
very great crime, and when he has gained the advantage, he atones for
his fault in the same way as a man who digs a well.&rdquo; Then Gomukha
went on to say to the prince; &ldquo;Listen now to this one story,
though you are excited about your approaching marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Ratnarekh&aacute; and
Lakshm&iacute;sena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in a city, named Ratn&aacute;kara, a king,
named Buddhiprabha, who was a very lion to the infuriated elephant-herd
of his enemies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span><span class="corr" id="xd27e5693" title=
"Source: And">and</span> there was born to him by his queen, named
Ratnarekh&aacute;, a daughter, named Hemaprabh&aacute;, the most
beautiful woman in the whole world. And since she was a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, that had fallen to earth by a curse, she was
fond of amusing herself by swinging, on account of the pleasure that
she felt in recalling the impressions of her roaming through the air in
her former existence. Her father forbade her, being afraid that she
would fall, but she did not desist, so her father was angry and gave
her a slap. The princess was angry at receiving so great an indignity,
and wishing to retire to the forest, she went to a garden outside the
city, on the pretence of amusing herself. She made her servants drunk
with wine, and roaming on, she entered a dense tree-jungle, and got out
of their sight. And she went alone to a distant forest, and there she
built herself a hut, and remained feeding on roots and fruits, engaged
in the adoration of &#346;iva. As for her father, he found out that she
had fled to some place or other, and made search for her, but did not
find her. Then he fell into great grief. And after some time the
king&rsquo;s grief abated a little, so he went out hunting to distract
his mind. And, as it happened, that king Buddhiprabha went to that
distant forest, in which his daughter Hemaprabh&aacute; was engaged in
ascetic practices. There the king saw her hut, and he went into it, and
unexpectedly beheld there his own daughter emaciated with ascetic
practices. And she, when she saw him, rose up at once and embraced his
feet, and her father embraced her with tears and seated her on his lap.
And seeing one another again after so long a separation, they wept so
that even the eyes of the deer in the forest gushed with tears. Then
the king at last comforted his daughter, and said to her, &ldquo;Why
did you abandon, my daughter, the happiness of a palace, and act thus?
So come back to your mother, and give up this forest.&rdquo; When her
father said this to her, Hemaprabh&aacute; answered him, &ldquo;I have
been commanded by the god to act thus. What choice have I in the
matter? So I will not return to the palace to indulge in pleasure, and
I will not abandon the joys of asceticism.&rdquo; When the king
discovered from this speech of hers that she would not abandon her
intention, he had a palace made for her in that very forest. And when
he returned to his capital, he sent her every day cooked food and
wealth, for the entertainment of her guests. And Hemaprabh&aacute;
remained in the forest, honouring her guests with wealth and jewels,
while she lived herself on roots and fruits.</p>
<p>Now one day there came to the hermitage of that princess a female
mendicant, who was roaming about, having observed a vow of chastity
from her earliest youth. This lady, who had been a mendicant from her
childhood, was honoured by Hemaprabh&aacute;, and when asked by her the
reason why she took the vow, she answered, &ldquo;Once, when I was a
girl, I was shampooing my father&rsquo;s feet, and my eyes closed in
sleep, and I let my hands drop. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>Then my father gave me a
kick, and said, &lsquo;Why do you go to sleep?&rsquo; And I was so
angry at that that I left his house and became a mendicant.&rdquo; Then
Hemaprabh&aacute; was so delighted with the female mendicant, on
account of the resemblance of her character to her own, that she made
her share her forest life. And one morning she said to that friend;
&ldquo;My friend, I remember that I crossed in my dreams a broad river,
then I mounted a white elephant, after that I ascended a mountain, and
there I saw in a hermitage the holy god &#346;iva. And having obtained
a lyre, I sang and played on it before him, and then I saw a man of
celestial appearance approach. When I saw him, I flew up into the sky
with you, and when I had seen so much, I awoke, and lo! the night was
at an end.&rdquo; When the friend heard this, she said to
Hemaprabh&aacute;, &ldquo;Undoubtedly, auspicious girl, you must be
some heavenly being born on earth in consequence of a curse; and this
dream means that your curse is nearly at an end.&rdquo; When the
princess heard this speech of her friend&rsquo;s, she received it with
joy.</p>
<p>And when the sun, the lamp of the world, had mounted high in the
heaven, there came there a certain prince on horseback. When he saw
Hemaprabh&aacute; dressed as an ascetic, he dismounted from his horse,
and conceiving admiration for her, he went and saluted her
respectfully. She, for her part, entertained him, and made him take a
seat, and feeling love for him, said, &ldquo;Who are you, noble
sir?&rdquo; Then the prince said, &ldquo;Noble lady, there is a king of
auspicious name, called Prat&aacute;pasena. He was once going through a
course of asceticism to propitiate &#346;iva, with the view of
obtaining a son. And that merciful god appeared to him, and said,
&lsquo;Thou shalt obtain one son, who shall be an incarnation of a
Vidy&aacute;dhara, and he, when his curse is at an end, shall return to
his own world. And thou shalt have a second son, who shall continue thy
race and uphold thy realm.&rsquo; When &#346;iva said this to him, he
rose up in high spirits, and took food. Then he had one son born to
him, named Lakshm&iacute;sena, and in course of time a second, named
&#346;&uacute;rasena. Know, lovely one, that I am that same
Lakshm&iacute;sena, and that to-day when I went out to hunt, my horse,
swift as the wind, ran away with me and brought me here.&rdquo; Then he
asked her history, and she told it him, and thereupon she remembered
her former birth, and was very much elated, and said to him, &ldquo;Now
that I have seen you, I have remembered my birth and the sciences which
I knew as a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5702src" href="#xd27e5702" name="xd27e5702src">6</a> for I and
this friend of mine here are both Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;s, that have
been sent down to earth by a curse. And you were my husband, and your
minister was the husband of this friend of mine. And now that curse of
me and of my friend has lost its power. We shall all meet again in the
world of Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; Then she and her friend assumed
divine forms and flew up to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>heaven, and went to their own
world. But Lakshm&iacute;sena stood for a moment lost in wonder, and
then his minister arrived tracking his course. While the prince was
telling the whole story to him, king Buddhiprabha arrived, anxious to
see his daughter. When he could not see his daughter, but found
Lakshm&iacute;sena there, he asked for news of her, and
Lakshm&iacute;sena told him what had happened. Then Buddhiprabha was
cast down, but Lakshm&iacute;sena and his minister remembered their
former existence, their curse having spent its force, and they went to
their own world through the air. He recovered his wife
Hemaprabh&aacute; and returned with her, and then taking leave of
Buddhiprabha, he went to his own town. And he went with his minister,
who had recovered his wife, and told their adventures to his father
Prat&aacute;pasena, who bestowed on him his kingdom as his successor by
right of birth. But he gave it to his younger brother
&#346;&uacute;rasena, and returned to his own city in the country of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas. There Lakshm&iacute;sena, united with his
consort Hemaprabh&aacute;, and assisted by his minister, long enjoyed
the delights of sovereignty over the Vidy&aacute;dharas.</p>
<p>By hearing these stories told one after another by Gomukha,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, though he was excited about his approaching
marriage with his new wife &#346;aktiya&#347;as, spent that night as if
it were a moment. In this way the prince whiled away the days, until
the day of his marriage arrived, when, as he was in the presence of his
father the king of Vatsa, he suddenly saw the army of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas descend from heaven, gleaming like gold. And he saw,
in the midst of them, Spha&#7789;ikaya&#347;as the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, who had come out of love, holding the hand of his
dear daughter, whom he wished to bestow on the prince, and he joyfully
went towards him, and saluted him by the title of father-in-law, after
his father had first entertained him with the <i lang=
"sa-latn">arghya</i> and other usual ceremonies. And the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas stated the object of his coming, and immediately
created a display of heavenly magnificence becoming his high position,
and by the might of his supernatural power loaded the prince with
jewels, and then bestowed on him in due form his daughter previously
promised to him. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having obtained that
&#346;aktiya&#347;as, the daughter of the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, was resplendent as the lotus after collecting the
rays of the sun. Then Spha&#7789;ikaya&#347;as departed, and the son of
the king of Vatsa remained in the city of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;,
with his eyes fixed on the face of &#346;aktiya&#347;as, as the bee
clings to the lotus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"

<h3 class="main">Story of the race between the elephant and the
horses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And one day, when he was in the garden, two brothers,
who were princes, and who had come from a foreign land, suddenly paid
him a visit. He received them cordially, and they bowed before him, and
one of them said to him; &ldquo;We are the sons by different mothers of
a king in the city of Vai&#347;&aacute;kha. My name is Ruchiradeva and
the name of this brother of mine is Potraka. I have a swift female
elephant, and he has two horses. And a dispute has arisen between us
about them; I say that the elephant is the fleetest, he maintains that
his horses are both fleeter. I have agreed that if I lose the race, I
am to surrender the elephant, but if he loses, he is to give me both
his horses. Now no one but you is fit to be a judge of their relative
speed, so come to my house, my lord, and preside over this trial.
Accede to our request. For you are the wishing-tree that grants all
petitions, and we have come from afar to petition you about this
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince received this invitation from Ruchiradeva, he
consented out of good nature, and out of the interest he took in the
elephant and the horses. He set out in a chariot drawn by swift horses,
which the brothers had brought, and he reached with them that city of
Vai&#347;&aacute;kha. When he entered that splendid city, the ladies,
bewildered and excited, beheld him with eyes the lashes of which were
turned up, and made these comments on him; &ldquo;Who can this be! Can
it be the god of Love new-created from his ashes without Rati? Or a
second moon roaming through the heaven without a spot on its surface?
Or an arrow of desire made by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>the Creator, in the form of a
man, for the sudden complete overthrow of the female heart.&rdquo; Then
the king beheld the all-lovely temple of the god of Love, whose worship
had been established there by men of old time. He entered and
worshipped that god, the source of supreme felicity, and rested for a
moment, and shook off the fatigue of the journey. Then he entered as a
friend the house of Ruchiradeva, which was near that temple, and was
honoured by being made to walk in front of him. He was delighted at the
sight of that magnificent palace, full of splendid horses and
elephants, which was in a state of rejoicing on account of his visit.
There he was entertained with various hospitalities by Ruchiradeva, and
there he beheld his sister of splendid beauty. His mind and his eyes
were so captivated by her glorious beauty, that he forgot all about his
absence from home and his separation from his family. She too threw
lovingly upon him her expanded eye, which resembled a garland of full
blown blue lotuses, and so chose him as her husband.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5736src" href="#xd27e5736" name="xd27e5736src">1</a> Her name
was Jayendrasen&aacute;, and he thought so much upon her that the
goddess of sleep did not take possession of him at night, much less did
other females.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5739src" href="#xd27e5739"
name="xd27e5739src">2</a></p>
<p>The next day Potraka brought that pair of horses equal to the wind
in swiftness; but Ruchiradeva, who was skilled in all the secrets of
the art of driving, himself mounted the female elephant, and partly by
the animal&rsquo;s natural speed, partly by his dexterity in urging it
on, beat them in the race. When Ruchiradeva had beaten those two
splendid horses, the son of the king of Vatsa entered the palace, and
at that very moment arrived a messenger from his father. The messenger,
when he saw the prince, fell at his feet, and said; &ldquo;The king,
hearing from your retinue that you have come here, has sent me to you
with this message. &lsquo;How comes it that you have gone so far from
the garden without letting me know? I am impatient for your return, so
abandon the diversion that occupies your attention, and return
quickly.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When he heard this message from his
father&rsquo;s messenger, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was also intent
on obtaining the object of his flame, was in a state of perplexity.</p>
<p>And at that very moment a merchant, in a great state of delight,
came, bowing at a distance, and praised that prince, saying,
&ldquo;Victory to thee, O thou god of love without the flowery bow!
Victory to thee, O Lord, the future emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas!
Wast thou not seen to be charming as a boy, and when growing up, the
terror of thy foes? So surely the gods shall behold thee like
Vish&#7751;u, striding victorious over the heaven, conquering
Bali.&rdquo; With these and other praises the great merchant magnified
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=

<h3 class="main">Story of the merchant and his wife Vel&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city called Lamp&aacute;, the crown of the
earth; in it there was a rich merchant named Kusumas&aacute;ra. I,
prince of Vatsa, am the son of that merchant, who lives and moves in
religion, and I was gained by the propitiation of &#346;iva. Once on a
time I went with my friends to witness a procession of idols, and I saw
other rich men giving to beggars. Then I formed the design of acquiring
wealth to give away, as I was not satisfied with the vast fortune
accumulated by my father. So I embarked in a ship, laden with many
jewels, to go across the sea to another country. And my ship, impelled
by a favorable wind, as if by fate, reached that island in a few days.
There the king found out that I was an unknown man dealing in valuable
jewels, and out of avarice he threw me into prison. While I was
remaining in that prison, which resembled hell, on account of its being
full of howling criminals, suffering from hunger and thirst, like
wicked ghosts, a merchant, named Mah&iacute;dhara, a resident in that
town, who knew my family, went and interceded with the king on my
behalf, and said; &ldquo;King, this is the son of a great merchant, who
lives in the city of Lamp&aacute;, and, as he is innocent, it is not
creditable to your majesty to keep him in prison.&rdquo; On his making
representations of this kind, the king ordered me to be released from
prison, and summoned me into his presence, and honoured me with a
courteous reception. So, by the favour of the king and the support of
that merchant, I remained there doing a splendid business.</p>
<p>One day I saw, at a spring festival in a garden, a handsome girl,
the daughter of a merchant named &#346;ikhara. I was quite carried off
my feet by her, who was like a wave of the sea of Love&rsquo;s
insolence, and when I found out who she was, I demanded her in marriage
from her father. Her father reflected for a moment, and at last said to
me; &ldquo;I cannot give her to you myself, there is a reason for my
not doing so. But I will send her to her grandfather by the
mother&rsquo;s side, in the island of Ceylon; go there and ask for her
again, and marry her. And I will send her there with such instructions
that your suit will certainly be accepted.&rdquo; When &#346;ikhara had
said this, and had paid me the usual courtesies, he dismissed me to my
own house. And the next day he put the maiden on board ship, with her
attendants, and sent her to the island of Ceylon, across the sea.</p>
<p>I was preparing with the utmost eagerness to go there, when this
rumour, which was terrible as a lightning-stroke, was spread abroad
where I was; &ldquo;The ship, in which the daughter of &#346;ikhara
started, has gone to pieces in the open sea, and not a soul has been
saved out of it.&rdquo; That report altogether broke down my
self-command, and being anxious about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>ship, I suddenly fell
into a hopeless sea of despondency. So I, though comforted by my
elders, made up my mind to throw away my property and prospects, and I
determined to go to that island to ascertain the truth. Then, though
patronized by the king and loaded with all manner of wealth, I embarked
in a ship on the sea and set out. Then a terrible pirate, in the form
of a cloud, suddenly arose against me as I was pursuing my course, and
discharged at me pattering drops of rain, like showers of arrows. The
contrary wind, which it brought with it, tossed my ship to and fro like
powerful destiny, and at last broke it up. My attendants and my wealth
were whelmed in the sea, but I myself, when I fell into the water, laid
hold of a large spar.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5762src" href=
"#xd27e5762" name="xd27e5762src">3</a> By the help of this, which
seemed like an arm suddenly extended to me by the Creator, I managed to
reach the shore of the sea, being slowly drifted there by the wind. I
climbed up upon it in great affliction, exclaiming against destiny, and
suddenly I found a little gold which had been left by accident in an
out-of-the-way part of the shore. I sold it in a neighbouring village,
and bought with it food and other necessaries, and after purchasing a
couple of garments, I gradually began to get over to a certain extent
the fatigue produced by my immersion in the sea.</p>
<p>Then I wandered about, not knowing my way, separated from my
beloved, and I saw the ground full of <i lang="sa-latn">lingas</i> of
&#346;iva formed of sand. And daughters of hermits were wandering about
among them. And in one place I saw a maiden engaged in worshipping a
<i lang="sa-latn">linga</i>, who was beautiful, although dressed in the
garb of a dweller in the forest. I began to think, &ldquo;This girl is
wonderfully like my beloved. Can she be my beloved herself? But how
comes it, that I am so lucky as to find her here?&rdquo; And while
these thoughts were passing in my mind, my right eye throbbed
frequently, as if with joy,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5773src" href=
"#xd27e5773" name="xd27e5773src">4</a> and told me that it was no other
than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>she. And I said to her, &ldquo;Fair one, you are
fitted to dwell in a palace, how comes it that you are here in the
forest?&rdquo; But she gave me no answer. Then, through fear of being
cursed by a hermit, I stood concealed by a bower of creepers, looking
at her with an eye that could not have enough. And after she had
performed her worship, she went slowly away from the spot, as if
thinking over something, and frequently turned round to look at me with
loving eye. When she had gone out of sight, the whole horizon seemed to
be obscured with darkness as I looked at it, and I was in a strange
state of perturbation like the Brahmany drake at night.</p>
<p>And immediately I beheld the daughter of the hermit M&aacute;tanga,
who appeared unexpectedly. She was in brightness like the sun, subject
to a vow of chastity from her earliest youth, with body emaciated by
penance, she possessed divine insight, and was of auspicious
countenance like Resignation incarnate. She said to me,
&ldquo;Chandras&aacute;ra, call up all your patience and listen. There
is a great merchant in another island named &#346;ikhara. When a lovely
girl was born to him, he was told by a mendicant, his friend, who
possessed supernatural insight, and whose name was
Jinarakshita,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5832src" href="#xd27e5832"
name="xd27e5832src">5</a> &lsquo;You must not give away this maiden
yourself, for she has another mother. You would commit a crime in
giving her away yourself, such is the righteous prescription of the
law.&rsquo; Since the mendicant had told him this, the merchant wished
to give his daughter, when she was of marriageable age, and you asked
her hand, to you, by the agency of her maternal grandfather. Then she
was sent off on a voyage to her maternal grandfather in the island of
Ceylon, but the vessel was wrecked, and she fell into the sea. And as
she was fated not to die, a great wave brought her here like destiny,
and flung her up upon the shore. Just at that time my father, the
hermit M&aacute;tanga, came to the sea to bathe with his disciples, and
saw her almost dead. He, being of compassionate nature, brought her
round, and took her to his hermitage, and entrusted her to me
saying&mdash;&lsquo;Yamun&aacute;, you must cherish this girl.&rsquo;
And because he found her on the shore (<i lang=
"sa-latn">vel&aacute;</i>) of the sea, he called the girl, who was
beloved by all the hermits, Vel&aacute;. And though I have renounced
the world by a vow of perpetual chastity, it still impedes my soul, on
account of my affection for her, in the form of love and tenderness for
offspring. And my mind is grieved, Chandras&aacute;ra, as often as I
look upon her, unmarried, though in the bloom of youth and beauty.
Moreover she was your wife in a former life. So knowing, my son, by the
power of my meditation that you had come here, I have come to meet you.
Now follow me and marry that Vel&aacute;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>whom I will bestow on
you. Let the sufferings, which you have both endured, produce fruits of
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking thus, the saintly woman refreshed me with her voice as with
cloudless rain, and then she took me to the hermitage of her father,
the great hermit M&aacute;tanga. And at her request the hermit bestowed
on me that Vel&aacute;, like the happiness of the kingdom of the
imagination incarnate in bodily form. But one day, as I was living
happily with Vel&aacute;, I commenced a splashing match with her in the
water of a tank. And I and Vel&aacute;, not seeing the hermit
M&aacute;tanga, who had come there to bathe, sprinkled him
inopportunely with some of the water which we threw. That annoyed him,
and he denounced a curse on me and my wife, saying, &ldquo;You shall be
separated, you wicked couple.&rdquo; Then Vel&aacute; clung to his
knees, and asked him with plaintive voice to appoint a period for the
duration of our curse, and he, after thinking, fixed its end as
follows, &ldquo;When thou shalt behold at a distance
Narav&aacute;hanadatta the future mighty emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, who shall beat with a swift elephant a pair of
fleet horses, then thy curse shall be at an end, and thou shalt be
re-united with thy wife.&rdquo; When the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#7771;ishi</i> M&aacute;tanga had said this, he performed
the ceremony of bathing and other ceremonies, and went to
&#346;vetadv&iacute;pa through the air, to visit the shrine of
Vish&#7751;u. And Yamun&aacute; said to me and my wife&mdash;&ldquo;I
give you now that shoe covered with valuable jewels, which a
Vidy&aacute;dhara long ago obtained, when it had slipped off from
&#346;iva&rsquo;s foot, and which I seized in childish sport.&rdquo;
Thereupon Yamun&aacute; also went to &#346;vetadv&iacute;pa. Then I
having obtained my beloved, and being disgusted with dwelling in the
forest, through fear of being separated from my wife, felt a desire to
return to my own country. And setting out for my native land, I reached
the shore of the sea; and finding a trading vessel, I put my wife on
board, and was preparing to go on board myself, when the wind,
conspiring with the hermit&rsquo;s curse, carried off that ship to a
distance. When the ship carried off my wife before my eyes, my whole
nature was stunned by the shock, and distraction seemed to have found
an opening in me, and broke into me and robbed me of consciousness.
Then an ascetic came that way, and seeing me insensible, he
compassionately brought me round and took me to his hermitage. There he
asked me the whole story, and when he found out that it was the
consequence of a curse, and that the curse was to end, he animated me
with resolution to bear up. Then I found an excellent friend, a
merchant, who had escaped from his ship that had foundered in the sea,
and I set out with him in search of my beloved. And supported by the
hope of the termination of the curse, I wandered through many lands and
lasted out many days, until I finally reached this city of
Vai&#347;&aacute;kha, and heard that you, the jewel of the noble family
of the king of Vatsa, had come here. Then I saw you from a distance
beat that pair of swift horses with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>the female elephant,
and the weight of the curse fell from me, and I felt my heart
lightened.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5849src" href="#xd27e5849" name=
"xd27e5849src">6</a> And immediately I saw that dear Vel&aacute; coming
to meet me, whom the good merchants had brought in their ship. Then I
was re-united with my wife, who had with her the jewels bestowed by
Yamun&aacute;, and having by your favour crossed the ocean of
separation, I came here, prince of Vatsa, to pay you my respects, and I
will now set out cheerfully for my native land with my wife.</p>
<p>When that excellent merchant Chandras&aacute;ra, who had
accomplished his object, had gone, after prostrating himself before the
prince, and telling his story, Ruchiradeva, pleased at beholding the
greatness of his guest, was still more obsequious to him. And in
addition to the elephant and the pair of horses, he gave his sister,
making the duty of hospitality an excuse for doing so, to the prince
who was captivated by her beauty. She was a good match for the prince,
and her brother had long desired to bestow her upon him in marriage.
Narav&aacute;hanadatta then took leave of Ruchiradeva, and with his new
wife, the elephant, and the two horses, returned to the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;. And he remained there, gladdening his
father with his presence, living happily with her and his other wives,
of whom Madanamanchuk&aacute; was the chief. <span class=

the plateau of a great hill, a place full of shady trees. And he saw

said, as if talking in his sleep, &ldquo;Where are you, my dear
Madanamanchuk&aacute;? Come and embrace me.&rdquo; When she heard it,
she profited by his suggestion, and assumed the form of his wife, and
embraced him without the restraint of modesty. Then he opened his eyes,
and beholding her in the form of his wife, he said, &ldquo;O how

Then she dismissed all shame, and exhibiting herself in her real shape,
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=

<h3 class="main">Story of the jackal that was turned into an
elephant.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in a certain wood of ascetics a hermit,
named Brahmasiddhi, who possessed by meditation supernatural power, and
near his hermitage there was an old female jackal dwelling in a cave.
One day it was going out to find food, having been unable to find any
for some time on account of bad weather, when a male elephant, furious
on account of its separation from its female, rushed towards it to kill
it. When the hermit saw that, being compassionate as well as endowed
with magical power, he turned the female jackal into a female elephant,
by way of a kindness, to please both. Then the male elephant, beholding
a female, ceased to be furious, and became attached to her, and so she
escaped death. Then, as he was roaming about with the jackal
transformed into a female elephant, he entered a tank full of the mud
produced by the autumn rains, to crop a lotus. He sank in the mud
there, and could not move, but remained motionless, like a mountain
that has fallen owing to its wings having been cut off by the
thunderbolt. When the female elephant, that was before a jackal, saw
the male in this distress, she went off that moment and followed
another male elephant. Then it happened that the elephant&rsquo;s own
mate, that he had lost, came that way in search of her spouse. The
noble creature, seeing her husband sinking in the mud, entered the mud
of the tank in order to join him. At that moment the hermit
Brahmasiddhi came that way with his disciples, and was moved with pity
when he saw that pair. And he bestowed by his power great strength on
his disciples, and made them extricate the male and female from the
mud. Then the hermit went away, and that couple of elephants, having
been delivered both from separation and death, roamed where they
would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, my dear, that even animals, if they are of a
noble strain, do not desert a lord or friend in calamity, but rescue
him from it. But as for those which are of low origin, they are of
fickle nature, and their hearts are never moved by noble feelings or
affection.&rdquo; When the prince of Vatsa said this, the heavenly
maiden said to him&mdash;&ldquo;It is so, there can be no doubt about
this. But I know what your real object is in telling me this tale; so
in return, my husband, hear this tale from me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of V&aacute;madatta and his wicked wife.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an excellent Br&aacute;hman in
K&aacute;nyakubja, named &#346;&uacute;radatta, possessor of a hundred
villages, respected by the king B&aacute;hu&#347;akti. And he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>had a devoted wife, named Vasumat&iacute;, and
by her he begot a handsome son, named V&aacute;madatta.
V&aacute;madatta, the darling of his father, was instructed in all the
sciences, and soon married a wife, of the name of
&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;. In course of time his father went to
heaven, and his wife followed him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5904src"
href="#xd27e5904" name="xd27e5904src">2</a> and the son undertook with
his wife the duties of a householder. But without his knowledge his
wife was addicted to following her lusts, and by some chance or other
she became a witch possessed of magical powers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5907src" href="#xd27e5907" name="xd27e5907src">3</a></p>
<p>One day, when the Br&aacute;hman was in the king&rsquo;s camp,
engaged in his service, his paternal uncle came and said to him in
secret, &ldquo;Nephew, our family is disgraced, for I have seen your
wife in the company of your cowherd.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When V&aacute;madatta heard this, he
left his uncle in the camp in his stead, and went, with his sword for
his only companion, back to his own house. He went into the
flower-garden and remained there in concealment, and in the night the
cowherd came there. And immediately his wife came eagerly to meet her
paramour, with all kinds of food in her hand. After he had eaten, she
went off to bed with him, and then V&aacute;madatta rushed upon them
with uplifted sword, exclaiming, &ldquo;Wretches, where are you
going?&rdquo; When he said that, his wife rose up and said, &ldquo;Away
fool,&rdquo; and threw some dust in his face. Then V&aacute;madatta was
immediately changed from a man into a buffalo, but in his new condition
he still retained his memory. Then his wicked wife put him among the
buffaloes, and made the herdsman beat him with sticks.<a class=

<p>And the cruel woman immediately sold him in his helpless bestial
condition to a trader, who required a buffalo. The trader put a load
upon the man, who found his transformation to a buffalo a sore trial,
and took him to a village near the Ganges. He reflected, &ldquo;A wife
of very bad character that enters unsuspected the house of a confiding
man, is never likely to bring him prosperity, any more than a snake
which gets into the female apartments.&rdquo; While full of these
thoughts, he was sorrowful, with tears gushing from his eyes, moreover
he was reduced to skin and bone by the fatigue of carrying burdens, and
in this state he was beheld by a certain white witch. She knew by her
magic power the whole transaction, and sprinkling him with some charmed
water, she released him from his buffalo condition. And when he had
returned to human form, she took him to her own house, and gave him her
virgin daughter named K&aacute;ntimat&iacute;. And she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>gave
him some charmed mustard-seeds, and said to him; &ldquo;Sprinkle your
wicked former wife with these, and turn her into a mare.&rdquo; Then
V&aacute;madatta, taking with him his new wife, went with the charmed
mustard-seeds to his own house. Then he killed the herdsman, and with
the mustard-seeds he turned<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5925src" href=
"#xd27e5925" name="xd27e5925src">5</a> his former wife into a mare, and
tied her up in the stable. And in order to revenge himself, he made it
a rule to give her every day seven blows with a stick, before he took
any food.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5934src" href="#xd27e5934" name=
"xd27e5934src">6</a></p>
<p>One day, while he was living there in this way with
K&aacute;ntimat&iacute;, a guest came to his house. The guest had just
sat down to his meal, when suddenly V&aacute;madatta got up and rushed
quickly out of the room without eating anything, because he recollected
that he had not beaten his wicked wife with a stick that day. And after
he had given his wife, in the form of a mare, the appointed number of
blows, he came in with his mind easy, and took his food. Then the
guest, being astonished, asked him, out of curiosity, where he had gone
in such a hurry, leaving his food. Thereupon V&aacute;madatta told him
his whole story from the beginning, and his guest said to him,
&ldquo;What is the use of this persistent revenge? Petition that
mother-in-law of yours, who first released you from your animal
condition, and gain some advantage for yourself.&rdquo; When the guest
gave this advice to V&aacute;madatta, he approved it, and the next
morning dismissed him with the usual attentions.</p>
<p>Then that witch, his mother-in-law, suddenly paid him a visit, and
he supplicated her persistently to grant him a boon. The powerful witch
instructed him and his wife in the method of gaining the
life-prolonging charm, with the proper initiatory rites.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5941src" href="#xd27e5941" name="xd27e5941src">7</a>
So he went to the mountain of &#346;r&iacute; and set about obtaining
that charm, and the charm, when obtained, appeared to him in visible
shape, and gave him a splendid sword. And when the successful
V&aacute;madatta had obtained the sword, he and his wife
K&aacute;ntimat&iacute; became glorious Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then he
built by his magic power a splendid city on a peak of the Malaya
mountain, named Rajatak&uacute;&#7789;a. There, in time, that prince
among the Vidy&aacute;dharas had born to him by his queen an auspicious
daughter, named Lalitalochan&aacute;. And the moment she was born, she
was declared by a voice, that came from heaven, to be destined to be
the wife of the future emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, my husband, that I am that very Lalitalochan&aacute;,
and that knowing the facts by my science and being in love with you, I
have brought you to this very Malaya mountain, which is my own
home.&rdquo; When she had in these words told him her story,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta was much pleased, and entertained great respect
for his new wife. And he remained there with her, and immediately the
king of Vatsa and his <i>entourage</i> learnt the truth, by means of
the supernatural knowledge of Ratnaprabh&aacute;, and the other wives
of Narav&aacute;hanadatta that possessed the same powers.</p>

<p class="first">Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having obtained that new
bride Lalitalochan&aacute;, sported with her on that very Malaya
mountain, delightful on account of the first burst of spring, in
various forest purlieus adorned with flowering trees.</p>
<p>And in one grove his beloved, in the course of gathering flowers,
disappeared out of his sight into a dense thicket, and while he was
wandering on, he saw a great tank with clear water, that, on account of
the flowers fallen from the trees on its bank, resembled the heaven
studded with stars.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5960src" href=
"#xd27e5960" name="xd27e5960src">1</a></p>
<p>And he thought&mdash;&ldquo;I will wait until my beloved, who is
gathering flowers, returns to me; and in the meanwhile I will bathe in
this lake and rest for a little upon its bank.&rdquo; So he bathed and
worshipped the gods, and then he sat down on a slab of rock in the
shade of a sandal-wood tree. While sitting there he thought of his
beloved Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who was so far off, beholding the gait
of the female swans that rivalled hers, and hearing the singing of the
female cuckoos in the mango-creepers that equalled hers, and seeing the
eyes of the does that recalled hers to his mind. And as soon as he
recollected her, the fire of love sprang up in his breast, and tortured
him so that he fainted; and at that moment a glorious hermit came there
to bathe, whose name was Pi&#347;angaja&#7789;a. He, seeing the prince
in such a state, sprinkled him with sandal-water, refreshing as the
touch of his beloved. Then he recovered consciousness and bowed before
the hermit. But the hermit said to him, &ldquo;My son, in order that
you may obtain your wish, acquire endurance. For by means of that
quality every thing is acquired, and in order that you may understand
this, come to my hermitage and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"

M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, if you have not already heard it. When the
hermit had said this, he bathed and took the prince to his hermitage,
and quickly performed his daily prayers. And Pi&#347;angaja&#7789;a
entertained him there with fruits, and ate fruits himself, and then he
began to tell him this tale of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta.</p>

<p class="first">There is a city of the name of Ayodhy&aacute; famous
in the three worlds. In it there lived in old time a king named
Amaradatta. He was of resplendent brightness, and he had a wife named
Surataprabh&aacute;, who was as closely knit to him as the oblation to
the fire.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5977src" href="#xd27e5977" name=

"noteref" id="xd27e5983src" href="#xd27e5983" name=

<p>And that young prince had ten ministers of his own,
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti and Sth&uacute;lab&aacute;hu, and
Vikramake&#347;arin, D&#7771;i&#7693;hamush&#7789;i, and Meghabala and
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, and Vimalabuddhi, and Vy&aacute;ghrasena
and Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and the tenth Vichitrakatha. They were all
of good birth, young, brave, and wise, and devoted to their
master&rsquo;s interests. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta led a happy
life with them in his father&rsquo;s house, but he did not obtain a
suitable wife.</p>
<p>And one day his minister Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama said to him in
secret,&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, prince, what happened to me in the night. I
went to sleep last night on the roof of the palace, and I saw in a
dream a lion, with claws terrible as the thunderbolt, rushing upon me.
I rose up, sword in hand, and then the lion began to flee, and I
pursued him at my utmost speed. He crossed a river, and stuck out his
long tongue<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5990src" href="#xd27e5990" name=
"xd27e5990src">5</a> at me, and I cut it off with my sword. And I made
use of it to cross that river, for it was as broad as a bridge. And
thereupon the lion became a deformed giant. I asked him who he was and
the giant said, &lsquo;I am a Vet&aacute;la, and I am delighted with
your courage, my brave fellow.&rsquo; Then I said to him, &lsquo;If
this is the case, then tell me who is to be the wife of my master
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta.&rsquo; When I said this to the
Vet&aacute;la, he answered,&mdash;&lsquo;There is in Ujjayin&iacute; a
king named Karmasena. He has a daughter, who in beauty surpasses the
Apsarases, being, as it were, the receptacle of the Creator&rsquo;s
handiwork in the form of loveliness. Her name is
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, and she shall be his wife, and by
gaining her, he shall become king of the whole earth.&rsquo; When the
Vet&aacute;la <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>had said this, he disappeared, and I came home;
this is what happened to me in the night, my sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <span class="corr" id="xd27e6000" title=
"Source: Mrig&aacute;nkadatta">M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta</span> heard
this from <span class="corr" id="xd27e6003" title=
"Source: Bh&iacute;maparakrama">Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama</span>, he
summoned all his ministers, and had it told to them, and then he said,
&ldquo;Hear, what I too saw in a dream; I thought we all entered a
certain wood; and in it, being thirsty with travelling, we reached with
difficulty some water; and when we wished to drink it, five armed men
rose up and tried to prevent us. We killed them, and then in the
torments of our thirst we again turned to drink the water, but lo!
neither the men nor the water were to be seen. Then we were in a
miserable state; but on a sudden we saw the god &#346;iva come there,
mounted on his bull, resplendent with the moon on his forehead; we bent
before him in prayer and he dropped from his right eye a tear-drop on
the ground. That became a sea, and I drew from it a splendid
pearl-necklace and fastened it round my neck. And I drank up that sea
in a human skull stained with blood. And immediately I awoke, and lo!
the night was at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had described this wonderful sight
that he had seen in his dream, the other ministers rejoiced, but
Vimalabuddhi said; &ldquo;You are fortunate, prince, in that &#346;iva
has shewn you this favour. As you obtained the necklace and drank up
the sea, you shall without fail obtain
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; and rule the whole earth. But the
rest of the dream indicates some slight amount of misfortune.&rdquo;
When Vimalabuddhi had said this, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta again said
to his ministers, &ldquo;Although the fulfilment of my dream will no
doubt come to pass in the way which my friend
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama heard predicted by the Vet&aacute;la,
still I must win from that Karmasena, who confides in his army and his
forts, his daughter &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; by force of
policy. And the force of policy is the best instrument in all
undertakings. Now listen, I will tell you a story to prove
this.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Bhadrab&aacute;hu and his clever
minister.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a king in Magadha, named Bhadrab&aacute;hu.
He had a minister named Mantragupta, most sagacious of men. That king
once said of his own accord to that minister; &ldquo;The king of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e6013" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
named Dharmagopa, has a daughter named Anangal&iacute;l&aacute;, the
chief beauty of the three worlds. I have often asked for her in
marriage, but out of hostility that king will not give her to me. And
he is a formidable foe, on account of his possessing an elephant named
Bhadradanta. Still I cannot bear to live any longer without that
daughter of his. So I have no measure which I can adopt in this
business. Tell me, my friend, what I am to do.&rdquo; When the king
said this, his minister answered him; &ldquo;Why, king, do you suppose
that courage and not policy ensures success? Dismiss your anxiety; I
will manage the matter for you by my own ingenuity.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>So, the next day, the minister set out for <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e6019" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
disguised as a P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic, and he took six or seven
companions with him, who were disguised as his pupils, and they told
all the people, who came together from all quarters to adore him, that
he possessed supernatural powers. Then, as he was roaming about one
night to find out some means of accomplishing his object, he saw in the
distance the wife of the keeper of the elephants leave her house, going
along quickly through fear, escorted in some direction or other by
three or four armed men. He at once said to himself, &ldquo;Surely this
lady is eloping somewhere, so I will see where she is going.&rdquo; So
he followed her with his attendants. And he observed from a distance
the house into which she went, and then he returned to his own lodging.
And the next day, as the elephant-keeper was wandering about in search
of his wife, who had gone off with his wealth, the minister contrived
to send his own followers to meet him. They found that he had just
swallowed poison because he could not find his wife, and they
counteracted by their knowledge the effect of the poison, pretending
that they did it out of pure compassion. And they said to him;
&ldquo;Come to our teacher, for he is a seer and knows every
thing:&rdquo; and so they brought him to the minister. And the
elephant-keeper fell at the feet of the minister, who was rendered more
majestic by the insignia of his vow, and asked him for news of his
wife. The minister pretended to meditate, and after a time told him the
place where she was taken by the strange men at night, with all the
signs by which he might recognise it. Then the elephant-keeper bowed
again before him, and went with a host of policemen and surrounded that
place. And he killed those wicked men who had carried off his wife, and
recovered her, together with her ornaments and his wealth.</p>
<p>And the next day he went and bowed before, and praised that supposed
seer, and invited him to an entertainment. And as the minister did not
wish to enter a house, and said that he must eat at night, he made an
entertainment for him at nightfall in the elephant-stables. So the
minister went there and feasted with his followers, taking with him a
concealed serpent, that he had by means of a charm got to enter the
hollow of a bamboo. Then the elephant-keeper went away, and while the
others were asleep, the minister introduced, by means of the bamboo,
the serpent into the ear of the elephant Bhadradanta, while it was
asleep, and he spent the night there, and in the morning went back to
Magadha his native land; but the elephant died from the bite of the
snake.</p>
<p>When the clever minister returned, having smitten down the elephant
as if it were the pride of that king Dharmagopa, the king
Bhadrab&aacute;hu was in ecstasies. Then he sent off an ambassador to
<span class="corr" id="xd27e6026" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>
to ask for the hand of Anangal&iacute;l&aacute;. The king, who was
helpless from the loss of his elephant, gave her to him; for kings, who
know times and seasons, bend like canes, if it is expedient to do so.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So, by the sagacity of that minister Mantragupta, the king
Bhadrab&aacute;hu obtained Anangal&iacute;l&aacute;. And in the same
way I must obtain that wife by wisdom.&rdquo; When
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta said this, his minister Vichitrakatha said
to him&mdash;&ldquo;You will succeed in all by the favour of &#346;iva
which was promised you in a dream. What will not the effective favour
of the gods accomplish? Hear in proof of it the story I am now going to
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in the city of Taksha&#347;il&aacute; a king
of the name of Bhadr&aacute;ksha. He, desiring a son, was worshipping
Lakshm&iacute; every day with one hundred and eight white lotuses upon
a sword. One day, as the king was worshipping her without breaking
silence, he happened to count the lotuses mentally, and found that
there was one missing. He then gave the goddess the lotus of his heart
spitted on the sword, and she was pleased and granted him a boon that
would ensure his having a son that would rule the whole earth. And she
healed the wound of the king and disappeared. Then there was born a son
to the king by his queen, and he possessed all the auspicious marks.
And the king called him Pushkar&aacute;ksha, because he obtained him by
the gift of the lotus of his heart. And when the son, in course of
time, grew up to manhood, Bhadr&aacute;ksha anointed him king, as he
possessed great virtues, and himself repaired to the forest.</p>
<p>Pushkar&aacute;ksha, for his part, having obtained the kingdom, kept
worshipping &#346;iva every day, and one day at the end of his worship,
he asked him to bestow on him a wife. Then he heard a voice come from
heaven, saying, &ldquo;My son, thou shalt obtain all thy desire.&rdquo;
Then he remained in a happy state, as he had now a good hope of
success. And it happened that one day he went to a wood inhabited by
wild beasts, to amuse himself with hunting. There he saw a camel about
to eat two snakes entwined together, and in his grief he killed the
camel. The camel immediately became a Vidy&aacute;dhara, abandoning its
camel body, and being pleased said to Pushkar&aacute;ksha &ldquo;You
have done me a benefit. So hear what I have to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is, king, a mighty Vidy&aacute;dhara named
Rankum&aacute;lin. And a beautiful maiden of the Vidy&aacute;dhara
race, named T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute;, who admired good looks, saw
him and fell in love with him, and chose him for her husband. And then
her father, angry because they had married without consulting anything
but their own inclination, laid on them a curse that would separate
them for some time. Then the couple, T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; and
Rankum&aacute;lin, sported, with ever-growing love, in various regions
belonging to them.</p>
<p>But one day, in consequence of that curse, they lost sight of one
another in a wood, and were separated. Then
T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute;, in her search for her husband, at last
reached a forest on the other side of the western sea, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>inhabited by a hermit of supernatural powers.
There she saw a large <i lang="sa-latn">jambu</i>-tree in flower, which
seemed compassionately to console her with the sweet buzzing of its
bees. And she took the form of a bee, and sat down on it to rest, and
began to drink the honey of a flower. And immediately she saw her
husband, from whom she had been so long separated, come there, and she
bedewed that flower with a tear of joy. And she abandoned the body of a
bee, and went and united herself to her husband Rankum&aacute;lin, who
had come there in search of her, as the moonlight is united to the
moon.</p>
<p>Then she went with him to his home: but from the <i lang=
"sa-latn">jambu</i>-flower bedewed with her tear a fruit was
produced.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6062src" href="#xd27e6062" name=

the fruit. Now once on a time the hermit, who was named
Vijit&aacute;su, was wandering about in search of fruits and roots, and
came there, and that fruit, being ripe, fell from the <i lang=
"sa-latn">jambu</i>-tree and broke, and a heavenly maiden came out of
it, and respectfully bowing, saluted the feet of that hermit. That
hermit, who possessed divine insight, when he beheld her, at once knew
her true history, and being astonished, took her to his hermitage, and
gave her the name of Vinayavat&iacute;. Then in course of time she grew
up to womanhood in his hermitage, and I, as I was roaming in the air,
saw her, and being infatuated by pride in my own good looks and by
love, I went to her, and tried to carry her off by force against her
will. At that moment the hermit <span class="corr" id="xd27e6089"

cries, came in, and denounced this curse upon me, &ldquo;O thou whose
whole body is full of pride in thy beauty, become an ugly camel. But
when thou shalt be slain by king Pushkar&aacute;ksha, thou shalt be
released from thy curse. And he shall be the husband of this
Vinayavat&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When cursed in these words by the hermit I became a camel on
this earth, and now, thanks to you, my curse is at an end; so go to
that forest on the other side of the western sea, named
Surabhim&aacute;ruta, and obtain for a wife that heavenly creature, who
would make &#346;r&iacute; herself lose all pride in her own
beauty.&rdquo; When the heavenly Vidy&aacute;dhara had said this to
Pushkar&aacute;ksha, he flew up to the sky. Then Pushkar&aacute;ksha
returned to his city, and entrusted his kingdom to his ministers, and
mounting his horse, went <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>off alone at night. And at last he
reached the shore of the western sea, and there he reflected,
&ldquo;How shall I cross over this sea?&rdquo; Then he saw there an
empty temple of Durg&aacute;, and he entered it, and bathed, and
worshipped the goddess. And he found there a lyre, which had been
deposited there by some one, and he devoutly sang to it in honour of
the goddess songs composed by himself. And then he lay down to sleep
there. And the goddess was so pleased with his lyric worship, that in
the night she had him conveyed across the sea by her attendant demons,
while he was asleep.</p>
<p>Then he woke up in the morning on the other side of the sea, and saw
himself no longer in the temple of Durg&aacute;, but in a wood. And he
rose up in astonishment, and wandered about, and beheld a hermitage,
which seemed to bow before him hospitably by means of its trees weighed
down with fruit, and to utter a welcome with the music of its birds. So
he entered it, and saw a hermit surrounded by his pupils. And the king
approached the hermit, and bowed at his feet. The hermit, who possessed
supernatural insight, received him hospitably and said to him;
&ldquo;King Pushkar&aacute;ksha, Vinayavat&iacute;, for whom you have
come, has gone out for a moment to fetch firewood, so wait a little:
you shall to-day marry her who was your wife in a former life.&rdquo;
Then Pushkar&aacute;ksha said to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Bravo! this is
that very hermit Vijit&aacute;su, and this is that very wood, no doubt
the goddess has had me carried across the ocean. But this that the
hermit tells me is strange, that she was my wife in a previous state of
existence.&rdquo; Then he asked the hermit in his joy the following
question, &ldquo;Tell me, reverend sir, how was she my wife
before?&rdquo; Then the hermit said, &ldquo;Listen, if you feel curious
on the point.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in old time a merchant in
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, named Dharmasena, and he had a beautiful wife
named Vidyullekh&aacute;. As it happened, he was robbed by bandits and
wounded with weapons by them, and longing for death, he went out with
his wife to enter the fire. And the two saw suddenly a beautiful couple
of swans coming through the air. Then they entered the fire, and died
with their minds fixed on those swans, and so the husband and wife were
born in the next birth as swans.</p>
<p>Now, one day in the rains, as they were in their nest in a
date-palm-tree, a storm uprooted the tree and separated them. The next
day the storm was at an end, and the male swan went to look for his
female, but he could not find her in the lakes or in any quarter of the
sky. At last he went, distracted with love, to the M&aacute;nasa lake,
the proper place for swans at that season of the year, and another
female swan, that he met on the way, gave him hopes that he would find
her there. There he found his female, and he spent the rainy season
there, and then he went to a mountain-peak <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>to
enjoy himself with her. There his female was shot by a fowler; when he
saw that, he flew away distracted with fear and grief. The fowler went
off, taking with him the dead female swan, and on the way he saw many
armed men at a distance, coming towards him, and he thought that they
would perhaps take the bird from him, so he cut some grass with his
knife, and covering up the bird with that, left her on the ground.
After the men had gone, the fowler returned to take the female swan.
But it happened that among the grass which he had cut was a herb, which
possessed the power of raising the dead to life. By means of the juice
of this herb the female swan was restored to life,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6110src" href="#xd27e6110" name="xd27e6110src">7</a> and
before his eyes she flung off the grass, and flew up into the sky, and
disappeared.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile the male swan went and settled on the shore of
a lake among a flock of swans, distracted with grief at seeing his mate
in this state.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6129src" href="#xd27e6129"
name="xd27e6129src">8</a> Immediately a certain fisherman threw a net,
and caught all those birds, and thereupon sat down to take his food.
Then the female swan came there in search of her husband, and found him
caught in the net, and in her grief she cast her eyes in every
direction. Then she saw on the bank of the lake a necklace of gems,
which a certain person, who had gone into the water to bathe, had laid
on top of his clothes. She went and carried off the necklace without
that person seeing her do it, and she flew gently through the air past
the fisherman, to shew him the necklace. The fisherman, when he saw the
female swan with the necklace in her beak, left the net full of birds,
and ran after her, stick in hand. But the female swan deposited the
necklace upon the top of a distant rock, and the fisherman proceeded to
climb up the rock to get the necklace. When the female swan saw that,
she went and struck in the eye with her beak a monkey that was asleep
on a tree, near where her husband lay caught in the net. The monkey,
being terrified by the blow, fell on the net and tore it, and so all
the swans escaped from it. Then the couple of swans were re-united, and
they told one another their adventures, and in their joy amused
themselves as they would. The fisherman, after getting the necklace,
came back to fetch the birds, and the man whose necklace had been taken
away, met him as he was looking for it, and as the fact of the
fisherman&rsquo;s being in possession of the necklace was revealed by
his fear, he recovered it from him and cut off his right hand with his
sword. And the two swans, sheltering themselves under one lotus by way
of umbrella, rose up in the middle of the day from the lake and roamed
in the sky.</p>
<p>And soon the two birds reached the bank of a river haunted by a
certain hermit, who was employed in worshipping &#346;iva. Then the
couple of swans were shot through with one arrow by a fowler, as they
were flying along, and fell together to the earth. And the lotus, which
they had used <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>as an umbrella, fell on the top of a <i lang=
"sa-latn">linga</i> of &#346;iva, while the hermit was engaged in
worship. Then the fowler, seeing them, took the male swan for himself,
and gave the female swan to the hermit, who offered it to
&#346;iva.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6142src" href="#xd27e6142" name=
"xd27e6142src">9</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you, Pushkar&aacute;ksha, were that very male swan; and
by the virtue of that lotus, which fell on the top of the <i lang=
"sa-latn">linga</i>, you have been now born in a royal family. And that
female swan has been born in a family of Vidy&aacute;dharas as
Vinayavat&iacute;, for &#346;iva was abundantly worshipped with her
flesh. Thus Vinayavat&iacute; was your wife in a former birth.&rdquo;
When the hermit Vijit&aacute;su said this to Pushkar&aacute;ksha, the
king asked him another question; How comes it, hermit, that the
entering the fire, which atones for a multitude of sins, produced in
our case the fruit of birth in the nature of a bird? Thereupon the
hermit replied, &ldquo;A creature receives the form of that which it
was contemplating at the moment of death.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of L&aacute;va&#7751;yamanjar&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For there was in the city of Ujjayin&iacute; a holy
Br&aacute;hman virgin of the name of
L&aacute;va&#7751;yamanjar&iacute;, who observed a vow of perpetual
chastity; she once saw a Br&aacute;hman youth of the name of
Kamalodaya, and her mind was suddenly attracted to him, and she was
consumed with the fire of love but she did not abandon her vow. She
went to the shore of the Gandhavat&iacute;, and abandoned her life in a
holy place, with her thoughts intently fixed on his love.</p>
<p>But on account of that intent meditation she was born in the next
birth as a <i>het&aelig;ra</i>, of the name of R&uacute;pavat&iacute;,
in a town named Ekalavy&aacute;. However, owing to the virtue of her
vow and of the holy bathing-place, she remembered her former birth, and
in conversation she related that secret of her former birth to a
Br&aacute;hman named Cho&#7693;akar&#7751;a, who was always engaged in
muttering prayers, in order to cure him of his exclusive devotion to
muttering, and at last, though she was a <i>het&aelig;ra</i>, as her
will was purified she attained blessedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, king, you see that a person attains similarity to that
which he thinks of. Having said this to the king, the hermit dismissed
him to bathe, and he himself performed his midday ablutions<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the king Pushkar&aacute;ksha went to the bank of the river, that
flowed through the forest, and saw Vinayavat&iacute; there gathering
flowers. Her body gleamed as if she were the light of the sun, come to
visit the wood out of curiosity, as it had never been able to penetrate
its thickets. He thought to himself, &ldquo;Who can this be?&rdquo; And
she, as she was sitting in conversation with her maid, said to her;
&ldquo;My friend, the Vidy&aacute;dhara, who wished long ago to carry
me off, came here to-day released from his curse, and announced the
arrival of my husband.&rdquo; When the friend heard that, she answered
the hermit-maiden; &ldquo;It is true, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>this morning the
hermit Vijit&aacute;su said to his pupil Munjake&#347;a; &lsquo;Go and
bring here quickly T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; and Rankum&aacute;lin,
for to-day will certainly take place the marriage of their daughter
Vinayavat&iacute; to king Pushkar&aacute;ksha.&rsquo; When
Munjake&#347;a received this order from his teacher, he said, &lsquo;I
obey,&rsquo; and started on his journey. So come, my friend, let us now
go to the hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, Vinayavat&iacute; departed, and
Pushkar&aacute;ksha heard the whole conversation from a distance
without being seen. And the king returned quickly to the hermitage of
Vijit&aacute;su, after he had plunged in the river, as if to cool the
burning heat of love. There T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; and
Rankum&aacute;lin, who had arrived, honoured him when he bent before
them, and the hermits gathered round him. Then, on an altar-platform
illuminated by the great hermit Vijit&aacute;su with his austerities,
as if by a second fire in human form, Rankum&aacute;lin gave that
Vinayavat&iacute; to the king, and he bestowed on him at the same time
a heavenly chariot, that would travel in the sky. And the great hermit
Vijit&aacute;su conferred on him this boon; &ldquo;Rule, together with
her, the earth with its four seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the permission of the hermit, the king
Pushkar&aacute;ksha took his new wife with him, and mounted that
heavenly chariot that travelled through the air, and, crossing the sea,
went quickly to his own city, being like the rising of the moon to the
eyes of his subjects.</p>
<p>And then he conquered the earth and became emperor of it by virtue
of his chariot, and lived a long time in enjoyment with
Vinayavat&iacute; in his own capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So a task, which is very difficult in itself, succeeds in
this world, if the gods are propitious, and so, king, you may be
certain that your enterprise also will succeed soon by the favour of
the god &#346;iva, promised you in a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had heard this romantic story from
his minister, being very eager to obtain
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, he made up his mind to go to
Ujjayin&iacute; with his ministers.</p>

<p class="first">Accordingly M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, being desirous
to obtain &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; the daughter of king
Karmasena, who had been described by the Vet&aacute;la, planned with
his ministers to leave his city secretly, disguised as a
P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic, in order to travel to Ujjayin&iacute;.
And the prince himself directed his minister
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama to bring the necessary staves like
bed-posts, the skulls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>and so on. And the head minister
of the king his father found out, by means of a spy, that <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e6189" title=
"Source: Bh&iacute;maparakrama">Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama</span> had
collected all these things in his house. And at that time it happened
that M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, while walking about on the top of his
palace, spit down some betel-juice. And as ill-luck would have it, it
fell on the head of his father&rsquo;s minister, who happened to be
walking below, unseen by the prince.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6192src" href="#xd27e6192" name="xd27e6192src">1</a> But the
minister, knowing that M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had spit down that
betel-juice, bathed, and laid up in his heart a grudge against
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta on account of the insult.</p>
<p>Now it happened that the next day king Amaradatta, the father of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, had an attack of cholera, and then the
minister saw his chance, and, after imploring an assurance of safety,
he said in secret to the king, who was tortured with his sudden attack
of disease, &ldquo;The fact is, my sovereign, your son
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta has begun incantations against you in the
house of Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, that is why you are suffering. I
found it out by means of a spy, and the thing is obvious for all to
see, so banish your son from your realm and your disease from your body
at the same time.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he was terrified,
and sent his own general to the house of Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama,
to investigate the matter. And he found the hair, and the skulls, and
other articles,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6197src" href="#xd27e6197"
name="xd27e6197src">2</a> and immediately brought those very things and
shewed them to the king. And the king in his anger said to the general,
&ldquo;That son of mine is conspiring against me, because he wishes to
reign himself, so expel him from the kingdom this very moment without
delay, together with his ministers.&rdquo; For a confiding<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6209src" href="#xd27e6209" name="xd27e6209src">3</a>
king never sees through the wicked practices of his ministers. So the
general went and communicated that order of the king&rsquo;s, and
expelled M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta from the city, together with his
ministers.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6224src" href="#xd27e6224" name=
"xd27e6224src">4</a></p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was delighted at having obtained his
object, and he worshipped Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and mentally took a humble
leave of his parents, and started off. And after they had gone a great
distance from the town of Ayodhy&aacute;, the prince said to
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti and the other nine ministers who were
travelling with him, &ldquo;There is here a great king of the
Kir&aacute;tas, named &#346;aktirakshita; he is a student in the
sciences, observing a vow of chastity, and he is a friend of mine from
childhood. For, when his father was long ago captured in battle, he
sent him here to be imprisoned as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>substitute for
himself, in order to obtain his own release. And when his father died,
his relations by the father&rsquo;s side rose against him, and at my
instigation my father established him on the throne of his father with
a military force. So let us go to him, my friends, and then we will
travel on to Ujjayin&iacute;, to find that
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, all the ministers exclaimed, &ldquo;So be
it,&rdquo; and he set out with them and reached in the evening a great
wilderness. It was devoid of trees and water, and it was with
difficulty that at last he found a tank, with one withered tree growing
upon its banks. There he performed the evening ceremonies, and drank
water, and being fatigued, he went to sleep with his ministers under
that dry tree. And in the night, which was illuminated by the moon, he
woke up, and saw that the tree first put forth abundance of leaves,
then of flowers, then of fruit. And when he saw its ripe fruit falling,
he immediately woke up his ministers, and pointed out that marvel to
them. Then they were astonished, and as they were hungry, he and they
ate the delicious fruits of that tree together, and after they had
eaten them, the dry tree suddenly became a young Br&aacute;hman, before
the eyes of them all. And when M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta questioned
him, he told his tale in the following words.</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of &#346;rutadhi.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an excellent Br&aacute;hman in
Ayodhy&aacute; named D&aacute;madhi. I am his son, and my name is
&#346;rutadhi. And once in a time of famine he was wandering about with
me, and he reached this place almost dead. Here he got five fruits
which some one gave him, and though he was exhausted with hunger, he
gave three to me, and set aside two for himself. Then he went into the
water of the lake to bathe, and in the meanwhile I ate all the five
fruits, and pretended to be asleep. He returned after bathing, and
beholding me cunningly lying here as motionless as a log, he cursed me,
saving, &ldquo;Become a dry tree here on the bank of the lake. And on
moonlight nights flowers and fruit shall spring from you, and when once
on a time you shall have refreshed guests with fruits, you shall be
delivered from your curse.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6238src"
href="#xd27e6238" name="xd27e6238src">5</a> As soon as my father had
pronounced this curse on me, I became a dry tree, but now that you have
tasted my fruit, I have been delivered from the curse, after enduring
it for a long time.</p>
<p>After &#346;rutadhi had related his own history, he asked
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta for his, and he told it him. Then
&#346;rutadhi, who had no relations, and was well-read in policy, asked
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta to permit him, as a favour, to attach
himself to his service. So, after he had spent the night in this way,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta set out next morning with his ministers. And
in the course of his journey he came to a forest named
Karima&#7751;&#7693;ita. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149"
href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>he saw five wild looking men
with long hair, who aroused his wonder. Then the five men came and
respectfully addressed him as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were born in the city of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; as
Br&aacute;hmans who lived by keeping cows. And during a famine we came
from that country, where the grass was scorched by drought, with our
cows, to this wood which abounds in grass. And here we found an elixir
in the form of the water of a tank, continually flavoured with the
three kinds of fruits<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6264src" href=
"#xd27e6264" name="xd27e6264src">6</a> that drop from the trees growing
on its bank. And five hundred years have passed over our heads in this
uninhabited wood, while we have been drinking this water and the milk
of cows. It is thus, prince, that we have become such as you see, and
now destiny has sent you to us as guests, so come to our
hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When thus invited by them, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta went with them
to their hermitage, taking his companions with him, and spent the day
there living on milk. And he set out from it in the morning, and in
course of time he reached the country of the Kir&aacute;tas, seeing
other wonderful sights on the way. And he sent on &#346;rutadhi to
inform his friend &#346;aktirakshita, the king of the Kir&aacute;tas,
of his arrival. When the sovereign of the Kir&aacute;tas heard of it,
he went to meet M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta with great courtesy, and
conducted him with his ministers into his city.
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta told him the cause of his arrival, and
remained there for some days, being entertained by him. And the prince
arranged that &#346;aktirakshita should be ready to assist him in his
undertaking when the proper time came, and then he set out, on an
auspicious day, for Ujjayin&iacute;, with his eleven companions, having
been captivated by &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.</p>
<p>And as he went along, he reached an uninhabited forest and saw
standing under a tree an ascetic, with ashes on his body, a deer-skin,
and matted hair. So he went up to him, with his followers, and said to
him; &ldquo;Reverend sir, why do you live alone in this forest in which
there is no hermitage?&rdquo; Then the hermit answered him, &ldquo;I am
a pupil of the great sage named &#346;uddhak&iacute;rti and I know
innumerable spells. Once on a time I got hold of a certain Kshatriya
boy with auspicious marks, and I exerted all my diligence to cause him
to be possessed, while alive, by a spirit, and, when the boy was
possessed, I questioned him, and he told me of many places for potent
drugs and liquors, and then said this; &lsquo;There is in this Vindhya
forest in the northern quarter a solitary <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree, and under it there is a great palace of
a snake-king.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6279src" href="#xd27e6279"
name="xd27e6279src">7</a> In the middle of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>day
its water is concealed with moistened dust, but it can be discovered by
the couples of swans sporting there together with the
water-cranes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6299src" href="#xd27e6299"
name="xd27e6299src">8</a> There dwells a mighty chief of the snakes,
named P&aacute;r&aacute;vat&aacute;ksha, and he obtained a matchless
sword from the war of the gods and Asuras, named
Vaid&uacute;ryak&aacute;nti; whatever man obtains that sword will
become a chief of the Siddhas and roam about unconquered, and that
sword can only be obtained by the aid of heroes.&rsquo; When the
possessed boy had said this, I dismissed him. So I have wandered about
over the earth desirous to obtain that sword, and caring for nothing
else, but, as I have not been able to find men to help me, in disgust I
have come here to die.&rdquo; When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta heard the
ascetic say this, he said to him, &ldquo;I and my ministers will help
you.&rdquo; The ascetic gladly accepted his offer, and went with him
and his followers, by the help of an ointment rubbed on the feet, to
the dwelling-place of that snake. There he found the sign by which it
could be recognised, and he placed there at night
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and his companions, duly initiated, fixed
with spells; and throwing enchanted mustard-seed he cleared the water
from dust, and began to offer an oblation with snake-subduing spells.
And he conquered by the power of his spells the impediments, such as
earthquakes, clouds, and so on. Then there came out from that <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree a heavenly nymph, as it were, murmuring
spells with the tinkling of her jewelled ornaments, and approaching the
ascetic she pierced his soul with a sidelong glance of love. And then
the ascetic lost his self-command and forgot his spells; and the
shapely fair one, embracing him, flung from his hand the vessel of
oblation. And then the snake P&aacute;r&aacute;vat&aacute;ksha had
gained his opportunity, and he came out from that palace like the dense
cloud of the day of doom. Then the heavenly nymph vanished, and the
ascetic beholding the snake terrible with flaming eyes, roaring
horribly, died of a broken heart.</p>
<p>When he was destroyed, the snake laid aside his awful form, and
cursed M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and his followers, for helping the
ascetic, in the following words, &ldquo;Since you did what was quite
unnecessary after all coming here with this man, you shall be for a
certain time separated from one another.&rdquo; Then the snake
disappeared, and all of them at the same time had their eyes dimmed
with darkness, and were deprived of the power of hearing sounds. And
they immediately went in different directions, separated from one
another by the power of the curse, though they kept looking for one
another and calling to one another. And when the delusion of the night
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>was at an end, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta found
himself roaming about in the wood without his ministers.</p>
<p>And, after two or three months had passed, the Br&aacute;hman
&#346;rutadhi, who was looking for him, suddenly fell in with him.
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta received him kindly, and asked for news of
his ministers, whereupon &#346;rutadhi fell at his feet weeping, and
consoled him, and said to him, &ldquo;I have not seen them, prince, but
I know they will go to Ujjayin&iacute;, for that is the place we all
have to go to.&rdquo; With these and similar speeches he urged the
prince to go there, so M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta set out with him
slowly for Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>And after he had journeyed a few days, he found his own minister
Vimalabuddhi who suddenly came that way. When the minister saw him, he
bowed before him with eyes filled with tears at seeing him, and the
prince embraced him, and making him sit down, he asked him for tidings
of the other ministers. Then Vimalabuddhi said to that prince, who was
so beloved by his servants, &ldquo;I do not know, king, where each of
them has gone in consequence of the curse of the snake. But hear how I
know that you will find them again.&rdquo;</p>

from the prince.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the snake cursed me, I was carried far away by
the curse, and wandered in the eastern part of the forest. And being
fatigued, I was taken by a certain kind person to the hermitage of a
certain hermit, named Brahmada&#7751;&#7693;in. There my fatigue was
removed by the fruits and water which the sage gave me, and, roaming
away far from the hermitage, I saw a vast cave. I entered it out of
curiosity, and I saw inside it a palace made of jewels, and I began to
look into the palace through the lattice-windows. And lo! there was in
it a woman causing to revolve a wheel with bees, and those bees made
some of them for a bull, and others for a donkey, both which creatures
were standing there. And some drank the foam of milk sent forth by the
bull, and others the foam of blood sent forth by the donkey, and became
white and black, according to the colour of the two objects on which
they settled; and then they all turned into spiders. And the spiders,
which were of two different colours, made two different-coloured webs
with their excrements. And one set of webs was hung on wholesome
flowers, and the other on poisonous flowers. And the spiders, that were
clinging to those webs as they pleased, were bitten by a great snake
which came there, having two mouths, one white, and the other black.
Then the woman put them in various pitchers, but they got out again,
and began to occupy the same webs again respectively. Then those, that
were on the webs attached to the poisonous flowers, began to cry out,
owing to the violence of the poison. And thereupon the others, that
were on the other webs, began to cry out also. But the noise
interrupted the meditation of a certain merciful ascetic who was there,
who discharged fire at the webs. Then the webs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>in
which the spiders were entangled, were burnt up, and the spiders
entered a hollow coral rod, and disappeared in a gleaming light at the
top of it. In the meanwhile the woman disappeared with her wheel, her
bull, and her donkey.</p>
<p>When I had seen this, I continued to roam about there in a state of
astonishment; and then I saw a charming lake, which seemed by means of
its lotuses, round which bees hummed, to summon me thither to look at
it. And while I sat on the bank and looked at it, I beheld a great wood
inside the water, and in the wood was a hunter, and the hunter had got
hold of a lion&rsquo;s cub with ten arms which he brought up, and then
banished from the wood in anger, on the ground that it was
disobedient.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6331src" href="#xd27e6331"
name="xd27e6331src">9</a> The lion then heard the voice of a lioness in
a neighbouring wood, and was going in the direction of the sound, when
his ten arms were scattered by a whirlwind. Then a man with a
protuberant belly came and restored his arms as they were before, and
he went to that forest in search of the lioness. He endured for her
sake much hardship in that other forest, and at last obtained her whom
he had had for a wife in a former state, and with her returned to his
own forest. And when the hunter saw that lion return with his mate to
the forest, which was his hereditary abode,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6339src" href="#xd27e6339" name="xd27e6339src">10</a> he resigned
it to him and departed.</p>
<p>When I had seen this, I returned to the hermitage and described both
those very wonderful spectacles to Brahmada&#7751;&#7693;in. And that
hermit, who knows the past, present, and future, kindly said to me,
&ldquo;You are fortunate; &#346;iva has shewn you all this by way of
favour. That woman, whom you saw, is Illusion, and the wheel which she
caused to revolve, is the wheel of mundane existence, and the bees are
living creatures. And the bull and the donkey are respectively symbols
of Righteousness and Unrighteousness, and the foam of milk and the foam
of blood discharged by them, to which the bees repaired, are typical of
good and evil actions. And they acquired properties arising from the
things on which they respectively settled, and became spiders of two
kinds, white and foul respectively; and then with their energy, which
was symbolized by excrement, they produced entangling nets of two
kinds, such as offspring and so on, which were attached to wholesome
and poisonous flowers, which signify happiness and misery. And while
clinging each to its own web, they were bitten by a snake, typical of
Death, with its two mouths, the white set with the white mouth
symbolical of good fortune, the other with the black mouth symbolical
of evil fortune.</p>
<p>Then that female, typifying Illusion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6349src" href="#xd27e6349" name="xd27e6349src">11</a> plunged
them into various wombs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>typified by the jars, and they
again emerged from them, and assuming forms white and black,
corresponding to what they had before, they fell into entangling webs,
which are symbolical of sons and other worldly connexions, resulting in
happiness and misery. Then the black spiders, entangled in their webs,
being tortured by the poison, symbolical of pain, began in their
affliction to invoke the supreme lord as their help. When the white
spiders, who were in their own webs, perceived that, they also became
averse to their state, and began to invoke that same lord. Then the
god, who was present in the form of an ascetic, awoke from his trance,
and consumed all their entangling webs with the fire of knowledge.
Accordingly they ascended into the bright coral tube, typical of the
orb of the sun, and reached the highest home, which lies above it. And
then Illusion vanished, with the revolving wheel of births, and with
her ox, and her ass, typical of Righteousness and Unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Even thus in the circle of existence revolve creatures, fair and
foul according to their actions, and they are liberated by propitiating
&#346;iva; and this spectacle has been shown to you by &#346;iva to
teach you this lesson, and to put an end to your delusion. As for that
sight which you saw in the water of the tank, this is the explanation
of it. The holy god produced this apparent reflection in the water, in
order to teach you what was destined to befall
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta. For he may be compared to a young
lion-whelp, and he was brought up with ten ministers round him
resembling ten arms, and he was banished in anger by his father,
(typified by the hunter) from his native land, typified by the forest:
and on hearing the report of <span class="corr" id="xd27e6358" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>,
(who may be compared to a lioness,) coming from the land of Avanti,
(symbolized by the other wood,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6361src"
href="#xd27e6361" name="xd27e6361src">12</a>) he made towards her, and
the wind which stripped him of his arms is the curse of the snake,
which separated him from his ministers. Then Vin&aacute;yaka<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6370src" href="#xd27e6370" name=
"xd27e6370src">13</a> appeared as a man with a pendulous belly, and
restored to him his arms, (that is to say, his ministers,) and so he
recovered his former condition. Then he went and after enduring great
hardship, obtained from another place the lioness, (that is
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;,) and returned. And when the
hunter, (that is his father,) saw him coming near with his wife, having
swept away the obstacles which his foes put in his way,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6378src" href="#xd27e6378" name=
"xd27e6378src">14</a> he resigned to him the whole of his forest, (that
is his kingdom,) and retired to a grove of ascetics. Thus has &#346;iva
shewn you the future as if it had already taken place. So you may be
sure, your master will recover you, his ministers, and obtain his wife
and his kingdom.&rdquo; When the excellent hermit had thus instructed
me, I recovered hope and left that hermitage, and travelling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>along slowly I have met you here, prince,
to-day. So you may rest assured, prince, that you will recover
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti, and your other ministers, and gain
your object; you certainly gained the favour of Ga&#7751;e&#347;a by
worshipping him before you set out.</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had listened for a while to this
strange story of Vimalabuddhi&rsquo;s, he was much pleased, and after
he had again deliberated with him, he set out for the city of Avanti,
with the double object of accomplishing his enterprise and recovering
his other ministers.</p>

<p class="first">Then, as M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was journeying to
Ujjayin&iacute;, with &#346;rutadhi and Vimalabuddhi, to find
<span class="corr" id="xd27e6390" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>,
he reached the Narmad&aacute; which lay in his path. The fickle stream,
when she beheld him, shook her waves like twining arms, and gleamed
white with laughing foam, as if she were dancing and smiling because he
had so fortunately been reunited with his ministers. And when he had
gone down into the bed of the river to bathe, it happened that a king
of the &#346;avaras, named M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, came there for
the same purpose. When he had bathed, three water-genii<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6393src" href="#xd27e6393" name="xd27e6393src">1</a>
rose up at the same time and seized the Bhilla, whose retinue fled in
terror. When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta saw that, he went into the
water with his sword drawn, and killed those water-genii, and delivered
that king of the Bhillas. When the king of the Bhillas was delivered
from the danger of those monsters, he came up out of the water and fell
at the feet of the prince, and said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Who are you,
that Providence has brought here to save my life on the present
occasion? Of what virtuous father do you adorn the family? And what is
that country favoured by fortune to which you are going?&rdquo; When he
said this, &#346;rutadhi told him the prince&rsquo;s whole story from
the beginning, and then the &#346;avara king shewed him exceeding
respect, and said to him; &ldquo;Then I will be your ally in this
undertaking which you have in view, as you were directed by the god,
and with me will come my friend Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha the king of
M&aacute;tangas. So do me the favour, my lord, of coming to my palace,
since I am your slave.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus he entreated M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta with various humble
speeches, and then took him to his own village. And there he
entertained the prince fittingly with all the luxuries he could
command, and all the people of the village shewed him respect. And the
king of the M&aacute;tangas came and honoured him as the saviour of his
friend&rsquo;s life, and placed his head on the ground to shew that he
was his slave. Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta remained there some
days, to please that M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, the king of the
Bhillas.</p>
<p>And one day, while he was staying there, that king of the
&#346;avaras began to gamble with Cha&#7751;&#7693;aketu his own
warder. And while he was playing, the clouds began to roar, and the
domestic peacocks lifted up their heads and began to dance, and king
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u rose up to look at them. Then the warder,
who was an enthusiastic gambler, said to his sovereign, &ldquo;What is
the use, my master, of looking at these peacocks which are not skilled
in dancing? I have a peacock in my house, to which you would not find
an equal in the world. I will show it you to-morrow, if you take
pleasure in such things.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he said to
the warder, &ldquo;You must certainly shew it to me,&rdquo; and then he
set about the duties of the day. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, when
he heard all that, rose up with his companions, and performed his
duties such as bathing and eating.</p>

<h3 class="main">The adventures of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and the
warder.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And when the night came, and thick darkness was
diffused over the face of things, the prince went out alone and
self-impelled from the chamber in which his companions were sleeping,
in search of adventures, with his body smeared with musk, wearing
dark-blue garments and with his sword in his hand. And as he was
roaming about, a certain man, who was coming along the road and did not
see him on account of the darkness, jostled against him, and struck his
shoulder against his. Then he rushed at him angrily and challenged him
to fight. But the person challenged, being a man not easily abashed,
made an appropriate reply, &ldquo;Why are you perplexed by want of
reflection? If you reflect, you will see that you ought to blame the
moon for not lighting up this night, or the Governor of the world for
not appointing that it should rule with full sway here,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6440src" href="#xd27e6440" name="xd27e6440src">2</a>
since in such darkness causeless quarrels take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was pleased with this clever answer and
he said to him, &ldquo;You are right. Who are you?&rdquo; The man
answered, &ldquo;I am a thief.&rdquo; Whereupon the prince said
falsely, &ldquo;Give me your hand, you are of the same profession as
myself.&rdquo; And the prince made an alliance with him, and went along
with him out of curiosity, and at last reached an old well covered with
grass. And there the man entered a tunnel, and
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta went along it with him, and reached the
harem of that king M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u. And when he got there,
he recognized the man by the light of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the lamp, and lo! it
was the warder Cha&#7751;&#7693;aketu, and not a robber. But the
warder, who was the secret paramour of the king&rsquo;s wife, did not
recognize the prince, because he had other garments on than those he
usually wore,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6450src" href="#xd27e6450"
name="xd27e6450src">3</a> and kept in a corner where there was not much
light.</p>
<p>But the moment the warder arrived, the king&rsquo;s wife, who was
named Manjumat&iacute;, and was desperately in love with him, rose up
and threw her arms round his neck. And she made him sit down on a sofa,
and said to him, &ldquo;Who is this man that you have brought here
to-day?&rdquo; Then he said to her, &ldquo;Make your mind easy, it is a
friend of mine.&rdquo; But Manjumat&iacute; said excitedly, &ldquo;How
can I, ill-starred woman that I am, feel at ease, now that this king
has been saved by M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, after entering the very
jaws of death?&rdquo; When the warder heard her say that, he answered,
&ldquo;Do not grieve, my dear! I will soon kill the king and
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta too.&rdquo; When he said this, she answered,
as fate would have it, &ldquo;Why do you boast? When the king was
seized that day by monsters in the water of the Narmad&aacute;,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta alone was ready to rescue him; why did you
not kill him then? The fact is, you fled in fear. So be silent, lest
some one hear this speech of yours, and then you would certainly meet
with calamity at the hands of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who is a
brave man.&rdquo; When she said this, her paramour the warder lost his
temper with her. He said, &ldquo;Wretched woman, you are certainly in
love with M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, so receive now from me the just
recompense of that taunt.&rdquo; And he rose up to kill her, dagger in
hand. Then a maid, who was her confidante, ran and laid hold of the
dagger with her hand and held it. In the meanwhile Manjumat&iacute;
escaped into another room. And the warder dragged the dagger out of the
maid&rsquo;s hand, cutting her fingers in the process; and returned
home by the way which he came, somewhat confused, with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who was much astonished.</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who could not be recognized in the
darkness, said to the warder, &ldquo;You have reached your own house,
so I will leave you.&rdquo; But the warder said to the prince,
&ldquo;Sleep here to-night, without going further, for you are very
tired.&rdquo; Then the prince consented, as he wished to learn
something of his goings on; and the warder called one of his servants
and said to him, &ldquo;Take this man to the room where the peacock is,
and let him rest there and give him a bed.&rdquo; The servant
said&mdash;&ldquo;I will do as you command,&rdquo; and took the prince
to the room and placed a light in it, and gave him a bed. He then
departed, fastening the outer door with a chain, and
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta saw the peacock there in a cage. He said to
himself, &ldquo;This is the very peacock, that the warder was speaking
of,&rdquo; and out of curiosity he opened its cage. And the peacock
came out and, after looking intently at M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>it fell down and rolled at his feet again and
again. And as it was rolling, the prince saw a string tied round its
neck and at once untied it, thinking that it gave the bird pain. The
peacock, the moment that the thread was loosed from its neck, became
before his eyes his minister Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama. Then
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta embraced the affectionate minister, who
bowed before him, and in his astonishment said to him, &ldquo;Tell me,
friend, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Then
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama said to him in his delight, &ldquo;Listen,
prince, I will tell you my story from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

sinful body.&rdquo; In this frame of mind I remained there, fasting, in

and sat in the shade of that tree. And the good man, seeing me,
questioned me with much persistence, saying, &ldquo;Why do you remain
in this solitary place, my son, with such a downcast face?&rdquo; Then
I told him my story, exactly as it took place, and the old traveller
kindly said to me, to encourage me; &ldquo;Why, being a man, are you

<h3 class="main">Story of Kamal&aacute;kara and
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Ko&#347;ala there was a king, named
Vimal&aacute;kara, and he had a son named Kamal&aacute;kara, who was
made by the Creator admirable in respect of the qualities of courage,
beauty and generosity, as if to outdo Skanda, Kandarpa, and the
wishing-tree of heaven. Then one day a bard, whom he had known before,
came and recited a certain stanza in the presence of that prince, who
deserved to be praised by bards in all the regions of the world.
&ldquo;Where can the row of swans<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6481src"
href="#xd27e6481" name="xd27e6481src">5</a> obtain satisfaction, until
it reaches the lotus-bed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6484src" href=

"noteref" id="xd27e6490src" href="#xd27e6490" name=
"xd27e6490src">8</a>?&rdquo; When the bard, named Manorathasiddhi, had
frequently recited this stanza, prince Kamal&aacute;kara questioned
him, and he said to him: &ldquo;Prince, as I was roaming about, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>reached the city of king Megham&aacute;lin,
named Vidi&#347;&aacute;, the pleasure-ground of the goddess of
prosperity. There I was staying in the house of a professor of singing,
named Dardura, and one day he happened to say to me, &lsquo;To-morrow
the daughter of the king, named Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, will exhibit
in his presence her skill in dancing, which she has lately been
taught.&rsquo; When I heard that, I was filled with curiosity, and
managed to enter the king&rsquo;s palace with him the following day,
and went into the dancing-hall. There I saw the slender-waisted
princess Hans&aacute;val&iacute; dancing before her father, to the
music of a great tabor, looking like a creeper of the tree of Love
agitated by the wind of youth, shaking her ornaments like flowers,
curving her hand like a shoot<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Then I thought, &lsquo;There is no one fitted
to be the husband of this fawn-eyed one, except the prince
Kamal&aacute;kara; so, if she, being such, is not joined to him, why
has the god of love taken the trouble of stringing his bow of flowers
thus fruitlessly? So I will adopt some expedient in this matter.&rsquo;
Thus minded I went, after I had seen the spectacle, to the door of the
king&rsquo;s court, and I put up a notice with this inscription on it;
&lsquo;If there is any painter here, who is a match for me, let him
paint a picture.&rsquo; When no one else dared to tear it down, the
king coming to hear of it, appointed me to paint his daughter&rsquo;s
bower. Then I painted you and your servants, prince Kamal&aacute;kara,
on the wall of the bower of that Hans&aacute;val&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought to myself, &lsquo;If I declare the matter openly,
she will know that I am scheming, so I will let the princess know it by
means of an artifice.&rsquo; So I persuaded a handsome fellow, who was
an intimate friend of mine, to come near the palace, and pretend to be
mad, and I arranged with him beforehand how he was to behave. Now he
was seen a long way off by the princes, as he was roaming about singing
and dancing, and they had him brought into their presence to make game
of him. Then Hans&aacute;val&iacute; saw him, and had him brought by
way of a joke into her bower, and, when he saw the picture of you,
which I had painted there, he began to praise you, saying, &lsquo;I am
fortunate in beholding this Kamal&aacute;kara, who is, like
Vish&#7751;u, an endless store of virtues, with his hand marked with
the lotus and conch, the object of the favour of the goddess of
Fortune.&rsquo; When the princess heard him singing such songs, as he
danced, she said to me, &lsquo;What does this fellow mean? Who is it
that you have painted here?&rsquo; When she asked me this persistently,
I said, &lsquo;This mad fellow must have previously seen this prince,
whom I have painted here out of regard for his beauty.&rsquo; And then
I told her your name, and described to her your good qualities. Then
the young tree of passion grew up in the heart of
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, which was irrigated by the overflowing streams
of gushing love for you. Then the king her father came and saw what was
going on, and in wrath had the pretended madman, who was dancing, and
myself, both turned out of doors. After that she pined away
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>day by day with longing, and was reduced to such
a state that, like a streak of the moon during the wane, she had only
her beauty left. And on the pretence of illness she went to a temple of
Vish&#7751;u that dispels calamity, and so managed to live a solitary
life by the permission of her father. And being unable to sleep, owing
to thinking on you, she could not endure the cruel moonlight, and
remained there ignorant of the changes of day and night. Then she saw
me one day from a window, as I was entering there, and she summoned me,
and honoured me respectfully with dresses and ornaments.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6503src" href="#xd27e6503" name="xd27e6503src">9</a>
And then I went out, and saw this stanza which I have repeated to you
written on the border of a garment that she had given me: hear it
again; &lsquo;Where can the row of swans obtain satisfaction, until it
reaches the lotus-bed, round which sings a host of many noisy birds
delighted at obtaining the lotus-flower.&rsquo; And when I read it, I
knew for certain how she felt towards you, and I came here to inform
you and recited the stanza in your presence, and here is the garment on
which she wrote the stanza.&rdquo; When Kamal&aacute;kara heard the
speech of the bard, and saw the stanza, he joyed exceedingly, thinking
on Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, who had entered his heart, he knew not
whether by eye or ear.</p>
<p>Now it happened that, while he was thinking with eager longing about
the best means of obtaining this princess, his father summoned him and
said to him; &ldquo;My son, unenterprising kings perish like snakes
arrested by a charm, and how can kings rise up again when they have
once perished? But you have been addicted to pleasures, and up to the
present time you have not been visited by any longing for conquest; so
arouse yourself, and fling off sloth; advance and conquer that enemy of
mine the king of Anga, who has left his own country on an enterprise
against me, and I will remain at home. When the brave Kamal&aacute;kara
heard this, he agreed to undertake the enterprise, being desirous of
marching towards the country of his beloved. Then he set out with the
forces which his father assigned him, making the earth and the hearts
of his enemies tremble. And he reached in a few marches the army of the
king of Anga, and when that prince turned round to make a
counter-attack, he fought with him. And the brave hero drank up his
army, as Agastya did the water of the sea, and being victorious,
captured the king alive. And he sent that enemy in chains to his
father, committing him to the care of the principal warder in
accordance with a letter, which he sent with him. But he commissioned
the warder to give the following message by word of mouth to the king,
&ldquo;I now leave this place, my father, to conquer other
enemies.&rdquo; So he went on conquering other enemies, and with his
army augmented by their forces, he at last arrived in the vicinity of
the city of Vidi&#347;&aacute;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>And encamping there he sent an ambassador to Megham&aacute;lin the
father of Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, to ask for her in marriage. When
that king learnt from the ambassador that he had come, not as an enemy,
but for the sake of his daughter, he paid a friendly visit to him in
person. The prince welcomed him; and Megham&aacute;lin, after he had
complimented the prince, said to him, &ldquo;Why did you take the
trouble of coming in person about a business which might have been
negotiated by an ambassador? For I desire this marriage; hear the
reason. Seeing that this Hans&aacute;val&iacute; was even in her
childhood devoted to the worship of Vish&#7751;u, and that she had a
frame delicate as a <i lang="sa-latn">&#347;ir&iacute;sha</i>, I became
anxious about her, and kept saying to myself, &lsquo;Who will be a
fitting husband for this girl.<span class="corr" id="xd27e6520" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> And, as I could not think of a
suitable husband for her, I was deprived of sleep by my anxiety about
the matter, and contracted a violent fever. And in order to allay it, I
worshipped and petitioned Vish&#7751;u, and one night, when I was only
able to sleep a little on account of pain, Vish&#7751;u said to me in a
dream, &lsquo;Let that Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, on account of whom you
have contracted this fever, touch you with her hand, my son, then your
fever will be allayed. For her hand is so holy from worshipping me,
that whenever she touches any one with it, his fever, even though
incurable, will certainly pass away. And you need have no more anxiety
about her marriage, since prince Kamal&aacute;kara is destined to be
her husband. But she will endure some misery for a short time.&rsquo;
When I had been thus instructed by Vish&#7751;u in a dream, I woke up
at the end of the night. Then my fever was removed by the touch of
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;&rsquo;s hand. And so the union of you two is
appointed by the god. Accordingly I bestow on you
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; When he had said this, he had an
auspicious moment fixed for the marriage and returned to his
capital.</p>
<p>There he told all that he had done, and when Hans&aacute;val&iacute;
had heard it, she said in secret to her confidante, named
Kanakamanjar&iacute;, &ldquo;Go and see with your own eyes whether that
prince, to whom I am to be given, is the same as he, who, when painted
here by the artist, captivated my heart. For it is just possible that
my father may wish, out of fear, to bestow me as a gift on some prince
of the same name, that has come here with an army.&rdquo; With these
words she sent off Kanakamanjar&iacute;, acting in accordance with her
own will only.</p>
<p>And the confidante, having assumed the complete disguise of an
ascetic, with rosary of Aksha beads, deer-skin, and matted hair, went
to the camp of that prince, and entered introduced by his attendants,
and beheld him looking like the god that presides over the weapon with
which the god of love conquers the world. And her heart was fascinated
by his beauty, and she remained a moment looking as if she were in
profound meditation. And full of longing she said to herself, &ldquo;If
I am not united with this charming prince, I shall have been born in
vain. So I will take the necessary steps to ensure that, whatever comes
of it.&rdquo; Then she went up to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>him, and gave him her
blessing, and bestowed on him a jewel, and he received the gem politely
and sat down; then she said to him, &ldquo;This is an excellent jewel
of which I have often seen the properties tested. By holding it in your
hand you can render ineffectual the best weapon of your enemy. And I
give it you out of regard for your excellence, for it is not of so much
use to me, prince, as it is to you.&rdquo; When she said this, the
prince began to speak to her, but she forbade him, on the ground that
she had vowed an exclusive devotion to the life of a beggar, and
departed thence.</p>
<p>Then she laid aside the dress of a female ascetic, and assumed a
downcast expression of face, and went into the presence of
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, and when questioned by her, made the following
false statement; &ldquo;I must out of love for you reveal the
king&rsquo;s secret, although it is a matter which ought to be
concealed. When I went from here to the camp of the prince dressed as a
female ascetic, a man came up to me of his own accord and said in a low
voice, &lsquo;Reverend madam, do you know the rites for exorcising
demons?&rsquo; When I heard that, I said to him, looking upon him as
the warder, &lsquo;I know them very well. This is a trifling matter for
me.&rsquo; Then I was immediately introduced into the presence of that
prince Kamal&aacute;kara. And I saw him crouching, possessed by a
demon, having horns on his head, and his attendants were trying to
restrain him; besides he had herbs and a talismanic jewel on him. I
performed certain pretended ceremonies to avert evil, and went out
immediately, saying, &lsquo;To-morrow I will come and take away his
affliction.&rsquo; Accordingly, being exceedingly grieved with the
sight of such an unexpected calamity, I have come here to tell you; it
is for you to decide what you will do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the unsuspecting Hans&aacute;val&iacute; heard this trumped-up
tale of her maid&rsquo;s, terrible as a thunderstroke, she was
distracted and said to her, &ldquo;Out on the spite of destiny! she
brings trouble on her handiwork, even when full of excellences; indeed
the spot on the moon is a disgrace to him who created it. As for this
prince, I chose him as my husband, but I cannot see him, so it is best
for me to die or to retire into some forest. So tell me what I had
better do in this matter.&rdquo; When the guileless lady said this, the
treacherous Kanakamanjar&iacute; answered, &ldquo;Have some maid of
yours, dressed in your clothes, married to him, and we will escape to
some place of refuge; for the people of the palace will be all in a
state of excitement at that time.&rdquo; When the princess heard that,
she said to her wicked confidante, &ldquo;Then do you put on my
clothes, and marry that prince; who else is as faithful to me as
you?<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The wicked
Kanakamanjar&iacute; answered, &ldquo;Cheer up, I will manage to effect
this by a stratagem, happen to me what may. But when the time comes,
you must do as I direct you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>When she had consoled
her with these words, she went and told an intimate friend of hers,
named A&#347;okakar&iacute;, her secret object. And with her she waited
during three days on the desponding Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, who agreed
with them on the measures to he taken.</p>
<p>And when the wedding-day came, the bridegroom Kamal&aacute;kara
arrived at night, with a train of elephants, horses, and footmen. While
all the people of the palace were occupied with festal rejoicing,
Kanakamanjar&iacute;, keeping by an artifice the other maids out of the
way, quickly took Hans&aacute;val&iacute; into her chamber, ostensibly
for the purpose of decking her, and put the princess&rsquo;s dress on
herself, and clothed her in the dress of A&#347;okakar&iacute;, and put
her own dress on her accomplice A&#347;okakar&iacute;, and when night
came, said to Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, &ldquo;If you go out only the
distance of a <i>cos</i> from the western gate of this city, you will
find an old hollow <i lang="sa-latn">&#346;almali</i>-tree. Go and hide
inside it, and await my arrival. And after the business is
accomplished, I will certainly come there to you.&rdquo; When
Hans&aacute;val&iacute; heard these words of her treacherous friend,
she agreed, and went out from the female apartments at night clad in
her garments, and she passed out unperceived by the western gate of the
city, which was crowded with the bridegroom&rsquo;s attendants, and
reached the foot of that <i lang="sa-latn">&#346;almali</i>-tree. But
when she saw that the hollow of it was black with thick darkness, she
was afraid to go into it, so she climbed up a <i lang=
"sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree near it. There she remained hidden by the
leaves, watching for the arrival of her treacherous friend, for she did
not see through her villainy, being herself of a guileless
nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6555src" href="#xd27e6555" name=
"xd27e6555src">10</a></p>
<p>In the palace meanwhile, the auspicious moment having arrived, the
king brought Kanakamanjar&iacute;, who was dressed as
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, and placed her on the sacrificial platform,
and Kamal&aacute;kara married that fair-hued maid, and on account of
its being night nobody detected her. And the moment the marriage was
over, the prince set out for his own camp at full speed by that same
western gate of the city, in order to gain the benefit of propitious
constellations, and he took with him the supposed
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, together with A&#347;okakar&iacute;, who was
personating Kanakamanjar&iacute;. And as he went along, he came near
that <i lang="sa-latn">&#346;almali</i>-tree, in the <i lang=
"sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree near which was concealed
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, who had been so cruelly deceived. And when he
arrived there, the supposed Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, who was on the
back of the elephant, which the king had mounted, embraced him, as if
she were terrified. And he asked her eagerly the reason of that terror,
whereupon she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>artfully replied with gushing tears; &ldquo;My
husband, I remember that, last night, in a dream, a woman like a
R&aacute;kshas&iacute; rushed out from this tree, and seized me to eat
me. Then a certain Br&aacute;hman ran forward and delivered me, and
after he had consoled me, he said, &lsquo;My daughter, you should have
this tree burnt, and if this woman should come out of it, she must be
thrown back into it. So all will turn out well.&rsquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman had said this, he disappeared. And I woke up. Now that I
have seen this tree I remember it. That is why I am frightened.&rdquo;
When she said this, Kamal&aacute;kara immediately ordered his servants
to burn the tree and the woman too. So they burned the tree; and the
pretended Hans&aacute;val&iacute; thought that her mistress was burned
in it, as she did not come out of it. Then she was satisfied, and
Kamal&aacute;kara returned with her to the camp, thinking that he had
got the real Hans&aacute;val&iacute;. And the next morning he returned
rapidly from that place to his city of Ko&#347;ala, and he was anointed
king by his father, who was pleased at his success. And after his
father had gone to the forest, he ruled the earth, having for his wife
Kanakamanjar&iacute; the pretended Hans&aacute;val&iacute;. But the
bard Manorathasiddhi kept at a distance from the palace, because he
feared for his own safety in case she were to find out who he was.</p>
<p>But when Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, who remained that night in the
<i lang="sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree, heard and saw all that, she
perceived that she had been tricked. And she said to herself, as soon
as Kamal&aacute;kara had departed; <span class="corr" id="xd27e6588"
title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Alas! my wicked confidante has
robbed me of my lover by treachery. Alas! she even desires to have me

reliance upon treacherous people not a source of calamity? So I will
throw my unlucky self into the glowing ashes of the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#346;almali</i>-tree, that was burnt for me, and so pay my
debt to the tree.&rdquo; After these reflections she descended from the
tree, determined to destroy herself, but as fate would have it, she
returned to her sober reason, and thought thus within herself;
&ldquo;Why should I destroy myself without reason? If I live, I shall
soon be revenged on that betrayer of her friend. For when my father was
seized with that fever, Vish&#7751;u appeared to him in a dream, and
after saying that he was to be healed by the touch of my hand, said
this to him, &lsquo;Hans&aacute;val&iacute; shall obtain
Kamal&aacute;kara, who will be a suitable husband for her, but she
shall endure calamity for a short time.&rsquo; So I will go somewhere
and wait a little.&rdquo; When she had formed this resolution, she set
out for an uninhabited forest.</p>
<p>And after she had gone a long distance, and was weary, and her steps
began to falter, the night disappeared, as if out of pity, in order to
let her see her way. And the heaven being, as it were, moved with
compassion at beholding her, let fall a flood of tears in the form of
drops of dew. And the sun, the friend of the virtuous, rose up so as to
comfort her, by revealing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>to her both hopes and the face of
the country, and stretched out the fingers of his rays to wipe away her
tears. Then the princess, being a little consoled, went on slowly by
by-paths, avoiding the sight of men; and wounded by the spikes of
<i lang="sa-latn">ku&#347;a</i> grass, she at last reached with
difficulty a certain forest, full of birds which seemed to be singing,
&ldquo;Come here, come here!&rdquo; She entered the wood fatigued, and
was, as it were, courteously fanned by the trees with their creepers
waving in the wind. So she, full of longing for her beloved, beheld
that wood in all the pomp of spring, where the cuckoos cooed sweetly on
fragrant mango-trees in full blossom. And in her despondency she said
to herself; &ldquo;Although this breeze from the Malaya mountain, red
with the pollen of flowers, scorches me like a fire, and these showers
of flowers falling from the trees, while the bees hum, strike me like
showers of the arrows of Love, still I will remain here worshipping
with these flowers the husband of Ram&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6601src" href="#xd27e6601" name="xd27e6601src">11</a> and by so
doing purge away my sin.&rdquo; Having formed this resolution, she
remained bathing in tanks and living on fruit, devoted to the worship
of Vish&#7751;u, in order to gain Kamal&aacute;kara.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile it happened that Kamal&aacute;kara was seized with
a chronic quartan fever. Then the wicked Kanakamanjar&iacute;, who
personated Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, was terrified, and thought thus in
her heart, &ldquo;I have always one fear in my heart, lest
A&#347;okakar&iacute; should reveal my secret, and now a second has
come on the top of it. For the father of Hans&aacute;val&iacute; said
to my husband, in the presence of a large number of persons, that the
touch of his daughter&rsquo;s hand removed fever; and as soon as in his
present attack he shall call that to mind, I shall be exposed, as not
having that power, and ruined. So I will perform on his behalf with all
due rites an incantation for obtaining control over an imp of the
fever-demon, who has the power of removing fever, and who was mentioned
to me long ago by a certain witch. And I will by a stratagem kill this
A&#347;okakar&iacute;, in front of the imp, in order that the offering
to him may be made with human flesh, and so he may be enlisted in my
service and bring about the desired result. So the king&rsquo;s fever
will be cured and A&#347;okakar&iacute; removed at the same time, and
both my fears will be ended; I do not see any chance of a prosperous
issue in any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having formed this resolution, she told A&#347;okakar&iacute; all
the harmless points of her plan, taking care to omit the necessity of
slaying a human being. Then A&#347;okakar&iacute; consented, and
brought the necessary utensils, and Kanakamanjar&iacute; by an artifice
dismissed her attendants, and, accompanied by A&#347;okakar&iacute;
only, went out from the women&rsquo;s apartments secretly at night by a
postern-door, and sword in hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6610src"
href="#xd27e6610" name="xd27e6610src">12</a> made for a deserted temple
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>&#346;iva in which there was one <i lang=
"sa-latn">linga</i>. There she killed with the sword a goat, and
anointed the <i lang="sa-latn">linga</i> with its blood, and made an
offering to it of its flesh, and threw the animal&rsquo;s entrails
round it by way of a garland, and honoured it by placing on its summit
the goat&rsquo;s lotus-like heart, and fumigated it with the smoke of
its eyes, and lastly presented to it the animal&rsquo;s head by way of
oblation. Then she smeared the front of the sacrificial platform with
blood and sandalwood, and painted on it with yellow paint a lotus,
having eight leaves, and on its pericarp she traced with crushed mango
a representation of the demon of fever, with three feet and three
mouths, and with a handful of ashes by way of weapon; and she
represented on the leaves the fever&rsquo;s attendant imps in proper
form, and summoned them with a spell which she knew.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6621src" href="#xd27e6621" name="xd27e6621src">13</a> And then
she wished to make an offering to them, preparatory to bathing, with
human flesh, as I said before, so she said to A&#347;okakar&iacute;,
&ldquo;Now, my friend, prostrate yourself flat on the earth before the
god, for thus you will obtain prosperous fortune.&rdquo; Then she
consented, and flung herself flat on the earth, and the wicked
Kanakamanjar&iacute; gave her a cut with the sword. As it happened, the
sword only wounded her slightly on the shoulder, and she rose up
terrified, and ran away, and seeing Kanakamanjar&iacute; pursuing her,
she exclaimed again and again, &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo; And thereupon
some policemen, who happened to be near, ran to her assistance. When
they saw Kanakamanjar&iacute; pursuing her, sword in hand, with a
ferocious expression of countenance, they thought she was a
R&aacute;kshas&iacute;, and slashed her with their swords till she was
almost dead. But when they heard from the lips of A&#347;okakar&iacute;
the real state of the case, they took both the women to the
king&rsquo;s court, with the governor of the town at their head. When
king Kamal&aacute;kara heard their story, he had that wicked wife and
her confidante brought into his presence. And when they were brought,
what with fear and the severe pain of her wounds, Kanakamanjar&iacute;
died on the spot.</p>
<p>Then the king, in great despondency, said to A&#347;okakar&iacute;,
who was wounded, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Tell me without
fear.&rdquo; Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span>A&#347;okakar&iacute; related from the very
beginning the history of the daring treachery accomplished by
Kanakamanjar&iacute;. Then king Kamal&aacute;kara, having found out the
truth, thus bewailed his lot on that occasion, &ldquo;Alas! I have been
deceived by this supposed Hans&aacute;val&iacute; into burning the real
Hans&aacute;val&iacute; with my own hand, fool that I was! Well! this
wicked woman has met the just reward of her actions, in that, after
becoming the wife of a king, she has been thus put to death. But how
came I to permit cruel Destiny to deceive me with mere outward
appearances, like a child, and so to rob me by taking away my jewel and
giving me glass instead. Moreover, I did not remember that touch of the
hand of Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, of which Vish&#7751;u spoke to her
father, which has given evidence of its power to remove fever.&rdquo;
While Kamal&aacute;kara was thus lamenting, he suddenly recollected the
words of Vish&#7751;u and said to himself, &ldquo;Her father
Megham&aacute;lin told me that Vish&#7751;u said that she should obtain
a husband, but that she should suffer some little affliction, and that
word of the god, made known to men, will not have been spoken in vain.
So it is quite possible that she may have gone somewhere else, and be
still alive, for who knows the mysterious ways of a woman&rsquo;s
heart, any more than those of destiny? So in this matter the bard
Manorathasiddhi must once more be my refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus reflecting, the king sent for that excellent bard, and said to
him, &ldquo;How is it, my good friend, that you are never seen in the
palace?&rdquo; But how can those obtain their wishes, who are deceived
by rogues? When the bard heard that, he said, &ldquo;My excuse is that
this A&#347;okakar&iacute; was well nigh slain, out of fear that she
would reveal the secret. But you must not be despondent about
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, for Vish&#7751;u revealed that she would
suffer calamity for a short time. And he certainly protects her,
because she is ever intent on worshipping him; for virtue prevails; has
it not been seen in the present instance? So I will go, king, to obtain
tidings of her.&rdquo; When the bard said this to the king, he answered
him, &ldquo;I myself will go in search of her with you. For otherwise
my mind cannot be at rest even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, he resolved on the course to be taken,
and next day he entrusted his kingdom to the care of his minister
Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya. And though the minister did all he could to
dissuade him, the king left the town unobserved with Manorathasiddhi.
And he went round to many holy places, hermitages, and forests in
search of her, disregarding physical suffering, for weighty is the
command of Love. And it happened that he and Manorathasiddhi at last
reached the wood, where Hans&aacute;val&iacute; was performing
austerities. There he saw her at the foot of a red
<i>A&#347;oka</i>-tree, thin and pale, but yet charming, like the last
digit of the gleaming moon. And he said to the bard; &ldquo;Who is this
silent and motionless, engaged in meditation? Can she be a goddess, for
her beauty is more than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href=
"#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>human?&rdquo; When the bard heard
that, he looked and said, &ldquo;You are fortunate, my sovereign, in
finding Hans&aacute;val&iacute;; for it is she herself that is standing
there.&rdquo; When Hans&aacute;val&iacute; heard that, she looked at
them, and recognising that bard, she cried out with renewed grief;
&ldquo;Alas! my father, I am ruined! alas my husband,
Kamal&aacute;kara! alas Manorathasiddhi! alas, Destiny, source of
untoward events!&rdquo; Thus lamenting, she fell on the ground in a
faint, and when Kamal&aacute;kara heard and saw her, he too fell on the
earth overpowered with grief. Then they were both brought round by
Manorathasiddhi; and when they had recognised one another for certain,
they were much delighted, and, having crossed the ocean of separation,
they experienced indescribable joy, and they told one another in due
course all their adventures. Then Kamal&aacute;kara returned with
Hans&aacute;val&iacute; and that bard to the city of Ko&#347;ala. There
he received in marriage her hand that had the power of removing
disease, after summoning her father the famous Megham&aacute;lin. Then
Kamal&aacute;kara shone exceedingly bright, being united with
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, both whose wings were pure.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6643src" href="#xd27e6643" name="xd27e6643src">14</a> And
having attained his object in life, he lived happily with her whose
endurance had borne fruit, ruling the earth, inseparable from
Manorathasiddhi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see those who do not lose heart, even in calamity,
obtain all they desire, and on the same principle you should abstain
from suicide, for, if you live, you will be reunited to that
lord.&rdquo; With these words the old traveller closed his tale, and
after dissuading me from death, departed whither he would.</p>
<p>After Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama had told all this to
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta at night in the house of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;aketu, he went on to say:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Continuation of the adventures of
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So, having received useful admonition, I left that
forest and went to the city of Ujjayin&iacute;, for which I knew you
were making, to find you. When I did not find you there, I entered the
house of a certain woman to lodge, as I was worn out, and gave her
money for food. She gave me a bed, and being tired I slept for some
time, but then I woke up, and out of curiosity I remained quiet, and
watched her, and while I was watching, the woman took a handful of
barley, and sowed it all about inside the house, her lip trembling all
the time with muttering spells. Those grains of barley immediately
sprang up, and produced ears, and ripened, and she cut them down, and
parched them, and ground them, and made them into barley-meal. And she
sprinkled the barley-meal with water, and put it in a brass pot, and,
after arranging her house as it was before, she went out quickly to
bathe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, as I saw that she was a witch, I took the liberty of rising up
quickly; and taking that meal out of the brass pot, I transferred it to
the meal-bin, and I took as much barley-meal out of the meal-bin, and
placed it in the brass vessel, taking care not to mix the two kinds.
Then I went back again to bed, and the woman came in, and roused me up,
and gave me that meal from the brass pot to eat, and she ate some
herself, taking what she ate from the meal-bin, and so she ate the
charmed meal, not knowing that I had exchanged the two kinds. The
moment she had eaten that barley-meal, she became a she-goat; then I
took her and sold her by way of revenge to a butcher.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6661src" href="#xd27e6661" name="xd27e6661src">15</a></p>
<p>Then the butcher&rsquo;s wife came up to me and said angrily,
&ldquo;You have deceived this friend of mine&mdash;you shall reap the
fruit of this.&rdquo; When I had been thus threatened by her, I went
secretly out of the town, and being weary I lay down under a <i lang=
"sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree, and went to sleep. And while I was in that
state, that wicked witch, the butcher&rsquo;s wife, came and fastened a
thread on my neck. Then the wicked woman departed, and immediately I
woke up, and when I began to examine myself, lo! I had turned into a
peacock, though I still retained my intelligence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6669src" href="#xd27e6669" name="xd27e6669src">16</a></p>
<p>Then I wandered about for some days much distressed, and one day I
was caught alive by a certain fowler. He brought me here and gave me to
this Cha&#7751;&#7693;aketu, the principal warder of the king of the
Bhillas, by way of a complimentary present. The warder, for his part,
immediately made me over to his wife, and she put me in this house as a
pet bird. And to-day, my prince, you have been guided here by fate, and
have loosened the thread round my neck, and so I have recovered my
human shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let us leave this place quickly, for this warder always
murders next morning<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6676src" href=
"#xd27e6676" name="xd27e6676src">17</a> the companions of his midnight
rambles, for fear his secrets should be disclosed. And to-day he has
brought you here, after you have been a witness of his nightly
adventures, so fasten, my prince, on your neck this thread prepared by
the witch, and turn yourself into a peacock, and go out by this small
window; then I will stretch out my hand and loosen the thread from your
neck, which you must put up to me, and I will fasten it on my own neck
and go out quickly in the same way. Then you must loosen the thread
round my neck, and we shall both recover our former condition. But it
is impossible to go out by the door which is fastened from
outside.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the sagacious Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama had said this,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta agreed to his proposal and so escaped from
the house with him; and he returned to his lodging where his other two
friends were; there he and his friends all spent the night pleasantly
in describing to one another all their adventures.</p>
<p>And in the morning M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, the Bhilla king,
the head of that town, came to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, and after
asking him whether he had spent the night pleasantly, he said to amuse
him, &ldquo;Come, let us play dice.&rdquo; Then
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta&rsquo;s friend &#346;rutadhi, observing that
the Bhilla had come with his warder, said to him, &ldquo;Why should you
play dice? Have you forgotten? To-day we are to see the dance of the
warder&rsquo;s peacock, which was talked about yesterday.&rdquo; When
the &#346;avara king heard that, he remembered, and out of curiosity
sent the warder to fetch the peacock. And the warder remembered the
wounds he had inflicted, and thought to himself, &ldquo;Why did I in my
carelessness forget to put to death that thief, who witnessed my secret
nightly expedition, though I placed him in the peacock&rsquo;s house?
So I will go quickly, and do both the businesses.&rdquo; And thereupon
he went quickly home.</p>
<p>But when he reached his own palace and looked into the house where
the peacock was, he could not find either the thief or the peacock.
Then terrified and despondent he returned and said to his sovereign;
&ldquo;My lord, that peacock has been taken away in the night by a
thief.&rdquo; Then &#346;rutadhi said smiling, &ldquo;The man who took
away your peacock is renowned as a clever thief.&rdquo; And when
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u saw them all smiling, and looking at one
another, he asked with the utmost eagerness what it all meant. Then
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta told the &#346;avara king all his adventures
with the warder; how he met him in the night, and how the warder
entered the queen&rsquo;s apartment as a paramour, and how he drew his
knife in a quarrel; how he himself went to the house of the warder, and
how he set Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama free from his peacock
transformation, and how he escaped thence.</p>
<p>Then M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, after hearing that, and seeing
that the maid in the harem had a knife-wound in the hand, and that when
that thread was replaced for a moment on the neck of
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, he again became a peacock, put his warder
to death at once as a violator of his harem. But he spared the life of
that unchaste queen, on the intercession of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta,
and renouncing her society, banished her to a distance from his court.
And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, though eager to win
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, remained some more days in the
Pulinda&rsquo;s town, treated with great consideration by him, looking
for the arrival of the rest of his friends and his re-union with them.

debased form of Buddhism found throughout this work is no doubt the
Tantra system introduced by Asanga in the sixth century of our era
(Rhys Davids&rsquo; Manual of Buddhism, pp. 207, 208, 209.) To borrow
Dr. Rajendral&aacute;la Mitra&rsquo;s words, who is speaking of even
worse corruptions, (Introduction to the Lalita Vistara, p. 12) it is a

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was thus residing in
the palace of M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, the king of the Bhillas,
accompanied by Vimalabuddhi and his other friends, one day the general
of the Bhilla sovereign came to him in a state of great excitement, and
said to him in the presence of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta; &ldquo;As by
your Majesty&rsquo;s orders I was searching for a man to offer as a
victim to Durg&aacute;, I found one so valiant that he destroyed five
hundred of your best warriors, and I have brought him here disabled by
many wounds.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span>
When the Pulinda chief heard that, he said to the general, &ldquo;Bring
him quickly in here, and shew him to me.&rdquo; Then he was brought in,
and all beheld him smeared with the blood that flowed from his wounds,
begrimed with the dust of battle, bound with cords, and reeling, like a
mad elephant tied up that is stained with the fluid that flows from his
temples mixed with the vermilion painting on his cheek. Then
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta recognised him as his minister
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and ran and threw his arms round his neck,
weeping. Then the king of the Bhillas, hearing from
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta&rsquo;s friends that it was
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, bowed before him, and comforted him as he was
clinging to the feet of his master, and brought him into his palace,
and gave him a bath, and bandaged his wounds, and supplied him
attentively with wholesome food and drink, such as was recommended by
the physicians. Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, after his minister had
been somewhat restored, said to him; &ldquo;Tell me, my friend, what
adventures have you had?&rdquo; Then Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara said in the
hearing of all, &ldquo;Hear, prince, I will tell you my
story.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At that time when I was separated from you by the
curse of the N&aacute;ga, I was so bewildered that I was conscious of
nothing, but went on roaming through that far-extending wilderness. At
last I recovered consciousness and thought in my grief, &ldquo;Alas!
this is a terrible dispensation of unruly destiny. How will
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who would suffer even in a palace, exist in
this desert of burning sand? And how will his companions exist? Thus
reflecting frequently in my mind, I happened, as I was roaming about,
to come upon the abode of Durg&aacute;. And I entered her temple, in
which were offered day and night many and various living creatures, and
which therefore resembled the palace of the god of Death. After I had
worshipped the goddess there, I saw the corpse of a man who had offered
himself, and who held in his hand a sword that had pierced his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=

my grief at being separated from you, determined to propitiate the
goddess by the sacrifice of myself. So I ran and seized his sword. But
at that moment some compassionate female ascetic, after forbidding me
from a distance by a prohibitive shake of the head, came up to me, and
dissuaded me from death, and after asking me my story said to me;
&ldquo;Do not act so, the re-union even of the dead has been seen in
this world, much more of the living. Hear this story in illustration of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vin&iacute;tamati who became a holy
man.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a celebrated city on the earth, of the name
of Ahichchhatr&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6716src" href=
"#xd27e6716" name="xd27e6716src">1</a> in it there dwelt of old time a
mighty king, of the name of Udayatunga. And he had a noble warder named
Kamalamati. This warder had a matchless son named Vin&iacute;tamati.
The lotus, in spite of its threads, and the bow, in spite of its
string, could not be compared to that youth who possessed a string of
good qualities, for the first was hollow and the second crooked. One
day, as he was on a platform on the top of a palace white with plaster,
he saw the moon rising in the beginning of the night, like a splendid
ear-ornament on the darkness of the eastern quarter, made of a shoot
from the wishing-tree of love. And Vin&iacute;tamati, seeing the world
gradually illuminated with its numerous rays, felt his heart leap
within him, and said to himself, &ldquo;Ha! the ways are seen to be
lighted up by the moonlight, as if whitened with plaster, so why should
I not go there and roam about? Accordingly he went out with his bow and
arrows, and roamed about, and after he had gone only a <i>cos</i>, he
suddenly heard a noise of weeping. He went in the direction of the
sound and saw a certain maiden of heavenly appearance weeping, as she
reclined at the foot of a tree. And he said to her, &ldquo;Fair one,
who are you? And why do you make the moon of your countenance like the
moon when flecked with spots, by staining it with tears?&rdquo; When he
said this to her, she answered, &ldquo;Great-souled one, I am the
daughter of a king of the snakes named Gandham&aacute;lin, and my name
is Vijayavat&iacute;. Once on a time my father fled from battle, and
was thus cursed by V&aacute;suki&mdash;&lsquo;Wicked one, you shall be
conquered and become the slave of your enemy.&rsquo; In consequence of
that curse, my father was conquered by his enemy, a Yaksha named
K&aacute;lajihva, and made his servant, and forced to carry a load of
flowers for him. Grieved thereat, I tried for his sake to propitiate
Gaur&iacute; with asceticism, and the holy goddess appeared to me in
visible form, and said this to me, &lsquo;Listen, my child; there is in
the M&aacute;nasa lake a great and heavenly lotus of crystal expanded
into a thousand leaves. Its rays are scattered abroad when it is
touched by the sun-beams, and it gleams like the many-crested head of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>&#346;esha, yellow with the rays of jewels. Once
on a time Kuvera beheld it, and conceived a desire for that lotus, and
after he had bathed in the M&aacute;nasa lake, he began to worship
Vish&#7751;u in order to obtain it. And at that time the Yakshas, his
followers, were playing in the water, in the shapes of Brahmany ducks
and geese, and other aquatic creatures. And it happened that the elder
brother of your enemy K&aacute;lajihva, a Yaksha named
Vidyujj&iacute;va, was playing with his beloved in the form of a
Brahmany drake, and while flapping his wings, he struck and upset the
<i lang="sa-latn">argha</i> vessel held in the extremity of
Kuvera&rsquo;s hand. Then the god of wealth was enraged, and by a curse
made Vidyujj&iacute;va and his wife Brahmany ducks<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6730src" href="#xd27e6730" name="xd27e6730src">2</a> on this
very M&aacute;nasa lake. And K&aacute;lajihva, now that his elder
brother is so transformed and is unhappy at night on account of the
absence of his beloved, assumes out of affection her form every night
to console him, and remains there in the day in his own natural form,
accompanied by your father Gandham&aacute;lin, whom he has made a
slave. So send there, my daughter, the brave and enterprising
Vin&iacute;tamati, of the town of Ahichchhatr&aacute;, the son of the
warder, and take this sword<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6734src" href=
"#xd27e6734" name="xd27e6734src">3</a> and this horse, for with these
that hero will conquer that Yaksha, and will set your father at
liberty. And whatever man becomes the possessor of this excellent
sword, will conquer all his enemies and become a king on the
earth.&rsquo; After saying this, the goddess gave me the sword and
horse, and disappeared. So I have come here to-day in due course to
excite you to the enterprise, and seeing you going out at night with
the favour of the goddess, I brought you here by an artifice, having
caused you to hear a sound of weeping. So accomplish for me that desire
of mine, noble sir!&rdquo; When Vin&iacute;tamati was thus entreated by
her, he immediately consented.</p>
<p>Then the snake-maiden went at once and brought that swift white
horse, that looked like the concentrated rays of the moon, rushing
forth into the extreme points of the earth to slay the darkness, and
that splendid sword, equal in brightness to the starlight sky,
appearing like a glance of the goddess of Fortune in search of a hero,
and gave them both to Vin&iacute;tamati. And he set out with the sword,
after mounting that horse with the maiden, and thanks to its speed he
reached that very lake M&aacute;nasa. The lotus-clumps of the lake were
shaken by the wind, and it seemed by the plaintive cries of its
Brahmany ducks to forbid his approach <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>out of pity for
K&aacute;lajihva. And seeing Gandham&aacute;lin there in the custody of
some Yakshas, he wounded those miserable creatures with his sword and
dispersed them, in order to set him at liberty. When K&aacute;lajihva
saw that, he abandoned the form of a Brahmany duck and rose from the
middle of the lake, roaring like a cloud of the rainy season. In the
course of the fight K&aacute;lajihva soared up into the air, and
Vin&iacute;tamati, with his horse, soared up after him, and seized him
by the hair. And when he was on the point of cutting off his head with
his sword, the Yaksha, speaking in a plaintive voice, implored his
protection. And being spared, he gave him his own ring, that possessed
the power of averting all the calamities called <i lang=
"sa-latn">&iacute;ti</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6752src" href=
"#xd27e6752" name="xd27e6752src">4</a> and with all marks of deference
he released Gandham&aacute;lin from slavery, and Gandham&aacute;lin, in
his delight, gave Vin&iacute;tamati his daughter Vijayavat&iacute;, and
returned home. Then Vin&iacute;tamati, being the possessor of a
splendid sword, ring, horse, and maiden, returned home as soon as the
day broke. There his father welcomed him and questioned him, and was
delighted at the account of his exploits, and so was his sovereign, and
then he married that N&aacute;ga maiden.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6755src" href="#xd27e6755" name="xd27e6755src">5</a></p>
<p>And one day his father Kamalamati said in secret to the youth, who
was happy in the possession of these four priceless things, and of many
accomplishments; &ldquo;The king Udayatunga here has a daughter named
Udayavat&iacute;, well taught in all the sciences, and he has publicly
announced that he will give her to the first Br&aacute;hman or
Kshatriya who conquers her in argument. And by her wonderful skill in
argument she has silenced all other disputants, as by her beauty, which
is the theme of the world&rsquo;s wonder, she has put to shame the
nymphs of heaven. You are a distinguished hero, you are a disputant of
the Kshatriya caste; why do you remain silent? Conquer her in argument,
and marry her.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6763src" href=
"#xd27e6763" name="xd27e6763src">6</a> When Vin&iacute;tamati&rsquo;s
father said this to him, he answered,&mdash;&ldquo;My father, how can
men like me contend with weak women? Nevertheless, I will obey this
order of yours.&rdquo; When the bold youth said this, his father went
to the king, and said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Vin&iacute;tamati will
dispute with the princess to-morrow.&rdquo; And the king approved the
proposal, and Kamalamati returned home, and informed his son
Vin&iacute;tamati of his consent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"
href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next morning the king, like a swan, took up his position in the
midst of the lotus-bed of the assembly of learned men, and the
disputant Vin&iacute;tamati entered the hall, resplendent like the sun,
and being gazed on by the eyes of all the accomplished men who were
assembled there, that were turned towards him, he, as it were, animated
the lotus-bed with circling bees. And soon after the princess
Udayavat&iacute; came there slowly, like the bow of the god of love
bent with the string of excellence; adorned with splendid
sweetly-tinkling ornaments, that seemed, as it were, to intimate her
first objection before it was uttered.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6772src" href="#xd27e6772" name="xd27e6772src">7</a> A pure
streak of the moon in a clear heaven would give some idea of her
appearance when she was seated on her emerald throne. Then she made her
first objection, stringing on the threads of her glittering teeth a
chain of elegant words like jewels. But Vin&iacute;tamati proved that
her objection was based upon premisses logically untenable, and he soon
silenced the fair one, refuting her point by point. Then the learned
audience commended him, and the princess, though beaten in argument,
considered that she had triumphed, as she had gained an excellent
husband. And Udayatunga bestowed on Vin&iacute;tamati his daughter,
whom he had won in the arguing match. And the king loaded
Vin&iacute;tamati with jewels, and he lived united to the daughter of a
snake and the daughter of a king.</p>
<p>Once on a time, when he was engaged in gambling, and was being
beaten by other gamblers, and much distressed in mind thereat, a
Br&aacute;hman came and asked him for food with great importunity.</p>
<p>He was annoyed at that, and whispered in the ear of his servant, and
caused to be presented to the Br&aacute;hman a vessel full of sand
wrapped up in a cloth. The simple-minded Br&aacute;hman thought, on
account of its weight, that it must be full of gold, and went to a
solitary place and opened<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6785src" href=
"#xd27e6785" name="xd27e6785src">8</a> it. And seeing that it was full
of sand, he flung it down on the earth, and saying to himself,
&ldquo;The man has deceived me,&rdquo; he went home despondent. But
Vin&iacute;tamati thought no more of the matter, and left the gambling,
and remained at home with his wives in great comfort.</p>
<p>And in course of time, the king Udayatunga became unable to bear the
burden of the empire, as his vigour in negotiations and military
operations was relaxed by old age.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6793src"
href="#xd27e6793" name="xd27e6793src">9</a> Then, as he had no son, he
appointed his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>son-in-law Vin&iacute;tamati his successor, and
went to the Ganges to lay down his body. And as soon as
Vin&iacute;tamati obtained the government, he conquered the ten
cardinal points by the virtue of his horse and his sword. And, by the
might of his calamity-averting ring, his kingdom was free from sickness
and famine, like that of R&aacute;ma.</p>
<p>Now, once on a time, there came to that king from a foreign country
a mendicant, named Ratnachandr&aacute;mati, who was among other
disputants like the lion among elephants. The king, who was fond of
accomplished men, entertained him, and the mendicant challenged him to
dispute on the following terms, which he uttered in the form of a
verse; &ldquo;If thou art vanquished, O king, thou must adopt the law
of Buddha; if I am vanquished, I will abandon the rags of a Buddhist
mendicant, and listen to the teaching of the Br&aacute;hmans.&rdquo;
The king accepted this challenge, and argued with the mendicant for
seven days, and on the eighth day the mendicant conquered that king,
who in the dispute with Udayavat&iacute; had conquered the
&ldquo;Hammer of Shavelings.&rdquo; Then faith arose in the breast of
the king, and he adopted the Bauddha law taught by that mendicant,
which is rich in the merit of benefiting all creatures; and becoming
devoted to the worship of Jina, he built monasteries and alms-houses
for Buddhist mendicants, Br&aacute;hmans, and other sectaries, and all
men generally.</p>
<p>And being subdued in spirit by the practice of that law, he asked
that mendicant to teach him the rule for the discipline leading to the
rank of a Bodhisattva, a rule which involves benefits to all. And the
mendicant said to him; &ldquo;King, the great discipline of a
Bodhisattva is to be performed by those who are free from sin, and by
no others. Now you are not tainted with any sin which is palpable, and
therefore visible to men like myself, but find out by the following
method, if you have any minute sin, and so destroy it.&rdquo; With
these words the mendicant taught him a charm<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6802src" href="#xd27e6802" name="xd27e6802src">10</a> for
producing dreams, and the king, after having had a dream, said to the
mendicant in the morning, &ldquo;Teacher, I fancied in my dream last
night that I went to the other world, and being hungry I asked for some
food. And then some men with maces in their hands said to me,
&lsquo;Eat, O king, these numerous grains of hot sand earned by you,
which you gave long ago to the hungry Br&aacute;hman, when he came to
beg of you. If you give away ten crores of gold, you will be liberated
from this guilt.&rsquo; When the men with maces had said this to me, I
woke up, and lo! the night had come to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had related his dream, he gave away, by order of the
mendicant, ten crores of gold as an atonement for his sin, and again
employed the charm for producing dreams. And again he had that dream,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>and in the morning when he got up, he related
it, and said; &ldquo;Last night also those mace-bearers in the other
world gave me sand to eat, when I was hungry, and then I said to
them,&mdash;&lsquo;Why should I eat this sand, though I have bestowed
alms?&rsquo; Then they said to me&mdash;&lsquo;Your gift was of no
avail, for among the gold coins was one belonging to a
Br&aacute;hman;&rsquo; when I heard this I woke up.&rdquo; Having told
his dream in these words, the king gave away another ten crores of gold
to beggars.</p>
<p>And again, when the night came, he used that charm for producing
dreams, and again he had a dream, and next morning when he got up, he
related it in the following words; &ldquo;Last night too those men in
the other world gave me sand to eat in my dream, and when I questioned
them, they said this to me, &lsquo;King, that gift of yours also is of
no avail, for to-day a Br&aacute;hman has been robbed and murdered in a
forest in your country by bandits, and you did not protect him, so your
gift is of no avail on account of your not protecting your subjects; so
give to-day double the gift of yesterday.&rsquo; When I heard this I
woke up.&rdquo; After the king had related his dream to his spiritual
guide in these words, he gave double his former gift.</p>
<p>Then he said to the mendicant, &ldquo;Teacher, how can men like
myself obey in this world a law which admits of so many
infractions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mendicant heard that, he said, &ldquo;Wise men should not
allow such a little thing to damp their ardour in the keeping of the
law of righteousness. The gods themselves protect firm men, endowed
with perseverance, that swerve not from their duty, and they bring
their wishes to fulfilment. Have you not heard the story of the
adorable Bodhisattva in his former birth as a boar? Listen, I will tell
it you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Holy Boar.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there dwelt in a cavern in the Vindhya
mountains a wise boar, who was an incarnation of a portion of a Buddha,
together with his friend a monkey. He was a benefactor of all
creatures, and he remained always in the society of that friend,
honouring guests, and so he spent the time in occupations suited to
him. But once on a time there came on a storm lasting for five days,
which was terrible, in that it hindered with its unintermitting
rainfall the movements of all living creatures. On the fifth day, as
the boar was lying asleep with the monkey at night, there came to the
door of the cave a lion with his mate and his cub. Then the lion said
to his mate, &ldquo;During this long period of bad weather we shall
certainly die of hunger from not obtaining any animal to eat.&rdquo;
The lioness answered, &ldquo;It is clear that hunger will prevent all
of us from surviving, so you two had better eat me and so save your
lives. For you are my lord and master, and this son of ours is our very
life; you will easily get another mate like me, so ensure the welfare
of you two by devouring me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, as chance would have it, that noble boar woke up and heard the
conversation of the lion and his mate. And he was delighted, and
thought to himself, &ldquo;The idea of my receiving such guests on such
a night in such a storm! Ah! to-day my merit in a former state of
existence has brought forth fruit. So let me satiate these guests with
this body that perishes in a moment, while I have a chance of doing
so.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the boar rose up, and went out, and
said to the lion with an affectionate voice; &ldquo;My good friend, do
not despond. For here I am ready to be eaten by you and your mate and
your cub: so eat me.&rdquo; When the boar said this, the lion was
delighted and said to his mate, &ldquo;Let this cub eat first, then I
will eat, and you shall eat after me.&rdquo; She agreed, and first the
cub ate some of the flesh of the boar, and then the lion himself began
to eat. And while he was eating, the noble boar said to him,
&ldquo;Drink my blood quickly, before it sinks into the ground, and
satisfy your hunger with my flesh, and let your mate eat the
rest.&rdquo; While the boar was saying this, the lion gradually
devoured his flesh until nothing but bones was left, but still the
virtuous boar did not die, for his life remained in him, as if to see
what would be the end of his endurance. And in the meanwhile the
lioness, exhausted with hunger, died in the cave, and the lion went off
somewhere or other with his cub, and the night came to an end. At this
juncture his friend the monkey woke up, and went out, and seeing the
boar reduced to such a condition, said to him in the utmost excitement,
&ldquo;Who reduced you to such a state? Tell me, my friend, if you
can.&rdquo; Thereupon the heroic boar told him the whole story. Then
the monkey prostrated himself at his feet, and said to him with
tears,&mdash;&ldquo;You must be a portion of some divinity, since you
have thus rescued yourself from this animal nature: so tell me any wish
that you may have, and I will endeavour to fulfil it for you.&rdquo;
When the monkey said this to the boar, the boar answered;
&ldquo;Friend, the only wish that I have is one difficult for even
Destiny to fulfil. For my heart longs that I may recover my body as
before, and that this unfortunate lioness that died of hunger before my
eyes, may return to life, and satiate her hunger by devouring
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boar was saying this, the god of Justice appeared in
bodily form, and stroking him with his hand, turned him into a chief of
sages possessing a celestial body. And he said to him; &ldquo;It was I
that assumed the form of this lion, and lioness, and cub, and produced
this whole illusion, because I wished to conquer thee who art
exclusively intent on benefiting thy fellow-creatures; but thou,
possessing perfect goodness, gavest thy life for others, and so hast
triumphed over me the god of Justice, and gained this rank of a chief
of sages.&rdquo; The sage, hearing this, and seeing the god of Justice
standing in front of him, said, &ldquo;Holy lord, this rank of chief of
sages, even though attained, gives me no pleasure, since <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>my
friend this monkey has not as yet thrown off his animal nature.&rdquo;
When the god of Justice heard this, he turned the monkey also into a
sage. Of a truth association with the great produces great benefit.
Then the god of Justice and the dead lioness disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, king, that it is easy for those, who in the
strength of goodness do not relax their efforts after virtue, and are
aided by gods, to attain the ends which they desire.&rdquo; When the
generous king Vin&iacute;tamati had heard this tale from the Buddhist
mendicant, he again used, when the night came, that charm for obtaining
a dream. And after he had had a dream, he told it the next morning to
the mendicant: &ldquo;I remember, a certain divine hermit said to me in
my dream &lsquo;Son, you are now free from sin, enter on the discipline
for obtaining the rank of a Bodhisattva.&rsquo; And having heard that
speech I woke up this morning with a mind at ease.&rdquo; When the king
had said this to the mendicant, who was his spiritual guide, he took
upon himself, with his permission, that difficult vow on an auspicious
day; and then he remained continually showering favours on suitors, and
yet his wealth proved inexhaustible, for prosperity is the result of
virtue.</p>
<p>One day a Br&aacute;hman suitor came and said to him: &ldquo;King, I
am a Br&aacute;hman, an inhabitant of the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. There a Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa has
occupied my sacrificial fire-chamber and seized my son, and no
expedient, which I can make use of, is of any avail against him. So I
have come here to petition you, who are the wishing-tree of suppliants;
give me that ring of yours that removes all noxious things, in order
that I may have success.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman made this
request to the king, he gave him without reluctance the ring he had
obtained from K&aacute;lajihva. And when the Br&aacute;hman departed
with it, the fame of the king&rsquo;s Bodhisattva-vow was spread abroad
throughout the world.</p>
<p>Afterwards there came to him one day another guest, a prince named
Indukala&#347;a, from the northern region. The self-denying king, who
knew that the prince was of high lineage, shewed him respect, and asked
him what he desired. The prince answered, &ldquo;You are celebrated on
earth as the wishing-stone of all suitors, you would not send away
disappointed a man who even asked you for your life. Now I have come to
you as a suppliant, because I have been conquered and turned out of my
father&rsquo;s kingdom by my brother, whose name is Kanakakala&#347;a.
So give me, hero, your excellent sword and horse, in order that by
their virtue I may conquer the pretender and obtain my kingdom.&rdquo;
When king Vin&iacute;tamati heard that, be gave that prince his horse,
and his sword, though they were the two talismanic jewels that
protected his kingdom, and so unshaken was his self-denial that he
never hesitated for a moment, though his ministers heaved sighs with
downcast faces. So the prince, having obtained the horse and sword,
went and conquered his brother by their aid, and got possession of his
kingdom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>But his brother <span class="corr" id="xd27e6840" title=
"Source: Kanakakal&aacute;sa">Kanakakala&#347;a</span>, who was
deprived of the kingdom he had seized, came to the capital of that king
Vin&iacute;tamati; and there he was preparing in his grief to enter the
fire, but Vin&iacute;tamati, hearing of it, said to his ministers;
&ldquo;This good man has been reduced to this state by my fault, so I
will do him the justice, which I owe him, by giving him my kingdom. Of
what use is this kingdom to me, unless it is employed to benefit my
fellow-creatures? As I have no children, let this man be my son and
inherit my kingdom.&rdquo; After saying this, the king summoned
Kanakakala&#347;a, and in spite of the opposition of his ministers gave
him the kingdom.</p>
<p>And after he had given away the kingdom, he immediately left the
city with unwavering mind, accompanied by his two wives. And his
subjects, when they saw it, followed him distracted, bedewing the
ground with their tears, and uttering such laments as these,
&ldquo;Alas! the nectar-rayed moon had become full so as to refresh the
world, and now a cloud has suddenly descended and hid it from our eyes.
Our king, the wishing-tree of his subjects, had begun to satisfy the
desires of all living creatures, when lo! he is removed somewhere or
other by fate.&rdquo; Then Vin&iacute;tamati at last prevailed on them
to return, and with unshaken resolution went on his way, with his
wives, to the forest, without a carriage.</p>
<p>And in course of time he reached a desert without water or tree,
with sands heated by the sun, which appeared as if created by Destiny
to test his firmness. Being thirsty and exhausted with the fatigue of
the long journey, he reclined for a moment in a spot in this desert,
and both he and his two wives were overtaken by sleep. When he woke up
and looked about him, he beheld there a great and wonderful garden
produced by the surpassing excellence of his own virtue. It had in it
tanks full of cool pure water adorned with blooming lotuses, it was
carpeted with dark green grass, its trees bent with the weight of their
fruit, it had broad, high, smooth slabs of rock in shady places, in
fact it seemed like Nandana drawn down from heaven by the power of the
king&rsquo;s generosity. The king looked again and again, and was
wondering whether it could be a dream, or a delusion, or a favour
bestowed on him by the gods, when suddenly he heard a speech uttered in
the air by two Siddhas, who were roaming through the sky in the shape
of a pair of swans, &ldquo;King, why should you wonder thus at the
efficacy of your own virtue? So dwell at your ease in this garden of
perennial fruits and flowers.&rdquo; When king Vin&iacute;tamati heard
this speech of the Siddhas, he remained in that garden with mind at
ease, practising austerities, together with his wives.</p>
<p>And one day, when he was on a slab of rock, he beheld near him a
certain man about to commit suicide by hanging himself. He went to him
immediately, and with kindly words talked him over, and prevailed on
him not to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>destroy himself, and asked him the reason of his
wishing to do so. Then the man said, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you the
whole story from the beginning. I am the son of
N&aacute;ga&#347;&uacute;ra, Soma&#347;&uacute;ra by name, of the race
of Soma. It was said by those versed in the study of astrology, that my
nativity prognosticated that I should be a thief, so my father, afraid
that that would come to pass, instructed me diligently in the law.
Though I studied the law, I was led by association with bad companions
to take to a career of thieving. For who is able to alter the actions
of a man in his previous births?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was one day caught among some thieves by the police,
and taken to the place of impalement, in order to be put to death. At
that moment a great elephant belonging to the king, which had gone mad,
and broken its fastening, and was killing people in all directions,
came to that very place. The executioners, alarmed at the elephant,
left me and fled somewhere or other, and I escaped in that confusion
and made off. But I heard from people that my father had died on
hearing that I was being led off to execution, and that my mother had
followed him. Then I was distracted with sorrow, and as I was wandering
about despondent, intent on self-destruction, I happened to reach in
course of time this great uninhabited wood. No sooner had I entered it,
than a celestial nymph suddenly revealed herself to me, and approached
me, and consoling me said to me; &lsquo;My son, this retreat, which you
have come to, belongs to the royal sage Vin&iacute;tamati, so your sin
is destroyed, and from him you shall learn wisdom.&rsquo; After saying
this, she disappeared; and I wandered about in search of that royal
sage, but not being able to find him, I was on the point of abandoning
the body, out of disappointment, when I was seen by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Soma&#347;&uacute;ra had said this, that royal sage took him to
his own hut, and made himself known to him, and honoured him as a
guest; and after he had taken food, the kingly hermit, among many pious
discourses, told him, as he listened submissively, the following tale,
with the object of dissuading him from ignorance.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Devabh&uacute;ti.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ignorance, my son, is to be avoided, for it brings
harm in both worlds upon men of bewildered intellects: listen to this
legend of sacred story. There lived in Panch&aacute;la, of old time, a
Br&aacute;hman named Devabh&uacute;ti, and that Br&aacute;hman, who was
learned in the Vedas, had a chaste wife named Bhogadatt&aacute;. One
day when he had gone to bathe, his wife went into the kitchen-garden to
get vegetables, and saw a donkey belonging to a washerman eating them.
So she took up a stick and ran after the donkey, and the animal fell
into a pit, as it was trying to escape, and broke its hoof. When its
master heard of that, he came in a passion, and beat with a stick, and
kicked the Br&aacute;hman woman. Accordingly she, being pregnant, had a
miscarriage; but the washerman returned home with his donkey.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then her husband, hearing of it, came home after bathing, and after
seeing his wife, went, in his distress, and complained to the chief
magistrate of the town. The foolish man immediately had the washerman,
whose name was Bal&aacute;sura, brought before him, and, after hearing
the pleadings of both parties, delivered this judgment, &ldquo;Since
the donkey&rsquo;s hoof is broken, let the Br&aacute;hman carry the
donkey&rsquo;s load for the washerman, until the donkey is again fit
for work. And let the washerman make the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s wife
pregnant again, since he made her miscarry. Let this be the punishment
of the two parties respectively.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard
this, he and his wife, in their despair, took poison and died. And when
the king heard of it, he put to death that inconsiderate judge, who had
caused the death of a Br&aacute;hman, and he had to be born for a long
time in the bodies of animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So people, who are obscured by the darkness of ignorance,
stray into the evil paths of their vices, and not setting in front of
them the lamp of sound treatises, of a surety stumble. When the royal
sage had said this, Soma&#347;&uacute;ra begged him to instruct him
further, and Vin&iacute;tamati, in order to train him aright, said,
&ldquo;Listen, my son, I will teach you in due order the doctrine of
perfections.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the generous Induprabha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived a long time ago in Kurukshetra a king of
the name of Malayaprabha. One day the king was about to give money to
his subjects in a time of famine. But his ministers dissuaded him from
doing so, out of avarice; thereupon his son Induprabha said to him;
&ldquo;Father, why do you neglect your subjects at the bidding of
wicked ministers? For you are their wishing-tree, and they are your
cows of plenty.&rdquo; When his son persisted in saying this, the king,
who was under the influence of his ministers, got annoyed, and said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;What, my son, do I possess inexhaustible wealth? If,
without inexhaustible wealth, I am to be a wishing-tree to my subjects,
why do you not take upon yourself that office.&rdquo; When the son
heard that speech of his father&rsquo;s, he made a vow that he would
attain by austerities the condition of a wishing-tree, or die in the
attempt.</p>
<p>Having formed this determination, the heroic prince went off to a
forest where austerities were practised, and as soon as he entered it,
the famine ceased. And when Indra was pleased with his severe
austerities, he craved a boon from him, and became a wishing-tree in
his own city. And he seemed to attract the distant, and to summon
suitors with his boughs stretched out in all directions, and with the
songs of his birds. And every day he granted the most difficult boons
to his petitioners. And he made his father&rsquo;s subjects as happy as
if they were in Paradise, since they had nothing left to wish for. One
day Indra came to him and said to him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>tempting him;
&ldquo;You have fulfilled the duty of benefiting others; come to
Paradise.&rdquo; Then that prince, who had become a wishing-tree,
answered him, &ldquo;When these other trees with their pleasing flowers
and fruits are for ever engaged in benefiting others, regardless of
their own interests, how can I, who am a wishing-tree, disappoint so
many men, by going to heaven for the sake of my own happiness?&rdquo;
When Indra heard this noble answer of his, he said, &ldquo;Then let all
these subjects come to heaven also.&rdquo; Then the prince, who had
become a wishing-tree, replied, &ldquo;If you are pleased with me, take
all these subjects to heaven; I do not care for it: I will perform a
great penance for the sole object of benefiting others.&rdquo; When
Indra heard this, he praised him as an incarnation of Buddha, and being
pleased, granted his petition, and returned to heaven, taking those
subjects with him. And Induprabha left the shape of a tree, and living
in the forest, obtained by austerities the rank of a Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So those, who are devoted to charity, attain success, and now
I have told you the doctrine of the perfection of charity; hear that of
the perfection of chastity.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the parrot, who was taught virtue by the king
of the parrots.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago there lived on the Vindhya mountain a
continent king of parrots, named Hemaprabha, who was an incarnation of
a portion of a Buddha, and was rich in chastity that he had practised
during a former birth. He remembered his former state and was a teacher
of virtue. He had for warder a parrot named Ch&aacute;rumati, who was a
fool enslaved to his passions. Once on a time, a female parrot, his
mate, was killed by a fowler, who was laying snares, and he was so much
grieved at being separated from her, that he was reduced to a miserable
condition. Then Hemaprabha, the wise king of the parrots, in order by
an artifice to rescue him from his grief, told him this false tale for
his good; &ldquo;Your wife is not dead, she has escaped from the snare
of the fowler, for I saw her alive a moment ago. Come, I will shew her
to you.&rdquo; Having said this, the king took Ch&aacute;rumati through
the air to a lake. There he shewed him his own reflection in the water,
and said to him; &ldquo;Look! here is your wife!&rdquo; When the
foolish parrot heard that, and saw his own reflection in the water, he
went into it joyfully, and tried to embrace and kiss his wife. But not
being embraced in return by his beloved, and not hearing her voice, he
said to himself: &ldquo;Why does not my beloved embrace me and speak to
me.&rdquo; Supposing therefore that she was angry with him, he went and
brought an <i lang="sa-latn">&aacute;malaka</i> fruit, and dropped it
on his own reflection, thinking that it was his beloved, in order to
coax her. The <i lang="sa-latn">&aacute;malaka</i> fruit sank into the
water, and rose again to the surface, and the parrot, supposing that
his gift had been rejected by his beloved, went full of grief to king
Hemaprabha and said to him, &ldquo;King, that wife of mine will not
touch me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>or speak to me. Moreover she rejected the
<i lang="sa-latn">&aacute;malaka</i> fruit which I gave her.&rdquo;
When the king heard that, he said to him slowly, as if he were
reluctant to tell it, &ldquo;I ought not to tell you this, but
nevertheless I will tell you, because I love you so much. Your wife is
at present in love with another, so how can she shew you affection? And
I will furnish you with ocular proof of it in this very tank.&rdquo;
After saying this, he took him there, and shewed him their two
reflections close together in the tank. When the foolish parrot saw it,
he thought his wife was in the embrace of another male parrot, and
turning round disgusted, he said to the king, &ldquo;Your Majesty, this
is the result of my folly in not listening to your advice: So tell me,
now, what I ought to do.&rdquo; When the warder said this, king
Hemaprabha, thinking that he had now an opportunity of instructing him,
thus addressed him; &ldquo;It is better to take H&aacute;l&aacute;hala
poison, it is better to wreathe a serpent round one&rsquo;s neck, than
to repose confidence in females, a calamity against which neither
charms nor talismanic jewels avail. Females, being, like the winds,
very changeful, and enveloped with a thick cloud of passion,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6893src" href="#xd27e6893" name=
"xd27e6893src">11</a> defile those who are walking in the right path,
and disgrace them altogether. So wise men, of firm nature, should not
cleave to them, but should practise chastity, in order to obtain the
rank of sages who have subdued their passions.&rdquo; Ch&aacute;rumati,
having been thus instructed by the king, renounced the society of
females, and gradually became continent like Buddha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, those that are rich in chastity deliver others;
and, now that I have instructed you in the perfection of chastity,
listen to the perfection of patience.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the patient hermit &#346;ubhanaya.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived on the Ked&aacute;ra mountain a great
hermit, named &#346;ubhanaya, who was for ever bathing in the waters of
the Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;, and was gentle and emaciated with penance.
One night, some robbers came there to look for some gold, which they
had previously buried there, but they could not find it anywhere.
Accordingly, thinking that in that uninhabited place it could only have
been carried off by the hermit, they entered his cell and said to him:
&ldquo;Ah! you hypocritical hermit, give up our gold, which you have
taken from the earth, for you have succeeded in robbing us, who are
robbers by profession.&rdquo; When the hermit, who had not taken the
treasure, was falsely reproached in these words by the robbers, he
said, &ldquo;I did not take away your gold, and I have never seen any
gold.&rdquo; Then the good hermit was beaten with sticks by those
robbers, and yet the truthful man continued to tell the same story; and
then the robbers cut off, one after another, his hands and his feet,
thinking that he was obstinate, and finally gouged out his eyes. But
when they found that, in spite of all this, he continued to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>tell the same tale without flinching, they came
to the conclusion that some one else had stolen their gold, and they
returned by the way that they came.</p>
<p>The next morning a king, named &#346;ekharajyoti, a pupil of that
hermit&rsquo;s, who had come to have an interview with him, saw him in
that state. Then, being tortured with sorrow for his spiritual
guide,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6907src" href="#xd27e6907" name=
"xd27e6907src">12</a> he questioned him, and found out the state of the
case, and had a search made for those robbers, and had them brought to
that very spot. And he was about to have them put to death, when the
hermit said to him; &ldquo;King, if you put them to death, I will kill
myself. If the sword did this work on me, how are they in fault? And if
they put the sword in motion, anger put them in motion, and their anger
was excited by the loss of their gold, and that was due to my sins in a
previous state of existence, and that was due to my ignorance, so my
ignorance is the only thing that has injured me. So my ignorance should
be slain by me. Moreover, even if these men deserved to be put to death
for doing me an injury, ought not their lives to be saved on account of
their having done me a benefit? For if they had not done to me what
they have done, there would have been no one with regard to whom I
could have practised patience, of which the fruit is emancipation? So
they have done me a thorough benefit.&rdquo; With many speeches of this
kind did the patient hermit instruct the king, and so he delivered the
robbers from punishment. And on account of the excellence of his
asceticism his body immediately became unmutilated as before, and that
moment he attained emancipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus patient men escape from the world of births. I have now
explained to you the perfection of patience; listen to the perfection
of perseverance.&rdquo;</p>

his sides wings of grass, and continually leaping up, he tried to learn
the art of flying in the air. And as he continued to make this useless
attempt every day, he was at last seen by the prince while he was

<h3 class="main">Story of Malayam&aacute;lin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of old time there dwelt in the Carnatic a rich
merchant, named <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>Vijayam&aacute;lin, and he had a son named
Malayam&aacute;lin. One day Malayam&aacute;lin, when he was grown up,
went with his father to the king&rsquo;s court, and there he saw the
daughter of the king Induke&#347;arin, Induya&#347;as by name. That
maiden, like a bewildering creeper of love,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6924src" href="#xd27e6924" name="xd27e6924src">13</a> entered the
heart of the young merchant, as soon as he saw her. Then he returned
home, and remained in a state of pallor, sleepless at night, and during
the day cowering with contracted limbs, having taken upon himself the
<i lang="sa-latn">kumuda</i>-vow.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6930src"
href="#xd27e6930" name="xd27e6930src">14</a> And thinking continually
of her, he was averse to food and all other things of the kind, and
even when questioned by his relations, he gave no more answer than if
he had been dumb.</p>
<p>Then, one day, the king&rsquo;s painter, whose name was Mantharaka,
an intimate friend of his, said to him in private, when in this state
owing to the sorrow of separation: &ldquo;Friend, why do you remain
leaning against the wall like a man in a picture? Like a lifeless
image, you neither eat, nor hear, nor see.&rdquo; When his friend the
painter asked him this question persistently, the merchant&rsquo;s son
at last told him his desire. The painter said to him; &ldquo;It is not
fitting that you, a merchant&rsquo;s son, should fall in love with a
princess. Let the swan desire the beautiful face of the lotuses of all
ordinary lakes, but what has he to do with the delight of enjoying the
lotus of that lake, which is the navel of Vish&#7751;u?<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Still the painter could not
prevent him from nursing his passion; so he painted the princess on a
piece of <span class="corr" id="xd27e6938" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>, and gave her picture to him to solace
his longing, and to enable him to while away the time. And the young
merchant spent his time in gazing on, coaxing, and touching, and
adorning her picture, and he fancied that it was the real princess
Induya&#347;as, and gradually became absorbed in her, and did all that
he did under that belief.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6941src" href=
"#xd27e6941" name="xd27e6941src">15</a> And in course of time he was so
engrossed by that fancy, that he seemed to see her, though she was only
a painted figure, talking to him and kissing him. Then he was happy,
because he had obtained in imagination union with his beloved, and he
was contented, because the whole world was for him contained in that
piece of painted <span class="corr" id="xd27e6947" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>.</p>
<p>One night, when the moon was rising, he took the picture and went
out of his house with it to a garden, to amuse himself with his
beloved. And there he put down the picture at the foot of a tree, and
went to a distance, to pick flowers for his darling. At that moment he
was seen by a hermit, named Vinayajyoti, who came down from heaven out
of compassion, to rescue him from his delusion. He by his supernatural
power painted in one part of the picture a live black cobra, and stood
near invisible. In the meanwhile Malayam&aacute;lin returned there,
after gathering those flowers, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>seeing the black serpent on
the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6954" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>, he reflected, &ldquo;Where does this
serpent come from now? Has it been created by fate to protect this fair
one, the treasure-house of beauty.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, he adorned
with flowers the fair one on the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6957"
title="Source: canvass">canvas</span>, and fancying that she
surrendered herself to him, he embraced her, and asked her the above
question, and at that very moment the hermit threw an illusion over
him, which made him see her bitten by the black snake and unconscious.
Then he forgot that it was only <span class="corr" id="xd27e6960"
title="Source: canvass">canvas</span>, and exclaiming, alas! alas! he
fell distracted on the earth, like a Vidy&aacute;dhara brought down by
the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6963" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span> acting as a talisman. But soon he
recovered consciousness, and rose up weeping and determined on suicide,
and climbed up a lofty tree, and threw himself from its top. But, as he
was falling, the great hermit appeared to him, and bore him up in his
hands, and consoled him, and said to him, &ldquo;Foolish boy, do you
not know that the real princess is in her palace, and that this
princess on the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6967" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span> is a painted figure devoid of life? So
who is it that you embrace, or who has been bitten by the serpent? Or
what is this delusion of attributing reality to the creation of your
own desire, that has taken possession of your passionate heart? Why do
you not investigate the truth with equal intensity of contemplation, in
order that you may not again become the victim of such
sorrows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit had said this to the young merchant, the night of
his delusion was dispersed, and he recovered his senses, and, bowing
before the hermit, he said to him; &ldquo;Holy one, by your favour I
have been rescued from this calamity; do me the favour of rescuing me
also from this changeful world.&rdquo; When Malayam&aacute;lin made
this request to the hermit, who was a Bodhisattva, he instructed him in
his own knowledge and disappeared. Then Malayam&aacute;lin went to the
forest, and by the power of his asceticism he came to know the real

<h3 class="main">Story of the robber who won over Yama&rsquo;s
secretary.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in Sinhaladv&iacute;pa a robber,
of the name of Sinhavikrama, who since his birth had nourished his body
with other men&rsquo;s wealth stolen from every quarter. In time he
grew old, and desisting from his occupation, he reflected; &ldquo;What
resources have I in the other world? Whom shall I betake myself to for
protection there? If I betake myself to &#346;iva or Vish&#7751;u, what
value will they attach to me, when they have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>gods, hermits, and others to worship them? So I
will worship Chitragupta<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6982src" href=
"#xd27e6982" name="xd27e6982src">16</a> who alone records the good and
evil deeds of men. He may deliver me by his power. For he, being a
secretary, does alone the work of Brahm&aacute; and &#346;iva: he
writes down or erases in a moment the whole world, which is in his
hand.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, he began to devote himself to
Chitragupta; he honoured him specially, and in order to please him,
kept continually feeding Br&aacute;hmans.</p>
<p>While he was carrying on this system of conduct, one day Chitragupta
came to the house of that robber, in the form of a guest, to examine
into his real feelings. The robber received him courteously,
entertained him, and gave him a present, and then said to him,
&ldquo;Say this, &lsquo;May Chitragupta be propitious to
you&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then Chitragupta, who was disguised as a
Br&aacute;hman, said, &ldquo;Why do you neglect &#346;iva, and
Vish&#7751;u, and the other gods, and devote yourself to
Chitragupta?&rdquo; When the robber Sinhavikrama heard that, he said to
him, &ldquo;What business is that of yours. I do not need any other
gods but him.&rdquo; Then Chitragupta, wearing the form of a
Br&aacute;hman, went on to say to him, &ldquo;Well, if you will give me
your wife, I will say it.&rdquo; When Sinhavikrama heard that, he was
pleased, and said to him: &ldquo;I hereby give you my wife, in order to
please the god whom I have specially chosen for my own.&rdquo; When
Chitragupta heard that, he revealed himself to him and said, &ldquo;I
am Chitragupta himself, and I am pleased with you, so tell me what I am
to do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e6995" title=
"Source: Sinhav&iacute;krama">Sinhavikrama</span> was exceedingly
pleased and said to him, &ldquo;Holy one, take such order as that I
shall not die.&rdquo; Then Chitragupta said, &ldquo;Death is one from
whom it is impossible to guard people; but still I will devise a plan
to save you: listen to it. Ever since Death was consumed by &#346;iva,
being angry on account of &#346;veta, and was created again in this
world because he was required,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6998src"
href="#xd27e6998" name="xd27e6998src">17</a> wherever &#346;veta lives,
he abstains from injuring other people, as well as &#346;veta himself,
for he is restrained by the command of the god. And at present the
hermit &#346;veta is on the other side of the eastern ocean, in a grove
of ascetics beyond the river Tarangin&iacute;. That grove cannot be
invaded by Death, so I will take you and place you there. But you must
not return to this side of the Tarangin&iacute;. However, if you do
return out of carelessness, and Death seizes you, I will devise some
way of escape for you, when you have come to the other world.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Chitragupta had said this, he took the delighted Sinhavikrama,
and placed him in that grove of asceticism belonging to &#346;veta, and
then disappeared. And after some time Death went to the hither bank of
the river Tarangin&iacute;, to carry off Sinhavikrama<span class="corr"
title="Not in source">.</span> While there, he created by his delusive
power a heavenly nymph, and sent her to him, as he saw no other means
of getting hold of him. The fair one went and approached Sinhavikrama,
and artfully enslaved him, fascinating him with her wealth of beauty.
After some days had passed, she entered the Tarangin&iacute;, which was
disturbed with waves, giving out that she wished to see her relations.
And while Sinhavikrama, who had followed her, was looking at her from
the bank, she slipped in the middle of the river. And there she uttered
a piercing cry, as if she was being carried away by the stream,
exclaiming, &ldquo;My husband, can you see me carried away by the
stream without saving me? Are you a jackal in courage, and not a lion
as your name denotes?&rdquo; When Sinhavikrama heard that, he rushed
into the river, and the nymph pretended to be swept away by the
current, and when he followed her to save her, she soon led him to the
other bank. When he reached it, Death threw his noose over his neck,
and captured him; for destruction is ever impending over those whose
minds are captivated by objects of sense.</p>
<p>Then the careless Sinhavikrama was led off by Death to the hall of
Yama, and there Chitragupta, whose favour he had long ago won, saw him,
and said to him in private;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7014src" href=
"#xd27e7014" name="xd27e7014src">18</a> &ldquo;If you are asked here,
whether you will stay in hell first or in heaven, ask to be allowed to
take your period in heaven first. And while you live in heaven, acquire
merit, in order to ensure the permanence of your stay there. And then
perform severe asceticism, in order to expiate your sin.&rdquo; When
Chitragupta said this to Sinhavikrama, who was standing there abashed,
with face fixed on the ground, he readily consented to do it.</p>
<p>And a moment afterwards Yama said to Chitragupta, &ldquo;Has this
robber any amount of merit to his credit or not?&rdquo; Then
Chitragupta said, &ldquo;Indeed he is hospitable, and he bestowed his
own wife on a suitor, in order to please his favourite deity; so he has
to go to heaven for a day of the gods.&rdquo; When Yama heard this, he
said to Sinhavikrama; &ldquo;Tell me, which will you take first, your
happiness or your misery?&rdquo; Then Sinhavikrama entreated that he
might have his happiness first. So Yama ordered his chariot to be
brought, and Sinhavikrama mounted it, and went off to heaven,
remembering the words of Chitragupta.</p>
<p>There he rigidly observed a vow of bathing in the Ganges of heaven,
and of muttering prayers, and remained indifferent to the enjoyments of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>the place, and so he obtained the privilege of
dwelling there for another year of the gods. Thus in course of time he
obtained a right to perpetual residence in heaven, by virtue of his
severe asceticism, and by propitiating &#346;iva his sin was burnt up,
and he obtained knowledge. Then the messengers of hell were not able to
look him in the face, and Chitragupta blotted out the record of his sin
on his birch-bark register, and Yama was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus Sinhavikrama, though a robber, obtained emancipation by
virtue of true discernment; and now I have explained to you the
perfection of discernment. And thus, my son, the wise embark on these
six perfections taught by Buddha, as on a ship, and so cross the ocean
of temporal existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Soma&#347;&uacute;ra was being thus instructed in the forest
by king <span class="corr" id="xd27e7027" title=
"Source: Vinitamati">Vin&iacute;tamati</span>, who had attained the
rank of a Bodhisattva, the sun heard these religious lessons, and
became subdued, and assuming the hue of sunset as the red robe of a
Buddhist, entered the cavern of the western mountain. Then king
Vin&iacute;tamati and Soma&#347;&uacute;ra performed their evening
rites, according to pious usage, and spent the night there. And the
next day, Vin&iacute;tamati went on to teach Soma&#347;&uacute;ra the
law of Buddha with all its secrets.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7030src"
href="#xd27e7030" name="xd27e7030src">19</a> Then Soma&#347;&uacute;ra
built a hut at the foot of a tree, and remained there in the wood,
sitting at the feet of that instructor, absorbed in contemplation. And
in course of time those two, the teacher and the pupil, attained
supernatural powers, the result of abstraction, and gained the highest
illumination.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile, Indukala&#347;a came, out of jealousy, and by
the might of his sword and horse ejected his brother Kanakakala&#347;a
from the kingdom of Ahichchhatra also, which Vin&iacute;tamati gave
him, when he was afflicted at losing his first kingdom. He, having been
deposed from his throne, wandered about with two or three of his
ministers, and, as chance would have it, reached the grove, which was
the retreat of Vin&iacute;tamati. And while he was looking for fruits
and water, as he suffered from severe hunger and thirst, Indra burnt up
the wood by his magic power, and made it as it was before, wishing to
entrap Vin&iacute;tamati by making it impossible for him to shew such
hospitality to every wayfarer.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7041src"
href="#xd27e7041" name="xd27e7041src">20</a> And Vin&iacute;tamati,
beholding the grove, which was his retreat, suddenly turned into a
desert, roamed about hither and thither for a short time, in a state of
bewilderment. And then he saw Kanakala&#347;a, who in the course of his
wanderings had come there with his followers, and was now his guest,
and he and his train were all on the point of death from hunger. And
the hospitable Bodhisattva approached the king, when he was in this
state, and asked him his story, and then he exerted his discernment,
and said to him, &ldquo;Though this wood <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>has become a desert,
and affords no hospitable entertainment, still I can tell you an
expedient for saving your lives in your present state of hunger. Only
half a <i lang="sa-latn">kos</i> from here there is a deer, which has
been killed by falling into a hole, go and save your lives by eating
its flesh.&rdquo; His guest, who was suffering from hunger, took his
advice, and set out for that place with his followers, but the
Bodhisattva Vin&iacute;tamati got there before him. He reached that
hole, and by his supernatural power assumed the form of a deer, and
then he threw himself into it, and sacrificed his life for the sake of
his petitioner. Then Kanakakala&#347;a and his followers slowly reached
that hole, and found the deer lying dead in it. So they pulled it out,
and made a fire with grass and thorns, and roasted its flesh, and
devoured it all. In the meanwhile the Bodhisattva&rsquo;s two wives,
the daughter of the N&aacute;ga and the princess, seeing that the wood
of their retreat had been destroyed, and not seeing their husband, were
much distressed, and went and told what had happened, to
Soma&#347;&uacute;ra, whom they roused from deep meditation. He soon
discerned by contemplation what his spiritual teacher had done, and he
told the news to his wives, distressing as it was to them. And he
quickly went with them to that hole, in which his spiritual guide had
sacrificed himself for his guests. There the princess and the
N&aacute;ga&rsquo;s daughter, seeing that only the bones and horns of
the deer, into which their husband had turned himself, remained,
mourned for him. And the two ladies, who were devoted to their husband,
took his horns and bones, and brought a heap of wood from their
hermitage, and entered the fire. And then Kanakakala&#347;a and his
companions, who were there, being grieved when they heard the story,
entered the fire also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all this had taken place, Soma&#347;&uacute;ra, unable to
endure the grief, which he felt for the loss of his spiritual teacher,
took to a bed of <i>darbha</i>-grass with the intention of yielding up
his breath. And then Indra appeared to him in person and said to him,
&ldquo;Do not do so, for I did all this to try your spiritual teacher.
And I have now sprinkled with <i lang="sa-latn">am&#7771;ita</i> the
ashes and bones, which were all that remained of him, and his wives,
and his guests, and restored them all to life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7064src" href="#xd27e7064" name="xd27e7064src">21</a> When
Soma&#347;&uacute;ra heard Indra say this, he worshipped him, and rose
up delighted, and went and looked, and lo! his spiritual guide the
Bodhisattva Vin&iacute;tamati had risen up again alive, with his wives,
and Kanakakala&#347;a, and his attendants. Then he honoured with an
inclination of the head, and worshipped with gifts of flowers and
respectful speeches, his spiritual father, who had returned from the
other world with his wives, and feasted his eyes upon him. And while
Kanakakala&#347;a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"
name="pb191">191</a>]</span>and his followers were respectfully
testifying their devotion to him, all the gods came there, headed by
Brahm&aacute; and Vish&#7751;u. And pleased with the goodness of
Vin&iacute;tamati, they all gave him by their divine power boons earned
by his disinterestedness, and then disappeared. And
Soma&#347;&uacute;ra and the others told their history, and then
Vin&iacute;tamati went with them to another and a heavenly wood of
ascetics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that in this world even those who are reduced to
ashes meet again, much more men who are alive and can go where they
will. So, my son, no more of abandoning the body! Go, for you are a
brave man, and you shall certainly be re-united with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta.&rdquo; When I had heard this tale from the
old female ascetic, I bowed before her, and set out, sword in hand,
with renewed hope, and in course of time I reached this forest, and
was, as fate would have it, captured by these &#346;avaras, who were
seeking a victim for Durg&aacute;. And after wounding me in fight, they
bound me, and brought me as a prisoner to this king of the &#346;avaras
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u. Here I have found you, my sovereign,
accompanied by two or three of your ministers, and by your favour I am
as happy as if I were in my own house.</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who was in the palace of the
&#346;avara prince, had heard this history of the adventures of his
friend Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara told by himself, he was much pleased, and
after he had seen the proper remedies applied to the body of that
minister who had been wounded in fight, as the day was advancing, he
rose up with his other friends, and performed the duties of the
day.</p>
<p>And he remained there for some days engaged in restoring
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara to health, though eager to go to Ujjayin&iacute;,
in order to be re-united with his other friends and to obtain
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id=

lucky day for Ujjayin&iacute;, to find
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.</p>
<p>But his friend followed him a long way with his retinue, accompanied
by his ally Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha king of the M&aacute;tangas, and
made a promise to come to his assistance. And as he was going along
with his friends &#346;rutadhi, and Vimalabuddhi, and
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, and searching
for his other friends in that Vindhya forest, it happened that he slept
one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>day on the road with his ministers at the foot
of a certain tree. And he suddenly awoke, and got up, and looked about
him, and beheld there another man asleep. And when he uncovered his
face, he recognised him as his own minister Vichitrakatha, who had
arrived there. And Vichitrakatha too woke up, and saw his master
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, and joyfully embraced his feet. And the
prince embraced him, with eyes wide open with delight at seeing him so
unexpectedly, and all his ministers woke up and welcomed him. Then all
in turn told him their adventures, and asked him to tell his, and
Vichitrakatha began to relate his story as follows:</p>

<p class="first">At that time, when you were dispersed in all
directions by the curse of P&aacute;r&aacute;vat&aacute;ksha, I too in
my bewilderment wandered about alone for a long time. And after I had
roamed far, still unconscious, I suddenly reached in the course of the
next day, when I was tired out, a great and heavenly town on the
outskirts of the forest. There a godlike being, accompanied by two
consorts, beheld me, and had me bathed with cool water, and restored my
strength. And he made me enter his city, and carefully fed me with
heavenly food, then he ate himself, and those two wives of his ate
after him. And after the meal,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7095src"
href="#xd27e7095" name="xd27e7095src">1</a> being refreshed, I said to
him, &ldquo;Who are you, sir, and why have you thus saved the life of
me who am resolved on death? For I must certainly abandon the body, as
I have lost my master.&rdquo; When I had said this, I told him my whole
story. Then that noble and kind being said to me, &ldquo;I am a Yaksha,
these are my wives, and you have come here to-day as my guest, and you
know that it is the duty of householders to honour guests to the utmost
of their power. I have accordingly welcomed you. But why do you wish to
abandon the body? For this separation of yours is due to the curse of a
N&aacute;ga, and will last only a short time. And you will certainly be
all re-united, when the curse pronounced on you has spent its force.
And reflect, my good man; who is born free from sorrow in this world?
Hear what sorrow I have gone through, though I am a Yaksha.&rdquo;</p>

reflected,&mdash;&ldquo;Though I live up to the rules of my caste, I do

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on the confines of the southern region a
range of <i lang="sa-latn">tam&aacute;la</i> forests, dark with clouds
that obscure the sun, looking like the home of the monsoon. In it
dwells a famous Yaksha of the name of P&#7771;ith&uacute;dara, and I am
his only daughter, Saud&aacute;min&iacute; by name. My loving father
led me from one mighty mountain to another, and I was for ever amusing
myself in heavenly gardens.</p>
<p>And one day, as I was sporting on mount Kail&aacute;sa with my
friend Kapi&#347;abhr&uacute;, I saw a young Yaksha named
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa. He too, as he stood among his companions,
beheld me; and immediately our eyes were mutually attracted by one
another&rsquo;s beauty. When my father saw that, and ascertained that
the match would be no <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, he summoned
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa, and arranged our marriage. And after he
had fixed an auspicious day, he took me home, but
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa returned to his home with his friends in
high spirits. But the next day my friend Kapi&#347;abhr&uacute; came to
me with a downcast air, and when I questioned her, she was at length
induced to say this; &ldquo;Friend, I must tell you this bad news,
though it is a thing which should not be told. As I was coming to-day,
I saw your betrothed A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa in a garden named
Chitrasthala, on a plateau of the Him&aacute;layas, full of longing for
you. And his friends, in order to amuse him, made him in sport king of
the Yakshas, and they made his brother D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha personate
Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara his son, and they themselves became his
ministers. While your beloved was being solaced in this way by his
friends, Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara, who was roaming at will through the
air, saw him. And the son of the king of wealth, being enraged at what
he saw, summoned him, and cursed him in the following words;
&lsquo;Since, though a servant, you desire to pose as a lord, become a
mortal, you villain! As you wish to mount, fall<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7138" title="Not in source">!</span>&rsquo; When he laid this
curse on A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa, he answered despondingly,
&lsquo;Prince, I foolishly did this to dispel my longing, not through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>aspiring to any lofty rank, so have mercy upon
me.&rsquo; When Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara heard this sorrowful speech of
his, he ascertained by meditation that the case was so, and said to him
by way of fixing an end for the curse, &lsquo;You shall become a man,
and beget on that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, with whom you are in love,
your younger brother D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha by way of son,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7143src" href="#xd27e7143" name="xd27e7143src">5</a>
and so you shall be delivered from your curse, and obtain your own rank
once more, together with your wife, and this brother of yours shall be
born as your son, and after he has reigned on earth, he shall be
released from his curse.&rsquo; When the son of the god of wealth had
said this, A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa disappeared somewhere or other
by virtue of the curse. And when I saw that, my friend, I came here to
you grieved.&rdquo; When my friend said this to me, I was reduced to a
terrible state by grief, and after I had bewailed my lot, I went and
told it to my parents, and I spent that time in hope of a re-union with
my beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa born again as a
Br&aacute;hman, and I am that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, and we have been
thus united here, so we shall soon have a son born to us. When the
Br&aacute;hman Pavitradhara&rsquo;s wise wife Saud&aacute;min&iacute;
said this to him, he conceived the hope that he would have a son, and
was much delighted. And in course of time a son was born to him by that
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, whose birth cheered up their house and his mind.
And when Pavitradhara saw the face of that son, he immediately assumed
a celestial shape and became again the Yaksha
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa. And he said to that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;,
&ldquo;My dear, our curse is at an end. I have become
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa as before, come let us return to our own
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, his wife said to him, &ldquo;Think what is to
become of the child your brother, who through a curse has been born as
your son.&rdquo; When A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa heard that, he saw
what was to be done by means of his powers of contemplation, and said
to her; &ldquo;My dear, there is in this town a Br&aacute;hman of the
name of Devadar&#347;ana. He is poor in children and in wealth, and,
though he keeps up five fires, hunger makes two others burn more
fiercely, namely, the fire of digestion in his own stomach and in that
of his wife. And one day, as he was engaged in asceticism to obtain
wealth and a son, the holy god of fire, whom he was propitiating,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>said to him in a dream, &lsquo;You have not a
son of your own, but you shall have an adopted son, and by means of
him, Br&aacute;hman, your poverty shall come to an end.&rsquo; On
account of this revelation of the god of fire, the Br&aacute;hman is at
the present moment expecting that son, so we must give him this child
of ours, for this is the decree of fate.&rdquo; After
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa had said this to his beloved, he placed the
child on the top of a pitcher full of gold, and fastened round its neck
a garland of heavenly jewels, and deposited it in the house of that
Br&aacute;hman at night when he and his wife were asleep, and then went
with his beloved to his own place.</p>
<p>Then the Br&aacute;hman Devadar&#347;ana and his wife woke up, and
beheld that young moon of a child glittering with resplendent jewels,
and the Br&aacute;hman thought in his astonishment, &ldquo;What can be
the meaning of this?&rdquo; but when he saw the pot of gold, he
remembered what the god of fire had told him in his dream, and
rejoiced. And he took that young son given him by fate, and that
wealth, and in the morning he made a great feast. And on the eleventh
day he gave the child the appropriate name of
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7183src" href=
"#xd27e7183" name="xd27e7183src">6</a> Then the Br&aacute;hman
Devadar&#347;ana, having become very rich, remained performing his
sacrificial and other ceremonies, and enjoying the good things of this
world at the same time.</p>
<p>The brave &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana grew up in his father&rsquo;s
house, and acquired great skill in the Vedas and other branches of
learning, and in the use of weapons. But in course of time, when he had
grown up, his father Devadar&#347;ana, who had gone on a pilgrimage to
sacred bathing-places, died at Pray&aacute;ga. His mother, hearing of
that, entered the fire, and then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana mourned
for them, and performed on their behalf the ceremonies enjoined in the
sacred treatises. But in course of time his grief diminished, and as he
was not married, and had no relations, he became, though well educated,
devoted to gambling. And in a short time his wealth was consumed by
means of that vice, and he had difficulty in obtaining even food.</p>
<p>One day, after he had remained in the gambling-hall without food for
three days, being unable to go out for shame, as he had not got a
decent garment to wear, and refusing to eat the food which others gave
him, a certain gambler, named Mukharaka, who was a friend of his, said
to him, &ldquo;Why are you so utterly overwhelmed? Do you not know that
such is the nature of the sinful vice of gambling? Do you not know that
the dice are the sidelong loving looks of the goddess of Ill Luck? Has
not Providence ordained for you the usual lot of the gambler? His arms
are his only clothing, the dust is his bed, the cross-roads are his
house, ruin is his wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7192src" href=

food? Why do you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"

man? For what object of desire is there that a resolute man cannot

<h3 class="main">Story of Bh&uacute;nandana.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is here a region named Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra, the
ornament of the earth, which the Creator made as a second heaven, after
creating the first heaven, for men who have done righteous deeds. The
difference between the two is that in heaven delights can only be seen,
in Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra they can be actually enjoyed. The two glorious
goddesses &#346;r&iacute; and Sarasvat&iacute; both frequent it, as if
they vied with one another, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I have the
pre&euml;minence here&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, it is I.&rdquo;&mdash;The
Him&aacute;laya encircles it with its embrace, as if to prevent Kali,
the adversary of virtue, from entering it. The Vitast&aacute; adorns
it, and repels sin with its waves, as if they were hands, and seems to
say, &ldquo;Depart far from this land which is full of waters sacred to
the gods.&rdquo; In it the long lines of lofty palaces, whitened with
silvery plaster, imitate the cliffs at the foot of the neighbouring
Him&aacute;laya. In this land there lived a king, named
Bh&uacute;nandana, who upheld as a spiritual guide the system of the
castes and the prescribed stages of life, learned in science and
traditional lore, the moon that delighted his subjects. His valour was
displayed in the kingdoms of his foes, on which he left the impress of
his nails. He was a politic governor, and his people were ever free
from calamity; he was exclusively devoted to K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and
the minds of his people took no pleasure in vicious deeds.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7214src" href="#xd27e7214" name=
"xd27e7214src">8</a></p>
<p>Once on a time, on the twelfth day of the month, the king, after
duly worshipping Vish&#7751;u, saw in a dream a Daitya maiden approach
him. When he woke up, he could not see her, and in his astonishment he
said to himself, &ldquo;This is no mere dream; I suspect she is some
celestial nymph by whom I have been cajoled.&rdquo; Under this
impression he remained thinking of her, and so grieved at being
deprived of her society, that gradually he neglected all his duties as
a king. Then that king, not seeing any way of recovering her, said to
himself; &ldquo;My brief union with her was due to the favour of
Vish&#7751;u, so I will go into a solitary place and propitiate
Vish&#7751;u with a view to recovering her, and I will abandon this
clog of a kingdom, which without her is distasteful.&rdquo; After
saying this, king Bh&uacute;nandana informed his subjects of his
resolution, and gave the kingdom to his younger brother named
Sunandana.</p>
<p>But after he had resigned the kingdom, he went to a holy
bathing-place named Kramasaras; which arose from the footfall of
Vish&#7751;u, for it was made by him long ago in his Dwarf incarnation.
It is attended by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197"
name="pb197">197</a>]</span>the three gods Brahm&aacute;, Vish&#7751;u,
and &#346;iva, who have settled on the top of the neighbouring
mountains in the form of peaks. And the foot of Vish&#7751;u created
here in Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra another Ganges, named Ikshuvat&iacute;, as
if in emulation of the Vitast&aacute;. There the king remained,
performing austerities, and pining, without desire for any other
enjoyment, like the <i lang="sa-latn">ch&aacute;taka</i> in the hot
season longing for fresh rainwater.</p>
<p>And after twelve years had passed over his head, while he remained
engaged in ascetic practices, a certain ascetic came that way who was a
chief of sages: he had yellow matted hair, wore tattered garments, and
was surrounded by a band of pupils; and he appeared like &#346;iva
himself come down from the top of the hills that overhang that holy
bathing-place. As soon as he saw the king, he was filled with love for
him, and went up to him, and bowing before him, asked him his history,
and then reflected for a moment and said; &ldquo;King, that Daitya
maiden that you love lives in <span class="corr" id="xd27e7228" title=
"Source: P&aacute;&#7789;&aacute;la">P&aacute;t&aacute;la</span>, so be
of good cheer, I will take you to her. For I am a Br&aacute;hman named
Bh&uacute;rivasu, the son of a sacrificing Br&aacute;hman of the
Dekkan, named Yajuh&#803;, and I am a chief among magicians. My father
communicated his knowledge to me, and I learnt from a treatise on
P&aacute;t&aacute;la the proper charms and ceremonies for propitiating
H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;&aacute;na.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7231src" href="#xd27e7231" name="xd27e7231src">9</a> And I went
to &#346;r&iacute;parvata and performed a course of asceticism there
for propitiating &#346;iva, and &#346;iva, being pleased with it,
appeared to me and said to me,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go; after you have married a Daitya maiden and enjoyed
pleasures in the regions below the earth, you shall return to me; and
listen; I will tell you an expedient for obtaining those delights.
There are on this earth many openings leading to the lower regions; but
there is one great and famous one in Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra made by Maya,
by which Ush&aacute; the daughter of B&aacute;&#7751;a introduced her
lover Aniruddha into the secret pleasure-grounds of the D&aacute;navas,
and made him happy there. And Pradyumna, in order to deliver his son,
laid it open, making a door in one place with the peak of a mountain,
and he placed Durg&aacute; there, under the name of
&#346;&aacute;rik&aacute;, to guard that door, after propitiating her
with hundreds of praises. Consequently even now the place is called by
the two names of Peak of Pradyumna and Hill of
&#346;&aacute;rik&aacute;. So go and enter P&aacute;t&aacute;la with
your followers by that famous opening, and by my favour you shall
succeed there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the god had said this, he disappeared, and by his favour
I acquired all knowledge at once, and now I have come to this land of
Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra. So come with us, king, to that seat of
&#346;&aacute;rik&aacute;, in order that I may conduct you to
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, to the maid that you love.&rdquo; When the
ascetic had said this to king Bh&uacute;nandana, the latter consented
and went with him to that seat of &#346;&aacute;rik&aacute;. There he
bathed in the Vitast&aacute;, and worshipped Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and
honoured the goddess &#346;&aacute;rik&aacute;, and performed the
ceremony <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>of averting evil spirits from all quarters by
waving the hand round the head,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7240src"
href="#xd27e7240" name="xd27e7240src">10</a> and other ceremonies. And
then the great ascetic, triumphing by the favour of the boon of
&#346;iva, revealed the opening by scattering mustard-seeds in the
prescribed manner, and the king entered with him and his pupils, and
marched along the road to P&aacute;t&aacute;la for five days and five
nights.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7243src" href="#xd27e7243" name=
"xd27e7243src">11</a> And on the sixth day they all crossed the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e7246" title=
"Source: Gang&aacute;">Ganges</span> of the lower regions, and they
beheld a heavenly grove on a silver plain. It had splendid coral,
camphor, sandal, and aloes trees, and was perfumed with the fragrance
of large full-blown golden lotuses. And in the middle of it they saw a
lofty temple of &#346;iva. It was of vast extent, adorned with stairs
of jewels; its walls were of gold, it glittered with many pillars of
precious stone; and the spacious translucent body of the edifice was
built of blocks of the moon-gem.</p>
<p>Then king Bh&uacute;nandana and the pupils of that ascetic, who
possessed supernatural insight, were cheered, and he said to them,
&ldquo;This is the dwelling of the god &#346;iva, who inhabits the
lower regions in the form of H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;vara, and whose
praises are sung in the three worlds, so worship him.&rdquo; Then they
all bathed in the Ganges of the lower regions, and worshipped &#346;iva
with various flowers, the growth of P&aacute;t&aacute;la. And after the
brief refreshment of worshipping &#346;iva, they went on and reached a
splendid lofty <i lang="sa-latn">jambu</i>-tree, the fruits of which
were ripe and falling on the ground. And when the ascetic saw it, he
said to them; &ldquo;You must not eat the fruits of this tree, for, if
eaten, they will impede the success of what you have in hand.&rdquo; In
spite of his prohibition one of his pupils, impelled by hunger, ate a
fruit of the tree, and, as soon as he had eaten it, he became rigid and
motionless.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7254src" href="#xd27e7254" name=
"xd27e7254src">12</a></p>
<p>Then the other pupils, seeing that, were terrified, and no longer
felt any desire to eat the fruit; and that ascetic, accompanied by them
and king Bh&uacute;nandana, went on only a <i>cos</i> further, and
beheld a lofty golden wall rising before them, with a gate composed of
a precious gem. On the two sides of the gate they saw two rams with
bodies of iron, ready to strike with their horns, put there to prevent
any one from entering. But the ascetic suddenly struck them a blow on
their heads with a charmed wand, and drove them off somewhere, as if
they had been struck by a thunderbolt. Then he and his pupils and that
king entered by that gate, and beheld splendid palaces of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>gold
and gems. And at the door of every one they beheld warders terrible
with many teeth and tusks,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7270src" href=
"#xd27e7270" name="xd27e7270src">13</a> with iron maces in their hands.
And then they all sat down there under a tree, while the ascetic
entered into a mystic contemplation to avert evil. And by means of that
contemplation all those terrible warders were compelled to flee from
all the doors, and disappeared.</p>
<p>And immediately there issued from those doors lovely women with
heavenly ornaments and dresses, who were the attendants of those Daitya
maidens. They approached separately all there present, the ascetic
among them, and invited them in the name of their mistresses into their
respective palaces. And the ascetic, having now succeeded in his
enterprise, said to all the others,&mdash;&ldquo;You must none of you
disobey the command of your beloved after entering her palace.&rdquo;
Then he entered with a few of those attendants a splendid palace, and
obtained a lovely Daitya maiden and the happiness he desired. And the
others singly were introduced into magnificent palaces by other of the
attendants, and were blessed with the love of Daitya maidens.</p>
<p>And the king Bh&uacute;nandana was then conducted by one of the
attendants, who bowed respectfully to him, to a palace built of gems
outside the wall. Its walls of precious stone were, so to speak,
adorned all round with living pictures, on account of the reflections
on them of the lovely waiting-women. It was built on a platform of
smooth sapphire, and so it appeared as if it had ascended to the vault
of heaven, in order to outdo a sky-going chariot.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7286src" href="#xd27e7286" name="xd27e7286src">14</a> It seemed
like the house of the Vrish&#7751;is,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7292src" href="#xd27e7292" name="xd27e7292src">15</a> made rich
by means of the power of Vish&#7751;u. In it sported fair ones wild
with intoxication, and it was full of the charming grace of Cupid. Even
a flower, that cannot bear the wind and the heat, would in vain attempt
to rival the delicacy of the bodies of the ladies in that palace. It
resounded with heavenly music, and when the king entered it, he beheld
once more that beautiful Asura maiden, whom he had seen in a dream. Her
beauty illuminated the lower world which has not the light of the sun
or the stars, and made the creation of sparkling jewels and other
lustrous things, an unnecessary proceeding on the part of the

<p>The king gazed with tears of joy on that indescribably beautiful
lady, and, so to speak, washed off from his eyes the pollution, which
they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>contracted by looking at others. And that girl,
named Kumudin&iacute;, who was being praised by the songs of female
attendants,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7312src" href="#xd27e7312" name=
"xd27e7312src">17</a> felt indescribable joy when she saw the prince.
She rose up, and took him by the hand and said to him, &ldquo;I have
caused you much suffering,&rdquo; and then with all politeness she
conducted him to a seat. And after he had rested a little while, he
bathed, and the Asura maiden had him adorned with robes and jewels, and
led him out to the garden to drink. Then she sat down with him on the
brink of a tank filled with wine, and with the blood and fat of
corpses, that hung from trees on its banks, and she offered that king a
goblet, full of that fat and wine, to drink, but he would not accept
the loathsome compound. And she kept earnestly saying to the
king<span class="corr" id="xd27e7334" title="Source: ;">:</span>
&ldquo;You will not prosper if you reject my beverage.&rdquo; But he
answered, &ldquo;I certainly will not drink that undrinkable compound,
whatever may happen.&rdquo; Then she emptied the goblet on his head and
departed; and the king&rsquo;s eyes and mouth were suddenly closed, and
her maids took him and flung him into the water of another tank.</p>
<p>And the moment he was thrown into the water, he found himself once
more in the grove of ascetics, near the holy bathing-place of
Kramasaras, where he was before.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7339src"
href="#xd27e7339" name="xd27e7339src">18</a> And when he saw the
mountain there, as it were, laughing at him with its snows,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7342src" href="#xd27e7342" name=
"xd27e7342src">19</a> the disappointed king, despondent, astonished,
and bewildered, reflected as follows<span class="corr" id="xd27e7345"
title="Source: ;">:</span> &ldquo;What a difference there is between
the garden of the Daitya maiden and this mountain of Kramasaras.<a id=
"xd27e7348" name="xd27e7348"></a> Ah! what is this strange event? Is it
an illusion or a wandering of the mind? But what other explanation can
there be than this, that undoubtedly this has befallen me, because,
though I heard the warning of the ascetic, I disobeyed the injunction
of that fair one. And after all the beverage was not loathsome; she was
only making trial of me; for the liquor, which fell upon my head, has
bestowed on it heavenly fragrance. So it is indubitable that, in the
case of the unfortunate, even great hardships endured bring no reward,
for Destiny is opposed to them.&rdquo; While king Bh&uacute;nandana was
engaged in these reflections, bees came and surrounded him on account
of the fragrant perfume of his body, that had been sprinkled with the
liquor offered by the Asura maiden. When those bees stung the king, he
thought to himself, &ldquo;Alas! so far from my toils having produced
the desired fruit, they have produced disagreeable results, as the
raising of a Vet&aacute;la does to a man of little
courage.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7350src" href="#xd27e7350"
name="xd27e7350src">20</a> Then he became so distracted that he
resolved on suicide. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>And it happened that, at that very time, there came a young hermit
that way, who, finding the king in this state, and being of a merciful
disposition, went up to him and quickly drove away the bees, and after
asking him his story, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;King, as long as we
retain this body, how can woes come to an end? So the wise should
always pursue without distraction the great object of human existence.
And until you perceive that Vish&#7751;u, &#346;iva, and Brahm&aacute;
are really one, you will always find the successes, that are gained by
worshipping them separately, short-lived and uncertain. So meditate on
Brahm&aacute;, Vish&#7751;u, and &#346;iva, in the light of their
unity, and patiently perform asceticism here for another twelve years.
Then you shall obtain that beloved, and eventually everlasting
salvation; and observe, you have already attained a body possessing
heavenly fragrance. Now receive from me this skin of a black antelope,
to which a charm is attached, and if you wrap yourself up in it, you
will not be annoyed here by bees.&rdquo; When the hermit had said this,
he gave him the deer-skin and the charm, and departed; and the king
accepted his advice, and taking to himself patience, so lived in that
place. And after the king had lived there twelve years, and propitiated
&#346;iva by penance, that Daitya maiden, named Kumudin&iacute;, came
to him of her own accord. And the king went with that beloved to
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and after he had lived with her a long time in
happiness, he attained salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So those fortunate ones, whose characters are free from
perturbation, and who betake themselves to patient endurance, obtain
again their own rank, though they may have fallen far from it.<a class=

are a man fated to be prosperous, being covered with auspicious marks,
why do you, out of perturbation, allow yourself to go without
food?&rdquo; When <span class="corr" id="xd27e7371" title=
"Source: &#346;ridar&#347;ana">&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana</span>, who
was fasting, was thus addressed in the gambling-hall by his friend
Mukharaka, he said to him, &ldquo;What you say, is true, but being a
man of good family, I cannot for shame go out into this town, as I am
reduced so low by gambling. So if you will permit me, my friend, to go
to some other country this very night, I will take food.&rdquo; When
Mukharaka heard that, he consented, and brought food and gave it to
him, and he ate it. And after <span class="corr" id="xd27e7374" title=
"Source: &#346;ridar&#347;ana">&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana</span> had
eaten it, he set out for another country with that friend of his, who
followed him out of affection.</p>
<p>And as he was going along the road at night, it happened that the
two Yakshas, A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa and Saud&aacute;min&iacute;,
his father and mother, who had deposited him, as soon as he was born,
in the house of the Br&aacute;hman, saw him while they were roaming
through the air. When they saw him in distress, impoverished by the
vice of gambling, and on his way to a foreign country, affection made
them say to him, while still remaining invisible, the following
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>words; &ldquo;&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, your
mother, the wife of Devadar&#347;ana, buried in her house some jewels.
Take those, and do not omit to go with them to M&aacute;lava, for there
is a magnificent prince there of the name of &#346;r&iacute;sena. And
since he was much afflicted in his youth by miseries arising from
gambling, he has made a large and glorious asylum for gamblers. There
gamblers live, and are fed with whatever food they desire. So go there,
darling, and you shall be prosperous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana heard this speech from heaven, he
went back to his house with his friend, and found those ornaments in
it, in a hole in the ground. Then he set out delighted for
M&aacute;lava, with his friend, thinking that the gods had shewn him
favour. So in that night and the succeeding day he went a long
distance, and the next evening he reached with his friend a village
named Bahusasya. And being weary, he sat down with his friend on the
bank of a translucent lake, not far from that village. While he
remained for a brief period on the bank of that lake, after washing his
feet and drinking water, there came there a certain maiden, matchless
in beauty, to fetch water. Her body resembled a blue lotus in colour,
and she seemed like Rati left alone, and blackened by the smoke from
the body of the god of Love, when he had just been consumed by
&#346;iva. &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana was delighted to behold her, and
she went up to him, and looked at him with an eye full of love, and
said to him and his friend, &ldquo;Worthy sirs, why have you come
hither to your death? Why, through ignorance, have you fallen like
moths into burning fire?&rdquo; When Mukharaka heard this, he said to
the maiden, without the least trepidation, &ldquo;Who are you? And what
is the meaning of what you say? Tell us.&rdquo; Then she said,
&ldquo;Listen both of you! I will tell you the whole story in few
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a large and famous royal grant to Br&aacute;hmans,
named Sughosha. In it there dwelt a Br&aacute;hman named Padmagarbha,
who possessed a thorough knowledge of the Vedas. He had a wife of very
good family, named &#346;asikal&aacute;. And the Br&aacute;hman had two
children by that wife, a son of the name of Mukharakha, and myself a
daughter of the name of Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;. My brother Mukharaka
was ruined by the vice of gambling in early youth, and left his home
and went off to some other country. My mother died of grief on that
account, and my father, afflicted with two sorrows, abandoned the state
of a householder. And he roamed about from place to place, with no
other companion than myself, to look for that son, and, as it happened,
he reached this village. Now in this village there lives a great
bandit, the chief of a gang of robbers, called Vasubh&uacute;ti, a
Br&aacute;hman only by name. When my father arrived here, that ruffian,
with the help of his servants, killed him, and took away the gold that
he had about his person. And he made me a prisoner and carried me off
to his house, and he has made arrangements to give me in marriage to
his son Subh&uacute;ti. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>his son has gone off somewhere to
plunder a caravan, and, owing to my good fortune, the result of good
deeds in a former birth, he has not yet returned; now it remains for
Destiny to dispose of me. But, if this bandit were to see you, he would
certainly do you some violence: so think of some artifice by which you
may escape him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the maiden said this, Mukharaka recognized her, and at once
clasping her round the neck, said to her, &ldquo;Alas, my sister
Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;! I am that very brother of yours Mukharaka, the
murderer of his relations. Alas! wretched that I am, I am
ruined.&rdquo; When Padmish&#7789;h&aacute; heard this, and saw her
elder brother, pity caused her to be, as it were, suddenly encircled
with all sorrows. Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana comforted the
brother and sister, who were lamenting their parents, and addressed a
timely admonition and encouragement to them. He said, &ldquo;This is
not the time for lamentation, we must now save our lives even at the
cost of our wealth, and by means of it we must protect ourselves
against this bandit.&rdquo; When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana said this,
they checked their grief with self-control, and all three agreed
together what each was to do.</p>
<p>Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e7391" title=
"Source: &#346;ridar&#347;ana">&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana</span>,
being thin by reason of his former fasts, flung himself down on the
bank of that tank, and pretended to be ill. And Mukharaka remained
holding his feet and weeping: but Padmish&#7789;h&aacute; immediately
repaired to that bandit chief, and said, &ldquo;A traveller has
arrived, and is lying ill on the border of the tank, and there is
another there who is his servant.&rdquo; When the bandit chief heard
that, he sent some of his followers there. They went, and seeing the
two men as had been described, asked Mukharaka why he wept so much for
his companion. When Mukharaka heard this, he said with affected
sorrow<span class="corr" id="xd27e7394" title="Source: ;">,</span>
&ldquo;This Br&aacute;hman, who is my elder brother, left his native
land to visit holy bathing-places, but was attacked by disease, and
slowly travelling along he has arrived here, accompanied by me. And the
moment he got here, he became incapable of movement, and he said to me,
&lsquo;Rise up, my dear brother, and quickly prepare for me a bed of
<i lang="sa-latn">darbha</i>-grass. And fetch me some virtuous
Br&aacute;hman from this village. On him I will bestow all my wealth,
for I cannot live through this night.&rsquo; When he said this to me in
this foreign country after sunset, I felt quite puzzled as to what I
ought to do, and, being afflicted, I had recourse to weeping. So bring
here some Br&aacute;hman while he is alive, in order that he may bestow
on him with his own hand whatever wealth we possess. For he will
certainly not live through the night, and I shall not be able to
survive the sorrow of his loss, so to-morrow I shall enter the fire. So
do for us this which we ask, since we have met with you here as
compassionate men and friends without any cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bandits heard that, pity arose in their minds, and they
went and told the story, exactly as they had heard it, to their master
Vasubh&uacute;ti, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span>and went on to say<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7404" title="Source: ;">,</span> &ldquo;So come and receive, as a
pious gift, from this Br&aacute;hman, who is eager to bestow it on you,
the wealth which ordinarily is to be obtained only by killing its
possessor.&rdquo; When they said this to Vasubh&uacute;ti, he said,
&ldquo;What course is this which you suggest? It is highly impolitic
for us to take wealth without killing its possessor, for, if he is
deprived of his wealth, without being killed, he will certainly do us
an injury.&rdquo; When the villain said this, those servants answered
him, &ldquo;What is there to fear in this? There is some difference
between taking wealth by force, and receiving it as a pious gift from a
dying man. Besides, to-morrow morning we will kill those two
Br&aacute;hmans, if they are still alive. Otherwise, what is the use of
incurring needlessly the guilt of killing a Br&aacute;hman?&rdquo; When
Vasubh&uacute;ti heard this, he consented, and in the night he came to
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana to receive his pious gift, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e7407" title=
"Source: &#346;ridar&#347;ana">&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana</span>
concealed a part of his mother&rsquo;s ornaments, and gave him the
rest, assuming a faltering voice. Then the bandit, having got what he
wanted, returned home with his followers.</p>
<p>Then Padmish&#7789;h&aacute; came at night to
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana and Mukharaka, while the bandits were
asleep. Then they quickly deliberated together, and set off at once
from that place for M&aacute;lava by a path not frequented by the
robbers. And during that night they went a long distance, and reached a
wood that seemed to be afraid of the roaring lions, tigers, and other
wild beasts within it. It seemed by its thorns to be in a state of
perpetual horripilation, and by its roaming black antelopes to be
rolling its eyes. The dry creepers shewed that its body was dried up
from fear, and the shrill whistling of the loose bark was its screams
of terror. And while they were journeying through that forest, the sun,
that had observed their sufferings all day, withdrew its light, as if
in compassion, and set. Then they sat down weary and hungry at the foot
of a tree, and in the early part of the night they saw in the distance
a light, as of fire. And &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana said, &ldquo;Can
there possibly be a village here? I will go and look.&rdquo; So he went
in the direction of the light. And when he reached it, and looked at
it, lo! it was a great palace built of jewels, and its splendour
produced that light as of fire.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7412src"
href="#xd27e7412" name="xd27e7412src">22</a> And he saw inside it a
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; of heavenly beauty, surrounded by many Yakshas,
with feet turned the wrong way and squinting eyes. And the brave man,
seeing that they had brought there all kinds of meat and drink, went up
to the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, and asked her to give him his share as a
guest. And she was pleased with his courage and gave him what he asked
for, enough food and water to satisfy himself and his two companions.
The refreshment was placed on the back of a Yaksha ordered off by her
for that duty, and &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana returned with it to his
friend and Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;. And then he dismissed the Yaksha,
and partook there with them of all that splendid food <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>of
various kinds, and drank pure cold water. Then Mukharaka was pleased,
perceiving that he must be an incarnation of a divinity, as he was so
rich in courage and might, and, desiring his own prosperity, he said to
him, &ldquo;You are some incarnation of a divinity, and this sister of
mine Padmish&#7789;h&aacute; is the greatest beauty in the world, so I
now give her to you as a wife meet for you.&rdquo; When
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana heard that, he was delighted, and said to
his friend, &ldquo;I accept with joy this offer of yours which I have
long desired. But when I reach my goal I will marry her in proper
form.&rdquo; This he said to those two, and then passed the night in a
joyful state of mind. And the next morning they all set out from that
place, and reached in due course the city of that king
&#346;r&iacute;sena, the sovereign of M&aacute;lava. And arriving
tired, they immediately entered the house of an old Br&aacute;hman
woman to rest. And in the course of conversation they told her their
story and their names, and then they saw that the old woman was much
disturbed, and when they questioned her, she said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the well-born wife of a Br&aacute;hman here, named
Satyavrata, who was a servant of the king&rsquo;s, and my name is
Ya&#347;asvat&iacute;. And after my husband died, the compassionate
king gave me the fourth part of his salary to live upon, as I had not a
son to support me. But now this moon of kings, though his virtues are
great, and though he is generous enough to give away the whole world,
has been seized by a consumption<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7425src"
href="#xd27e7425" name="xd27e7425src">23</a> which the physicians
cannot cure. And the drugs and charms of those skilled in such things
do not prevail against it; but a certain enchanter made this promise in
his presence, &lsquo;If I could only get a hero, equal to the task, to
help me, I would certainly put an end to this illness by getting a
Vet&aacute;la into my power.&rsquo; Then proclamation was made by beat
of drum, but no such hero was found. Then the king gave the following
order to his ministers; &lsquo;You must look out for some daring
gambler, who comes to reside in the great and well-known asylum, which
I built for such. For gamblers are reckless, abandoning wife and
relations, fearless, sleeping at the foot of trees and in other exposed
places, like ascetics.&rsquo; When the king gave this order to his
ministers, they instructed to this effect the superintendent of the
asylum, and he is now on the lookout for some brave man who may come
there to reside awhile. Now you are gamblers, and if you,
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, feel able to accomplish the undertaking, I
will take you to-day to that asylum. And you will be well treated by
the king, and you will confer a benefit on me, for grief is killing
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old lady said this, &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana answered
her, &ldquo;Agreed! I am able to accomplish this, so lead me quickly to
that asylum.&rdquo; When she heard this, she took him, and
Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;, and Mukharaka, to that asylum, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>and
there said to the superintendent, &ldquo;Here is a Br&aacute;hman
gambler arrived from a foreign land, a hero who is able to assist that
enchanter in performing incantations for the good of the king.&rdquo;
When the superintendent heard this, he questioned
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, and when he confirmed the words of the old
lady, he treated him with great respect, and led him quickly into the
presence of the king.</p>
<p>And &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, being introduced by him, beheld the
king, who was thin and pale as the new moon. And the king
&#346;r&iacute;sena observed that &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, who
bowed before him and sat down, was of a taking appearance, and pleased
with his look, he felt comforted, and said to him, &ldquo;I know that
your exertions will certainly put an end to my disease; my body tells
me this, for the mere sight of you has quieted its sufferings. So aid
the enchanter in this matter.&rdquo; When the king said this,
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana said to him &ldquo;The enterprise is a mere
trifle.&rdquo; Then the king summoned the enchanter and said to him,
&ldquo;This hero will aid you; do what you said.&rdquo; When that
enchanter heard that, he said to &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir, if you are able to assist me in raising a
Vet&aacute;la, come to me in the cemetery at night-fall this very day,
the fourteenth of the black fortnight.&rdquo; When the ascetic, who
practised magic, had said this, he went away, and
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana took leave of the king and returned to that
asylum.</p>
<p>There he took food with <span class="corr" id="xd27e7438" title=
"Source: Padmis&#7789;h&aacute;">Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;</span> and
Mukharaka, and at night he went alone, sword in hand, to the cemetery.
It was full of many ghosts, empty of men, inauspicious, full of roaring
jackals, covered with impenetrable darkness, but shewed in some places
a faint gleam where the funeral pyres were.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7441src" href="#xd27e7441" name="xd27e7441src">24</a> The hero
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana wandered about in that place of horrors and
saw the enchanter in the middle of it. His whole body was smeared with
ashes, he had a Br&aacute;hmanical thread of hair, he wore a turban
made of the clothes of the dead, and he was clad in a black garment.
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana approached him, and made himself known to
him, and then girding up his loins, he said, &ldquo;Tell me, what shall
I do for you?&rdquo; The enchanter answered in high spirits,
&ldquo;Half a <i>cos</i> only to the west of this place there is an
A&#347;oka tree, the leaves of which are burnt with the hot flame of
funeral pyres. At the foot of it there is a corpse, go and bring it
here unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana said, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and
going quickly to the place he saw some one else taking away the corpse.
So he ran and tried to drag it from the shoulder of that person, who
would not let it go, and said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Let go this corpse:
where are you taking my friend whom I have to burn?&rdquo; Then that
second person said to &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, &ldquo;I will not
let the dead man go; I am his friend; what have you to do with
him?&rdquo; While they were dragging the corpse from one
another&rsquo;s shoulders, and making these mutual recriminations,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>the corpse itself, which was animated by a
Vet&aacute;la, uttered a terrible shriek. That terrified the second
person so that his heart broke, and he fell down dead, and then
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana went off with that corpse in his arms. Then
the second man, though dead, rose up, being possessed by a
Vet&aacute;la, and tried to stop &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, and said
to him, &ldquo;Halt! do not go off with my friend on your
shoulder.&rdquo; Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, knowing that his
rival was possessed by a Vet&aacute;la, said to him, &ldquo;What proof
is there that you are his friend? He is my friend.&rdquo; The rival
then said, &ldquo;The corpse itself shall decide between us.&rdquo;
Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, said, &ldquo;Well! let him declare
who is his friend.&rdquo; Then the corpse, that was on his back, being
possessed by a Vet&aacute;la, said, &ldquo;I am hungry, so I decide
that whoever gives me food is my friend; let him take me where he
likes.&rdquo; When the second corpse, that was also possessed by a
Vet&aacute;la, heard this, he answered,&mdash;&ldquo;I have no food; if
he has any, let him give you some.&rdquo; &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana,
hearing this, said, <span class="corr" id="xd27e7454" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>I will give him food,&rdquo; and
proceeded to strike with his sword at the second corpse, in order to
procure food for the Vet&aacute;la that was on his shoulder.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7457src" href="#xd27e7457" name=
"xd27e7457src">25</a> But that second corpse, which was also possessed
by a Vet&aacute;la, the moment he began to strike it, disappeared by
its supernatural power.</p>
<p>Then the Vet&aacute;la, that was on
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana&rsquo;s shoulder, said to him, &ldquo;Now
give me the food that you promised me.&rdquo; So
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, not being able to obtain any other flesh
to give him to eat, cut off with his sword some of his own flesh, and
gave it to him. This pleased the Vet&aacute;la, and he said to him,
&ldquo;I am satisfied with you, brave man, let your body be restored
whole as before. Now take me off; this enterprise of yours shall
succeed, but that ascetic enchanter shall be destroyed, for he is a
great coward.&rdquo; When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana was thus
addressed by the Vet&aacute;la, he immediately became whole as before,
and taking the corpse he handed it to that magician. And he received it
joyfully, and honoured it with unguents and garlands of blood, and he
placed the corpse, possessed by the Vet&aacute;la, on its back in a
great circle marked out with powdered human bones, in the corners of
which were placed pitchers of blood, and which was lighted up with
lamps fed by oil from the human body. And he sat on the breast of the
corpse, and holding in his hand a ladle and spoon of human bone, he
began to make an oblation of clarified butter in its mouth. Immediately
such a flame issued from the mouth of that corpse possessed by the
Vet&aacute;la, that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>sorcerer rose up in terror and
fled. When he thus lost his presence of mind, and dropped his spoon and
ladle; the Vet&aacute;la pursued him, and opening his mouth swallowed
him whole.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7476src" href="#xd27e7476" name=
"xd27e7476src">26</a></p>
<p>When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana saw that, he lifted up his sword
and attacked the Vet&aacute;la, but the Vet&aacute;la said to him,
&ldquo;&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, I am pleased with this courage of
yours, so take these mustard-seeds produced in my mouth. If you place
these on the head and hands of the king, the malady of consumption will
immediately leave him, and you in a short time will become the king of
the whole earth.&rdquo; When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana heard this, he
said, &ldquo;How can I leave this place without that
sorcerer<span class="corr" id="xd27e7492" title="Source: .">?</span>
The king is sure to say that I killed him out of a selfish regard to my
own interests.&rdquo; When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana said this to the
Vet&aacute;la, he answered, &ldquo;I will tell you a convincing proof,
which will clear you. Cut open the body of this corpse, and shew inside
it this sorcerer dead, whom I have swallowed.&rdquo; When the
Vet&aacute;la had said this, he gave him the mustard-seeds, and went
off somewhere or other, leaving that corpse, and the corpse fell on the
ground.</p>
<p>Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana went off, taking with him the
mustard-seeds, and he spent that night in the asylum in which his
friend was. And the next morning he went to the king, and told him what
had happened in the night, and took and shewed to the ministers that
sorcerer in the stomach of the corpse. Then he placed the mustard-seeds
on the head and the hand of the king, and that made the king quite
well, as all his sickness at once left him. Then the king was pleased,
and, as he had no son, he adopted as his son
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, who had saved his life. And he immediately
anointed that hero crown-prince; for the seed of benefits, sown in good
soil, produces abundant fruit. Then the fortunate
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana married there that <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7497" title=
"Source: Padmis&#7789;h&aacute;">Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;</span>, who
seemed like the goddess of Fortune that had come to him in reward for
his former courting of her, and the hero remained there in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>company of her brother Mukharaka, enjoying
pleasures and ruling the earth.</p>
<p>One day a great merchant, named Upendra&#347;akti, found an image of
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, carved out of a jewel, on the border of a tank, and
brought it and gave it to that prince. The prince, seeing that it was
of priceless value, out of his fervent piety, set it up in a very
splendid manner in a temple. And he appointed a thousand villages there
for the permanent support of the temple, and he ordained in honour of
the idol a festive procession, at which all M&aacute;lava assembled.
And Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, being pleased with the numerous dances, songs,
and instrumental performances in his honour, said to the Ga&#7751;as at
night, &ldquo;By my favour this &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana shall be a
universal emperor on the earth. Now there is an island named
Hansadv&iacute;pa in the western sea; and in it is a king named
Anangodaya, and he has a lovely daughter named Anangamanjar&iacute;.
And that daughter of his, being devoted to me, always offers to me this
petition after she has worshipped me, &ldquo;Holy one, give me a
husband who shall be the lord of the whole earth.&rdquo; So I will
marry her to this &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, and thus I shall have
bestowed on both the meet reward of their devotion to me. So you must
take &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana there, and after you have contrived
that they should see one another, bring him back quickly; and in course
of time they shall be united in due form; but it cannot be done
immediately, for such is the will of destiny. Moreover I have
determined by these means to recompense Upendra&#347;akti, the
merchant, who brought my image to the prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ga&#7751;as, having received this order from Ga&#7751;e&#347;a,
took &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana that very night, while he was asleep,
and carried him to Hansadv&iacute;pa by their supernatural power. And
there they introduced him into the chamber of Anangamanjar&iacute;, and
placed him on the bed on which that princess was lying asleep.
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana immediately woke up, and saw
Anangamanjar&iacute;. She was reclining on a bed covered with a
coverlet of pure white woven silk, in a splendid chamber in which
flashed jewel-lamps, and which was illuminated by the numerous
priceless gems of the canopy and other furniture, and the floor of
which was dark with the <i lang="sa-latn">r&aacute;j&aacute;varta</i>
stone. As she lay there pouring forth rays of beauty like the lovely
effluence of a stream of nectar, she seemed like the orb of the autumn
moon lapped in a fragment of a white cloud, in a sky adorned with a
host of bright twinkling stars, gladdening the eyes. Immediately he was
delighted, astonished, and bewildered, and he said to himself, &ldquo;I
went to sleep at home and I have woke up in a very different place.
What does all this mean? Who is this woman? Surely it is a dream! Very
well, let it be so. But I will wake up this lady and find out.&rdquo;
After these reflections he gently nudged Anangamanjar&iacute; on the
shoulder with his hand. And the touch of his hand made her immediately
awake and roll her eyes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>as the <i lang=
"sa-latn">kumudvat&iacute;</i> opens under the rays of the moon, and
the bees begin to circle in its cup. When she saw him, she reflected
for a moment, &ldquo;Who can this being of celestial appearance be?
Surely he must be some god that has penetrated into this well-guarded
room?&rdquo; So she rose up, and asked him earnestly and respectfully
who he was, and how and why he had entered there. Then he told his
story, and the fair one, when questioned by him, told him in turn her
country, name, and descent. Then they both fell in love with one
another, and each ceased to believe that the other was an object seen
in a dream, and in order to make certain, they exchanged ornaments.</p>
<p>Then they both became eager for the G&aacute;ndharva form of
marriage, but the Ga&#7751;as stupefied them, and laid them to sleep.
And, as soon as &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana fell asleep, they took him
and carried him back to his own palace, cheated by Destiny of his
desire. Then &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana woke up in his own palace, and
seeing himself decked with the ornaments of a lady, he thought,
&ldquo;What does this mean? At one moment I am in that heavenly palace
with the daughter of the king of Hansadv&iacute;pa, at another moment I
am here. It cannot be a dream, for here are these ornaments of hers on
my wrist, so it must be some strange freak of Destiny.&rdquo; While he
was engaged in these speculations, his wife Padmish&#7789;h&aacute;
woke up, and questioned him, and the kind woman comforted him, and so
he passed the night. And the next morning he told the whole story to
&#346;r&iacute;sena, before whom he appeared wearing the ornaments
marked with the name of Anangamanjar&iacute;. And the king, wishing to
please him, had a proclamation made by beat of drum, to find out where
Hansadv&iacute;pa was, but could not find out from any one the road to
that country. Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e7517" title=
"Source: &#346;ridar&#347;ana">&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana</span>,
separated from Anangamanjar&iacute;, remained overpowered by the fever
of love, averse to all enjoyment. He could not like his food while he
gazed on her ornaments, necklace and all, and he abandoned sleep,
having ceased to behold within reach the lotus of her face.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7520src" href="#xd27e7520" name=
"xd27e7520src">27</a></p>
<p>In the meanwhile the princess Anangamanjar&iacute;, in
Hansadv&iacute;pa, was awakened in the morning by the sound of music.
When she remembered what had taken place in the night, and saw her body
adorned with &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana&rsquo;s ornaments, longing
love made her melancholy. And she reflected, &ldquo;Alas I am brought
into a state, in which my life is in danger, by these ornaments, which
prove that I cannot have been deluded by a dream, and fill me with love
for an unattainable object.&rdquo; While she was engaged in these
reflections, her father Anangodaya suddenly entered, and saw her
wearing the ornaments of a man. The king, who was very fond of her,
when he saw her covering her body with her clothes, and downcast with
shame, took her on his lap and said to her, &ldquo;My daughter, what is
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>meaning of these masculine decorations, and why
this shame? Tell me. Do not shew a want of confidence in me, for my
life hangs on you.&rdquo; These and other kind speeches of her
father&rsquo;s allayed her feeling of shame, and she told him at last
the whole story.</p>
<p>Then her father, thinking that it was a piece of supernatural
enchantment, felt great doubt as to what steps he ought to take. So he
went and asked an ascetic of the name of Brahmasoma, who possessed
superhuman powers, and observed the rule of the P&aacute;&#347;upatas,
and who was a great friend of his, for his advice. The ascetic by his
powers of contemplation penetrated the mystery, and said to the king;
&ldquo;The truth is that the Ga&#7751;as brought here prince
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana from M&aacute;lava, for Ga&#7751;e&#347;a
is favourably disposed both to him and your daughter, and by his favour
he shall become a universal monarch. So he is a capital match for your
daughter.&rdquo; When that gifted seer said this, the king bowed and
said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Holy seer, M&aacute;lava is far away from
this great land of Hansadv&iacute;pa. The road is a difficult one, and
this matter does not admit of delay. So in this matter your ever
propitious self is my only stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ascetic, who was so kind to his admirers, had been thus
entreated by the king, he said, &ldquo;I myself will accomplish
this,&rdquo; and he immediately disappeared. And he reached in a moment
the city of king &#346;r&iacute;sena in M&aacute;lava. There he entered
the very temple built by &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, and after bowing
before Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, he sat down and began to praise him, saying
&ldquo;Hail to thee of auspicious form, whose head is crowned with a
garland of stars, so that thou art like the peak of mount Meru! I adore
thy trunk flung up straight in the joy of the dance, so as to sweep the
clouds, like a column supporting the edifice of the three worlds.
Destroyer of obstacles, I worship thy snake-adorned body, swelling out
into a broad pitcher-like belly, the treasure-house of all
success.&rdquo; While the ascetic was engaged in offering these praises
to Ga&#7751;e&#347;a in the temple, it happened that the son of the
merchant-prince Upendra&#347;akti, who brought his image, entered the
temple as he was roaming about. His name was Mahendra&#347;akti, and he
had been rendered uncontrollable by long and violent madness, so he
rushed forward to seize the ascetic. Then the ascetic struck him with
his hand. The merchant&rsquo;s son, as soon as he was struck by the
charm-bearing hand of that ascetic, was freed from madness and
recovered his reason. And, as he was naked, he felt shame, and left the
temple immediately, and covering himself with his hand, he made for his
home. Immediately his father Upendra&#347;akti, hearing of it from the
people, met him full of joy and led him to his house. There he had him
bathed, and properly clothed and adorned, and then he went with him to
the ascetic Brahmasoma. And he offered him much wealth as the restorer
of his son, but the ascetic, as he possessed godlike power, would not
receive it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile king &#346;r&iacute;sena himself, having heard what
had taken place, reverently approached the ascetic, accompanied by
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana. And the king bowed before him, and praised
him, and said, &ldquo;Owing to your coming, this merchant has received
a benefit, by having his son restored to health, so do me a benefit
also by ensuring the welfare of this son of mine
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana.&rdquo; When the king craved this boon of
the ascetic, he smiled and said, &ldquo;King, why should I do anything
to please this thief, who stole at night the heart and the ornaments of
the princess Anangamanjar&iacute; in Hansadv&iacute;pa, and returned
here with them? Nevertheless I must obey your orders.&rdquo; With these
words the ascetic seized &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana by the fore-arm,
and disappeared with him. He took him to Hansadv&iacute;pa, and
introduced him into the palace of king Anangodaya, with his
daughter&rsquo;s ornaments on him. When &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana
arrived, the king welcomed him gladly, but first he threw himself at
the feet of the ascetic and blessed him. And on an auspicious day he
gave &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana his daughter Anangamanjar&iacute;, as
if she were the earth garlanded with countless jewels. And then by the
power of that ascetic he sent his son-in-law, with his wife, to
M&aacute;lava. And when &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana arrived there, the
king welcomed him gladly, and he lived there in happiness with his two
wives.</p>
<p>In course of time king &#346;r&iacute;sena went to the next world,
and that hero took his kingdom and conquered the whole earth. And when
he had attained universal dominion, he had two sons by his two wives
Padmish&#7789;h&aacute; and Anangamanjar&iacute;. And to one of them
the king gave the name of Padmasena, and to the other of Anangasena,
and he reared them up to manhood.</p>
<p>And in course of time king &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, as he was
sitting inside the palace with his two queens, heard a Br&aacute;hman
lamenting outside. So he had the Br&aacute;hman brought inside, and
asked him why he lamented. Then the Br&aacute;hman shewed great
perturbation and said to him; &ldquo;The fire that had points of
burning flame (<i lang="sa-latn">D&iacute;pta&#347;ikhu</i>) has been
now destroyed by a dark cloud of calamity, discharging a loud laugh
(<i lang="sa-latn">A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa</i>), together with its
line of brightness and line of smoke (<i lang=
"sa-latn">Jyotirlekh&aacute;</i> and <i lang=
"sa-latn">Dh&uacute;malekh&aacute;</i><span class="corr" id="xd27e7549"
title="Source: &rdquo;).">).&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7551src" href="#xd27e7551" name="xd27e7551src">28</a> The moment
the Br&aacute;hman had said this, he disappeared. And while the king
was saying in his astonishment, &ldquo;What did he say, and where has
he gone,&rdquo; the two queens, weeping copiously, suddenly fell
dead.</p>
<p>When the king saw that sudden calamity, terrible as the stroke of a
thunderbolt, he exclaimed in his grief, &ldquo;Alas! Alas! what means
this?&rdquo; and fell on the ground wailing. And when he fell, his
attendants picked him up, and carried him to another place, and
Mukharaka took the bodies of the queens, and performed the ceremony of
burning them. At last the king came to his senses, and after mourning
long for the queens, he completed out of affection their funeral
ceremonies. And after he had spent a day <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>darkened by a storm
of tears, he divided the empire of the earth between his two sons.
Then, having conceived the design of renouncing the world, he left his
city, and turning back his subjects who followed him, he went to the
forest to perform austerities.</p>
<p>There he lived on roots and fruits, and one day, as he was wandering
about at will, he came near a banyan-tree. As soon as he came near it,
two women of celestial appearance suddenly issued from it with roots
and fruits in their hands, and they said to him, &ldquo;King, take
these roots and fruits which we offer.&rdquo; When he heard that, he
said, &ldquo;Tell me now who you are.&rdquo; Then those women of
heavenly appearance said to him, &ldquo;Well come into our house and we
will tell you the truth.&rdquo; When he heard that, he consented, and
entering with them, he saw inside the tree a splendid golden city.
There he rested and ate heavenly fruits, and then those women said to
him, &ldquo;Now, king, hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago there dwelt in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na a
Br&aacute;hman, of the name of Kamalagarbha, and he had two wives, the
name of the one was Pathy&aacute;, and the name of the other
Abal&aacute;. Now in course of time all three, the husband and the
wives, were worn out with old age, and at last they entered the fire
together, being attached to one another. And at that time they put up a
petition to &#346;iva from the fire, &lsquo;May we be connected
together as husband and wives in all our future lives!&rsquo; Then
Kamalagarbha, owing to the power of his severe penances, was born in
the Yaksha race as D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha, the son of the Yaksha
Prad&iacute;pt&aacute;ksha, and the younger brother of
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa. His wives too, Pathy&aacute; and
Abal&aacute;, were born as Yaksha maidens, that is to say, as the two
daughters of the king of the Yakshas named Dh&uacute;maketu, and the
name of the one was Jyotirlekh&aacute;, and the name of the other
Dh&uacute;malekh&aacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in course of time those two sisters grew up, and they
went to the forest to perform asceticism, and they propitiated
&#346;iva with the view of obtaining husbands<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> The god was pleased and he appeared to them
and said to them, &lsquo;That man with whom you entered the fire in a
former birth, and who you asked might be your husband in all subsequent
births, was born again as a Yaksha named D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha, the
brother of A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa, but he has become a mortal
owing to the curse of his master, and has been born as a man named
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, so you too must go to the world of men and
be his wives there, but as soon as the curse terminates, you shall all
become Yakshas, husband and wives together.<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7567" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> When &#346;iva said
this, those two Yaksha maidens were born on the earth as <span class=

Anangamanjar&iacute;.<a id="xd27e7573" name="xd27e7573"></a> They
became the wives of &#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana, and after they had
been his wives for some time, that A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa, as fate
would have it, came there in the form of a Br&aacute;hman, and by the
device of employing an ambiguous speech, he managed to utter their
names and remind them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>of their former existence, and
this made them abandon that body and become Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;s.
<span class="corr" id="xd27e7578" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Know that we are those wives of yours,
and you are that D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha.&rdquo; When
&#346;r&iacute;dar&#347;ana had been thus addressed by them, he
remembered his former birth, and immediately became the Yaksha
D&iacute;pta&#347;ikha, and was again duly united to those two wives of
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know therefore, Vichitrakatha, that I am that Yaksha, and
that these wives of mine are Jyotirlekh&aacute; and
Dh&uacute;malekh&aacute;. So, if creatures of godlike descent, like
myself, have to endure such alternations of joy and sorrow, much more
then must mortals. But do not be despondent, my son, for in a short
time you shall be reunited to your master M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta.
And I remained here to entertain you, for this is my earthly dwelling,
so stay here, I will accomplish your desire. Then I will go to my own
home in Kail&aacute;sa.&rdquo; When the Yaksha had in these words told
me his story, he entertained me for some time. And the kind being,
knowing that you had arrived here at night, brought me and laid me
asleep in the midst of you who were asleep. So I was seen by you, and
you have been found by me. This, king, is the history of my adventures
during my separation from you.<span class="corr" title=

<p>When prince M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had heard at night this tale
from his minister <span class="corr" id="xd27e7589" title=

ministers.</p>
<p>So, after he had spent that night on the turf of the forest, he went
on with those companions of his towards Ujjayin&iacute;, having his
mind fixed on obtaining &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, and he
kept searching for those other companions of his, who were separated by
the curse of the N&aacute;ga, and whom he had not yet found.</p>

<p class="first">Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, as he gradually
travelled along in the Vindhya forest, accompanied by those ministers,
&#346;rutadhi and the four others, reached a wood, which was refreshing
with the shade of its goodly fruit-laden trees, and in which there was
a tank of very pure sweet cold water. He bathed in it with his
ministers and ate many fruits, and lo! he suddenly thought that he
heard conversation in a place shut in with creepers. So he went and
looked into that bower of creepers, and he saw inside it a great
elephant, which was refreshing a blind way-worn man by throwing over
him showers of water from his trunk, by giving him fruits, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>fanning him with his ears. And like a kind man,
the elephant said to him lovingly, over and over again, with articulate
voice, &ldquo;Do you feel at all better?&rdquo; When the prince saw
that, he was astonished, and he said to his companions, &ldquo;Look!
how comes it that a wild elephant conducts itself like a man? So you
may be sure that this is some higher being translated into this form
for some reason. And this man is very like my friend
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti. But he is blind. So let us keep a
sharp lookout.&rdquo; When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had said this to
his friends, he remained there concealed, and listened attentively. In
the meanwhile the blind man recovered a little, and the elephant said
to him, &ldquo;Tell me; who are you, and how did you come here, being
blind?&rdquo; Then the blind man said to that mighty elephant,
&ldquo;There is in this land a king of the name of Amaradatta, lord of
the city of Ayodhy&aacute;, he has a son of excellent qualities, named
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, of auspicious birth, and I am that
prince&rsquo;s servant. For some reason or other his father banished
him from his native land, with us his ten companions. We had set out
for Ujjayin&iacute; to obtain <span class="corr" id="xd27e7604" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>,
when we were separated in the forest by the curse of a N&aacute;ga. And
I was blinded by his curse, and wandering about I have arrived here,
living on the fruits, and roots, and water I could get on the way. And
to me death by falling into a chasm, or in some other way, would be
most desirable, but alas! Providence has not bestowed it on me, but
makes me endure calamity. However I feel convinced that, as my pangs of
hunger have been to-day assuaged by your favour, so my blindness also
will be somewhat alleviated, for you are a divinity.&rdquo; When he
said this, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta felt certain who he was, and with
a mind wavering between joy and grief he said to those ministers,
&ldquo;It is our friend Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti that is reduced
to this melancholy state, but it will not do for us to be in a hurry to
greet him immediately. Perhaps this elephant will cure his blindness.
But if he were to see us, he would flee away; so we must stop here and
look at him.&rdquo; When the prince had said this, he remained
listening with his followers. Then Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti said
to that elephant, &ldquo;Now great-souled one, tell me your history;
who are you? How comes it that, though you are an elephant, and are
subject to the fury of elephants, you speak in this gentle way?&rdquo;
When the great elephant heard this, he sighed, and said to him,
&ldquo;Listen! I will tell you my story from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, in the city of Ekalavy&aacute;, there was a
king named &#346;rutadhara, and he had two sons by two wives. When the
king went to heaven, his younger son, named Satyadhara, expelled the
elder son, named &#346;&iacute;ladhara, from the throne.
&#346;&iacute;ladhara was angry on that account, so he went and
propitiated &#346;iva, and craved the following boon from the god, who
was pleased with his asceticism, &ldquo;May I become a Gandharva, in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>order that I may be able to move through the
air, and so slay with ease that kinsman of mine, Satyadhara!&rdquo;
When the holy god &#346;iva heard this, he said to him, &ldquo;This
boon shall be granted to thee, but that enemy of thine has to-day died
a natural death. And he shall be again born in the city of
R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute;, as Samarabha&#7789;a, the favourite son of
king Ugrabha&#7789;a. But thou shalt be born as
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, his elder brother, by a different mother, and
thou shalt kill him and rule the kingdom. But because thou didst
perform these ascetic penances under the influence of anger, thou shalt
be hurled from thy rank by the curse of a hermit, and become a wild
elephant, that remembers its birth and possesses articulate speech, and
when thou shalt comfort a guest in distress and tell him thy history,
then thou shalt be freed from thy elephant-nature and become a
Gandharva, and at the same time a great benefit will be conferred upon
that guest.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had said this, he disappeared, and
&#346;&iacute;ladhara, seeing that his body was emaciated by long
penance, flung himself into the Ganges.</p>
<p>At this point of my tale it happened that, while that king named
Ugrabha&#7789;a, whom I have before mentioned, was living happily in
the city of R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute; with his wife Manoram&aacute; who
was equal to him in birth, there came to his court from a foreign
country an actor named L&aacute;saka. And he exhibited before the king
that dramatic piece in which Vish&#7751;u, in the form of a woman,
carries off the <i lang="sa-latn">am&#7771;ita</i> from the Daityas.
And in that piece the king saw the actor&rsquo;s daughter
L&aacute;savat&iacute; dancing in the character of
Am&#7771;itik&aacute;. When he saw her beauty, that was like that of
the real <i lang="sa-latn">Am&#7771;it&aacute;</i>, with which
Vish&#7751;u bewildered the D&aacute;navas, he fell in love with her.
And at the end of the dance he gave her father much wealth, and
immediately introduced her into his harem. And then he married that
dancer L&aacute;savat&iacute;, and lived with her, having his eyes
riveted upon her face. One day he said to his chaplain named
Yajuh&#803;sv&aacute;min, &ldquo;I have no son, so perform a sacrifice
in order to procure me a son.&rdquo; The chaplain obeyed, and performed
duly, with the help of learned Br&aacute;hmans, a sacrifice for that
king&rsquo;s benefit. And, as he had been previously gained over by
Manoram&aacute;, he gave her to eat, as being the eldest queen, the
first half of the oblation purified with holy texts.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7622src" href="#xd27e7622" name="xd27e7622src">1</a> And he
gave the rest to the second queen L&aacute;savat&iacute;. Then those
two, &#346;&iacute;ladhara and Satyadhara, whom I have before
mentioned, were conceived in those two queens. And when the time came,
Manoram&aacute;, the consort of that king, brought forth a son with
auspicious marks. And at that moment a distinct utterance was heard
from heaven, &ldquo;This child who is born shall be a famous king under
the name of Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a.&rdquo; On the next day
L&aacute;savat&iacute; also brought forth a son, and the king his
father gave him the name of Samarabha&#7789;a. And the usual sacraments
were performed for them, and the two boys gradually grew up. But the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>eldest <span class="corr" id="xd27e7627" title=
"Source: Bhimabha&#7789;a">Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a</span> surpassed the
youngest in all accomplishments, and rivalry in these increased the
natural ill-feeling between them.</p>
<p>One day, as they were engaged in wrestling, Samarabha&#7789;a, being
jealous, struck Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a with his arm with great force
on the neck. Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e7632" title=
"Source: Bhimabha&#7789;a">Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a</span> was enraged,
and immediately throwing his arms round Samarabha&#7789;a, he lifted
him up and flung him on the ground. The fall gave him a severe shock,
and his servants took him up and carried him to his mother, discharging
blood from all the apertures in his body. When she saw him, and found
out what had taken place, she was alarmed on account of her love for
him, and she placed her face close to his and wept bitterly. At that
moment the king entered, and when he saw this sight, he was much
troubled in mind, and asked L&aacute;savat&iacute; what it meant, and
she gave the following answer: &ldquo;This son of mine has been reduced
to this state by Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a. And he is always ill-treating
him, but I have never told you, king; however now, that I have seen
this, I must say, I cannot<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7635src" href=
"#xd27e7635" name="xd27e7635src">2</a> understand how your majesty can
be safe with such a son as this, but let your majesty decide.&rdquo;
When king Ugrabha&#7789;a was thus appealed to by his favourite wife,
he was angry, and banished Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a from his court. And
he took away from him his allowance, and appointed a hundred
R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts with their retainers to guard that
Samarabha&#7789;a. And he put his treasury at the disposal of the
younger son, but he drove the elder son from his presence, and took
away all that he possessed.</p>
<p>Then his mother Manoram&aacute; sent for him and said, &ldquo;Your
father has thrown you over, because he is in love with a dancer. So go
to the palace of my father in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and when you
arrive there, your grandfather will give you his kingdom, for he has no
son. But, if you remain here, your enemy, this Samarabha&#7789;a, will
kill you, for he is powerful.&rdquo; When Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a heard
this speech of his mother&rsquo;s, he said, &ldquo;I am a Kshatriya,
and I will not sneak away from my native land, like a coward. Be of
good cheer, mother! what wretch is able to injure me?&rdquo; When he
said this, his mother answered him, &ldquo;Then procure a numerous body
of companions to guard you, by means of my wealth.&rdquo; When
<span class="corr" id="xd27e7646" title=
"Source: Bhimabha&#7789;a">Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a</span> heard this
proposal, he said, &ldquo;Mother, this is not becoming; for if I did
this, I should be really opposing my father.<a id="xd27e7649" name=
"xd27e7649"></a> You may be quite at your ease, for your blessing alone
will procure me good fortune.&rdquo; When Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a had
encouraged her with these words, he left her. In the meanwhile all the
citizens came to hear of it, and they thought, &ldquo;Alas! a great
injustice has been done to Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a by the king. Surely
Samarabha&#7789;a does not think he is going to rob him of the kingdom.
Well it is an opportunity for us to do him a service, before he comes
to the throne.&rdquo; Having formed this resolution, the citizens
secretly supplied Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a with such abundance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>of wealth, that he lived in great comfort with
his servants. But the younger brother was ever on the look out to kill
his elder brother, supposing that this was his father&rsquo;s object in
furnishing him with a guard.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a heroic and wealthy young Br&aacute;hman, of the
name of &#346;ankhadatta, who was a friend of both brothers, came and
said to Samarabha&#7789;a, &ldquo;You ought not to carry on hostility
with your elder brother; it is not right, and you cannot do him an
injury; on the contrary the result of a quarrel would be disgraceful to
you.&rdquo; When he said this, Samarabha&#7789;a abused and threatened
him; good advice given to a fool does not calm but rather enrages him.
Then the resolute &#346;ankhadatta went away indignant at this
treatment, and made a strict friendship with Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a,
in order to have the opportunity of conquering Samarabha&#7789;a.</p>
<p>Then a merchant, of the name of Ma&#7751;idatta, came there from a
foreign country, bringing with him an excellent horse; it was as white
as the moon; the sound of its neighing was as musical as that of a
clear conch or other sweet-sounding instrument; it looked like the
waves of the sea of milk surging on high; it was marked with curls on
the neck; and adorned with the crest-jewel, the bracelet, and other
signs, which it seemed as if it had acquired by being born in the race
of the Gandharvas. When <span class="corr" id="xd27e7657" title=
"Source: Bhimabha&#7789;a">Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a</span> heard of that
splendid horse, which was mentioned to him by &#346;ankhadatta, he went
and bought it for a high price from that merchant-prince. At that
moment Samarabha&#7789;a, hearing of it, came and tried to buy the
horse from the merchant for double the price. But he refused to give it
him, as it had already been sold to another; then Samarabha&#7789;a,
out of envy, proceeded to carry it off by force. Then there took place
a fierce combat between those two princes, as the adherents of both
came running up with weapons in their hands. Then the mighty arm of
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a laid low the attendants of Samarabha&#7789;a,
and he himself abandoned the horse, and began to retire through fear of
his brother. But as he was retiring, <span class="corr" id="xd27e7660"
title="Source: &#346;ankadatta">&#346;ankhadatta</span>, full of
overpowering anger, pursued him, and laying hold of his hair behind,
was on the point of killing him, when Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a rushed up
and prevented him, saying, &ldquo;Let be for the present, it would be a
grief to my father.&rdquo; Then &#346;ankhadatta let Samarabha&#7789;a
go, and he fled in fear, discharging blood from his wounds, and
repaired to his father.</p>
<p>Then the brave Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a took possession of the horse,
and immediately a Br&aacute;hman came up to him, and taking him aside,
said to him, &ldquo;Your mother the queen Manoram&aacute;, and the
chaplain Yajuh&#803;sv&aacute;min, and Sumati, the minister of your
father, send you the following advice at this juncture. &ldquo;You
know,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7665src" href="#xd27e7665" name=
"xd27e7665src">3</a> dear boy, how the king is always affected towards
you, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>he is especially angry with you at present, now
that this misfortune has happened. So if you feel disposed to save your
own life, and to preserve glory, and justice inviolate, if you have any
regard for the future, if you consider us well disposed towards you;
leave this place unobserved this very evening, as soon as the sun has
set, and make for the palace of your maternal grandfather, and may good
fortune attend you. This is the message they gave me for you, and they
sent you this casket full of precious jewels and gold; receive it from
my hand.&rdquo; When the wise Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a heard this
message, he accepted it, saying, &ldquo;I consent to act thus,&rdquo;
and he took that casket of gold and valuable jewels. And he gave him an
appropriate message to take back, and then dismissed him, and mounted
that horse, sword in hand. And &#346;ankhadatta took some gold and
jewels, and mounted another horse. And then prince
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a set out with him, and after he had gone a long
distance, he reached at dead of night a great thicket of reeds that lay
in his way. As he and his companion pursued their course through it
without stopping, a couple of lions, roused by the noise, which the
reeds made when trampled by the horses&rsquo; hoofs, rushed out
roaring, with their cubs, and began to rip up the bellies of the horses
with their claws. And immediately the hero and his companion cut off
the limbs of the lions with their swords, and killed them. Then he got
down with his friend to look at the state of the two horses, but as
their entrails were torn out, they immediately fell down dead. When
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a saw that, he felt despondent, and he said to
&#346;ankhadatta, &ldquo;Friend, by a great effort we have escaped from
our hostile relatives. Tell me, where, even by a hundred efforts, shall
we find an escape from Fate, who has now smitten us even here, not
allowing us even to retain our horses. The very horse, for which I
abandoned my native land, is dead; so how can we travel on foot through
this forest at night?&rdquo; When he said this, his friend
&#346;ankhadatta answered him, &ldquo;It is no new thing for hostile
Fate to conquer courage. This is its nature, but it is conquered by
firm endurance. What can Fate do against a firm unshaken man, any more
than the wind against a mountain? So come, let us mount upon the horse
of endurance and so plod on here.&rdquo; When &#346;ankhadatta said
this, Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a set out with him. Then they slowly
crossed that thicket, wounding their feet with the canes, and at last
the night came to an end. And the sun, the lamp of the world, arose,
dispelling the darkness of night, and the lotus-flowers in the
lotus-clumps, by the side of their path, with their expanding cups and
the sweet murmur of their bees, seemed to be looking at one another and
saying, &ldquo;It is a happy thing that this Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a
has crossed this thicket full of lions and other dangerous
animals.&rdquo; So travelling on, he at last reached with his friend
the sandy shore of the Ganges, dotted with the huts of hermits. There
he drank its sweet waters, which seemed to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>impregnated with the nectar of the moon, from
dwelling on the head of &#346;iva, and he bathed in them, and felt
refreshed. And he ate, by way of sustenance, some venison, which they
had bought from a hunter whom they happened to meet, and which
&#346;ankhadatta brought to him roasted. And seeing that the Ganges was
full and difficult to cross, for with its waves uplifted like hands it
seemed again and again to warn him back, he proceeded to roam along the
bank of the river. And there he saw a young Br&aacute;hman in the court
of an out-of-the-way hut, engaged in the study of the Vedas. So he went
up to him and said, &ldquo;Who are you, and what are you doing in this
solitary place?&rdquo; Then the young Br&aacute;hman answered him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am N&iacute;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha, the son of a
Br&aacute;hman named &#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha, who lived at
<span class="corr" id="xd27e7680" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
and after all the ceremonies had been performed for me, and I had
learnt knowledge in the family of my spiritual preceptor, I returned
home and found all my relations dead. That left me helpless and poor,
and as I was not in a position to carry on the duties of a householder,
I became despondent, and repaired to this place, and had recourse to
severe asceticism. Then the goddess Gang&aacute; gave me some fruits in
a dream, and said to me, &lsquo;Remain here living on these fruits,
until you obtain your desire.&rsquo; Then I woke up and went and
bathed, and when the morning came, I found in the water some fruits,
that had been washed here by the stream of the Ganges. I brought those
fruits, delicious as nectar, into my hut, and ate them there, and so I
remain here engaged in asceticism, receiving these fruits day by
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a said to &#346;ankhadatta,
&ldquo;I will give this virtuous youth enough wealth to enable him to
enter the householder-state.&rdquo; &#346;ankhadatta approved his
speech; whereupon the prince gave the Br&aacute;hman the wealth that
his mother gave him. For what is the use of the greatness of great
ones, who have abundant courage and wealth, if they do not put a stop
to the sufferings of their neighbour as soon as they hear of them?</p>
<p>And after he had made the fortune of the Br&aacute;hman,
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a searched in every direction for some means of
crossing the Ganges, but could not find any. Then he tied his ornaments
and sword on his head, and plunged in with &#346;ankhadatta to swim
across it.</p>
<p>And in the middle of the river the current carried his friend to a
distance from him, and he himself was swept away by the waves, and
reached the bank with difficulty. When he reached the other side, he
could not see his friend &#346;ankhadatta, and while he was looking for
him along the bank, the sun set. Then he began to despair, and he
exclaimed in bitter grief, &ldquo;Alas my friend!&rdquo; and it being
now the beginning of the night, he prepared to drown himself in the
waters of the Ganges. He said, &ldquo;Goddess J&aacute;hnav&iacute;,
you have taken from me my life in the form of my friend, so now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>receive also this empty vessel of my
body,&rdquo; and he was on the point of plunging in, when Gang&aacute;
appeared to him from the middle of the flood. And pleased with his
violent agitation she said to him then and there, &ldquo;Do not act
rashly, my son! your friend is alive, and in a short time you shall be
reunited with him. Now receive from me this charm called,
&lsquo;Forwards and Backwards.&rsquo; If a man repeats it forwards, he
will become invisible to his neighbour, but if he repeats it backwards,
he will assume whatever shape he desires.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7692src" href="#xd27e7692" name="xd27e7692src">4</a> Such is the
force of this charm only seven syllables long, and by its help you
shall become a king on this earth.&rdquo; When the goddess Gang&aacute;
had said this, and given him the charm, she disappeared from his eyes,
and he gave up the idea of suicide, now that he had got a hope of
regaining his friend and of other successes. And being anxious to
regain his friend, he passed the night in impatience, like the
lotus-flower, and the next morning he set out in search of him.</p>
<p>Then, as he was travelling about in search of &#346;ankhadatta, he
one day reached alone the district of L&aacute;&#7789;a, where, though
the colours of the castes are not mixed, the people lead a diversified
and richly coloured life, which though a seat of fine arts, is not
reputed a home of crimes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7703src" href=
"#xd27e7703" name="xd27e7703src">5</a> In this city he wandered about,
looking at the temples and the dwelling-houses, and at last he reached
a hall of gamblers. He entered it and saw a number of fraudulent
dice-players, who though they were clothed in a loin-rag only, shewed
by their handsome, well-shaped, stout limbs, which indicated good
living and plenty of exercise, that they were men of rank though they
concealed it, and that they had resorted to that occupation for the
sake of making money. They began to talk to him, so he sat down to play
with them, and they fancied that they would make a fine thing out of
him and his ornaments. Then he beat them at the dice-play, and won from
the rogues all the wealth which they had acquired by cheating
others.</p>
<p>Then those gamblers, having lost their wealth, were preparing to go
home, when Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a set his arms against the door and
stopped them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>and said to them, &ldquo;Where are you going?
Take back this wealth; I do not want it. I must give it away to my
friends, and are not you my friends? Where can I find<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7727src" href="#xd27e7727" name="xd27e7727src">6</a> such dear
friends as you?&rdquo; When he said this, and they declined to take the
money out of shame, a gambler there, of the name of
Akshakshapa&#7751;aka, said, &ldquo;Undoubtedly it is the definition of
gambling that what is won is not returned, but if this gentleman
becomes our friend, and gives us of his own accord wealth which he has
fairly won, why should we not take it?&rdquo; The others, when they
heard this, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is fitting, if he makes such an
eternal friendship with us.&rdquo; When they said this, he came to the
conclusion that they were men of spirit, and he at once consented to
swear eternal friendship to them, and gave them back their wealth. And
at their request he went into a garden with them and their families,
and refreshed himself with food, and wine, and other luxuries, supplied
by them. Then, at the request of Akshakshapa&#7751;aka and the others,
he told his name, race, and history, and asked them also for theirs.
Then Akshakshapa&#7751;aka told him the story of his life.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Akshakshapa&#7751;aka.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in Hastin&aacute;pura a Br&aacute;hman
named &#346;ivadatta, a very rich man, and I am his son, and my real
name is Vasudatta. And in my youth I learnt skill in arms as well as in
the Vedas. Then my father made me marry a wife from a family equal in
rank to my own. But my mother was a great scold, implacable, and very
passionate. And she worried my father so intolerably, that as soon as
he saw me married, he left his home, and went away somewhere where he
could not be traced. When I saw that, I was afraid, and I earnestly
enjoined on my wife to study carefully my mother&rsquo;s disposition,
and she, being terrified, did so. But my mother was bent on
quarrelling, and it was impossible for my wife to please her in any
way. The ill-natured woman interpreted her silence as contempt, her
plaintive lamentation as hypocrisy, and her attempts at explanation as
wrangling. For who can deprive the fire of its tendency to burn? Then
her disagreeable behaviour in a short time worried my wife also so
much, that she left the house and fled I know not where.</p>
<p>Then I was so despondent that I made up my mind to abandon family
life, but my wretched relations assembled together and forced me to
take another wife. That second wife of mine also was so worried by my
mother, that she committed suicide by hanging herself. Then I was
exceedingly vexed, and I determined to go to a foreign country. And
when my relations tried to prevent me, I told them of the wickedness of
my mother. They assigned another reason for my father&rsquo;s leaving
the country, and would not believe my story; so I adopted the following
artifice. I had a wooden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>doll made, and pretended to marry
it privately as a third wife, and I brought it and placed it in another
secluded house which I locked up. And I made another female puppet to
guard her, dressed like a servant. And I said to my mother, &ldquo;I
have put this wife of mine in a separate house. So you and I must for
the present remain apart from her in our own house; you must not go
there and she must not come here. For she is timid as yet, and does not
know how to win your affection.&rdquo; To this arrangement my mother
gave her consent.</p>
<p>After some days had elapsed, my mother, finding that she could not
manage anyhow to get at that supposed daughter-in-law of hers, who was
in a private house kept always locked, took a stone one day and struck
herself on the head, and remained in the courtyard in front of her own
house, streaming with blood, and lamenting with loud cries. Then I and
all my relations came in, hearing the cries, and when we saw her, we
said, &ldquo;Tell us, what is the matter?&rdquo; When we asked her this
question, she said spitefully, &ldquo;My daughter-in-law came without
any reason and reduced me to this state; so now my only remedy is
death.&rdquo; When my relations heard this, they were furious, and they
took her and me with them to the house where I kept the wooden doll.
They removed the fastening, and opened the door, and went in, and lo!
they saw nothing there but a wooden doll. Then they laughed at my
mother, who was covered with shame, having imposed on no one but
herself, and they began to repose confidence in what I had said, and so
they went away again.</p>
<p>And I left that country, and travelled about till I came to this
region, and here I happened to enter a gambling-hall. And there I saw
these five men playing, this man named Cha&#7751;&#7693;abhujanga, and
that P&aacute;&#347;upata, and this
&#346;ma&#347;&aacute;navet&aacute;la, and that
K&aacute;lavar&aacute;&#7789;aka, and this &#346;&aacute;riprastara,
heroes equal in valour. And I gambled with them on this mutual
understanding, that whoever was conquered should be the slave of the
conqueror. Then they became my slaves by being beaten by me in
gambling, but I have become their slave by being won over by their good
qualities. And dwelling with them I have forgotten my woes.</p>
<p>So know that here I bear the name of Akshakshapa&#7751;a,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7748src" href="#xd27e7748" name="xd27e7748src">7</a>
a name suited to my condition. Here I have lived with these excellent
men of good family, who conceal their real position, and now you have
joined us. So now you are our chief, and it was with this view that we
took that money of yours originally, being charmed with your
virtues.</p>
<p>When Akshakshapa&#7751;a had told his story in these words, all the
others in succession also told their adventures. And prince
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a perceived that his friends were heroes, who had
disguised their real character by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>taking up gambling practices
for the sake of gaining wealth, so he had much more pleasant chat with
them, and spent the day in amusement, and then seeing that the eastern
quarter had adorned its face with the rising moon, as with an
ornamental patch, he went from that garden with Akshakshapa&#7751;aka
and the other six to their dwelling. And while he was there with them,
the rainy season arrived, seeming to announce with the roarings of its
joyous clouds his recovery of his friend. And then the impetuous river
there, named Vip&aacute;&#347;&aacute;, that flowed into the sea, was
filled with an influx of sea-water and began to flow backwards, and it
deluged that shore with a great inundation, and then owing to the
cessation of that influx,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7757src" href=
"#xd27e7757" name="xd27e7757src">8</a> it seemed to flow on again to
the sea. Now at that time the sudden influx of sea-water brought in a
great fish, and on account of its unwieldy size it was stranded on the
bank of the river. And the inhabitants, when they saw the fish
stranded, ran forward with all kinds of weapons to kill it, and ripped
open its stomach. And when its stomach was cut open, there came out of
it alive a young Br&aacute;hman; and the people, astonished at that
strange sight, raised a shout.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7763src"
href="#xd27e7763" name="xd27e7763src">9</a> When
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a heard that, he went there with his friends, and
saw his friend &#346;ankhadatta, who had just issued from the inside of
the fish. So he ran and embraced him, and bedewed him with copious
tears, as if he wished to wash off the evil smell he had contracted by
living in the gulf of the fish&rsquo;s maw.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7769src" href="#xd27e7769" name="xd27e7769src">10</a>
&#346;ankhadatta, for his part, having escaped that calamity, and
having found and embraced his friend, went from joy to joy. Then being
questioned out of curiosity by Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, he gave this
brief account of his adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that occasion, when I was swept out of your sight by the
force of the waves of the Ganges, I was suddenly swallowed by a very
large fish. Then I remained for a long time inside the capacious
habitation of his stomach, eating in my hunger his flesh, which I cut
off with a knife. To-day Providence somehow or other brought this fish
here, and threw it up upon the bank, so that it was killed by these men
and I was taken out of its stomach. I have seen again you and the light
of the sun, the horizon has been once more illuminated for me. This, my
friend, is the story of my adventures, I know no more than
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;ankhadatta said this, Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a and all
that were present exclaimed in astonishment, &ldquo;To think that he
should have been swallowed in the Ganges by a fish, and that that fish
should have got into the sea, and then that from the sea it should have
been brought into the Vip&aacute;&#347;&aacute;, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>and
that it should have been killed, and then that &#346;ankhadatta should
have come out of it alive. Ah! the way of fate is inscrutable, and
wonderful are its works!&rdquo; While uttering such remarks with
Akshakshapa&#7751;aka and the others, Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a took
&#346;ankhadatta to his own dwelling. And there in high delight he
entertained with a bath, clothes, and other needful things, his friend,
who had, as it were, been born a second time with the same body from
the belly of a fish.</p>
<p>And while Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a was living with him in that
country, there came on there a festive procession in honour of
V&aacute;suki the king of the snakes. In order to see it, the prince
went, surrounded with his friends, to the temple of that chief of the
snakes, where great crowds were assembling. He worshipped there in the
temple, where his idol was, which was full of long wreaths<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7780src" href="#xd27e7780" name=
"xd27e7780src">11</a> of flowers in form like serpents, and which
therefore resembled the abyss of P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and then going
in a southerly direction, he beheld a great lake sacred to
V&aacute;suki, studded with red lotuses, resembling the concentrated
gleams of the brilliance of the jewels on snakes&rsquo;
crests;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7789src" href="#xd27e7789" name=
"xd27e7789src">12</a> and encircled with blue lotuses, which seemed
like clouds of smoke from the fire of snake-poison; overhung with
trees, that seemed to be worshipping with their flowers blown down by
the wind. When he saw it, he said to himself in astonishment,
&ldquo;Compared with this expanded lake, that sea from which
Vish&#7751;u carried off the goddess of Fortune, seems to me to be only
worthy of neglect, for its fortune of beauty is not to be taken from it
by anything else.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd27e7794src"
href="#xd27e7794" name="xd27e7794src">13</a> In the meanwhile he saw a
maiden, who had come there to bathe, by name Hans&aacute;val&iacute;,
the beautiful daughter of Chandr&aacute;ditya, king of
L&aacute;&#7789;a, by Kuvalayavat&iacute;; her mortal nature, which was
concealed by all her other members moulded like those of gods, was
revealed by the winking of her rolling eye. She had ten million
perfections darting forth from her flower-soft body, she was with her
waist, that might be spanned with the hand, a very bow of Cupid, and
the moment she looked at Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, she pierced him in
the heart with the sidelong arrows of her eyes, and bewildered
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7797src" href="#xd27e7797" name=
"xd27e7797src">14</a> He too, who was a thief of the world&rsquo;s
beauty, entered by the oblique path of her eyes the treasure-chamber of
her heart, and robbed her of her self-control. Then she sent secretly a
trustworthy and discreet maid, and enquired from his friends his name
and residence. And after she had bathed, she was taken back to her
palace by her attendants, frequently turning round her face to fix her
eyes on him. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226"
name="pb226">226</a>]</span>then Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, accompanied
by his friends, went to his dwelling, with faltering steps, for he was
entangled with the net which his beloved had cast over him.</p>
<p>And immediately the princess Hans&aacute;val&iacute; sent that maid
to him as an ambassadress of love, with the message for which he
longed. The maid came up to him and said to him in secret,
&ldquo;Prince, the princess Hans&aacute;val&iacute; solicits you thus,
&lsquo;When you see me, who love you, being carried away by the stream
of love, you should rescue me quickly, you should not remain
indifferent upon the bank<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7804src" href=
"#xd27e7804" name="xd27e7804src">15</a><span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7812" title="Source: ?">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; When
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a heard from the messenger the nectar of his
beloved&rsquo;s message, he was delighted at having his life saved, and
said to her, &ldquo;I am in the current, I am not upon the bank; does
not my beloved know that? But now, that I have obtained some hope to
cling to,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7815src" href="#xd27e7815" name=
"xd27e7815src">16</a> I will gladly do her bidding. I will this night
come and wait upon her in her private apartments, and no one shall see
me, for I will enter concealed by a charm.&rdquo; When he said this to
the maid, she was pleased, and went and told it to
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, and then she remained anxiously expecting an
interview with him.</p>
<p>And he, in the early part of the night, went adorned with heavenly
ornaments, and making himself invisible by repeating forwards the charm
bestowed on him by Gang&aacute;, entered her splendid chamber which she
had previously cleared of attendants. In that chamber, which suggested
thoughts of love, which was perfumed with aloes, and adorned with
nose-gays of flowers of five hues<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7821src"
href="#xd27e7821" name="xd27e7821src">17</a> arranged there, and which
therefore resembled the garden of the god of love, he beheld that
lovely one exhaling heavenly fragrance, like a blossom put forth by the
creeper of the wonderful charm bestowed by Gang&aacute;. And then the
handsome prince recited the charm backwards, and immediately became
visible to that princess. When he beheld her timidly trembling with a
joyful agitation that made her hair stand on end, his ornaments
immediately tinkled like musical instruments, and he seemed to be
dancing with joy to their music. And the maiden hid her face with the
shame of love, and seemed to be asking her heart, that caused all that
display of emotion, what she was to do now. Then
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a said to her, &ldquo;Fair one, why do you allow
your heart to exhibit shame, though its feelings have been already
revealed? It does not deny the state of affairs; besides how is it
possible to conceal this trembling of the limbs and this bursting
boddice?&rdquo; Then Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a with such words, and other
loving persuasions, made the fair one forget her modesty, and married
her by the G&aacute;ndharva form of marriage. And after he had spent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>that night with her, in sporting like a bee
round the lotus of her mouth, he at last tore himself away, and saying,
&ldquo;I will come again at night,&rdquo; returned to his house.</p>
<p>And when the chamberlains belonging to Hans&aacute;val&iacute;
entered her chamber the next morning, they saw that her lover had been
with her. The ends of her curls were disordered, she had marks of moist
teeth and nails, and she seemed as if the god of Love had appeared in
person and afflicted her with the wounds of all his arrows. They
immediately went and reported the matter to the king, and he secretly
appointed spies to watch at night. And Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a spent
the day with his friends in their usual employments, and in the
beginning of the night again repaired to the bower of his beloved. When
the spies saw that he had entered without being seen, by virtue of his
charm, and discovered that he possessed supernatural powers, they went
out, and told the king, and he gave them this order, &ldquo;The being,
who has entered a well-guarded room without being seen, cannot be a
mere man; so bring him here that I may see what this means. And say to
him politely from me, &lsquo;Why did you not openly ask me for my
daughter? Why did you make a secret of it? For it is difficult to
obtain a bridegroom for my daughter as accomplished as
yourself.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the king had sent off the spies
with this message, they went as he commanded, and stood at the door and
delivered this message to Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a. And the resolute
prince, perceiving that the king had discovered him, answered them
boldly from inside; &ldquo;Tell the king from me, that to-morrow I will
enter his hall of audience, and tell him the truth, for now it is the
dead of night.&rdquo; They then went and gave this message to the king
and he remained silent.<a id="xd27e7828" name="xd27e7828"></a> And in
the morning Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a went to rejoin his friends. And
putting on a magnificent costume, he went with those seven heroes to
the hall of king Chandr&aacute;ditya. When the king saw his splendour,
his resolute bearing and handsome appearance, he received him kindly,
and made him sit on a throne equal to his own, and then his friend, the
Br&aacute;hman &#346;ankhadatta, said to the king, &ldquo;King, this is
the son of Ugrabha&#7789;a the king of R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute;,
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a by name; his might is irresistible on account
of the wonderful power of the charm which he possesses. And he has come
here to sue for the hand of your daughter.&rdquo; When the king heard
that, he remembered the occurrence of the night, and seeing that he was
a suitable match for his daughter, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am fortunate
indeed,&rdquo; and accepted the proposal. And after he had made
splendid preparations for the marriage, he bestowed his daughter
Hans&aacute;val&iacute; on Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a with much wealth.
Then Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, having obtained many elephants, horses,
and villages, remained there in great comfort, possessed of
Hans&aacute;val&iacute; and the goddess of Fortune. And in a few days
his father-in-law gave him that kingdom of L&aacute;&#7789;a, and,
being childless and old, retired to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>the forest. Then the
successful Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, having obtained that kingdom, ruled
it admirably with the help of those seven heroes, <span class="corr"
id="xd27e7832" title="Source: Chandradatta">&#346;ankhadatta</span> and
the others.</p>
<p>Then, in the course of some days, he heard from his spies, that his
father king Ugrabha&#7789;a had gone to Pray&aacute;ga and died there;
and that, when he was intent on death, he had anointed his youngest son
Samarabha&#7789;a, the son of the dancing-girl, king of
R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute;. Then he mourned for his father, and
performed his funeral ceremonies, and sent a messenger to that
Samarabha&#7789;a with a letter. And in the letter, he sent the
following message to the pretender who was treating him unjustly,
&ldquo;Foolish son of a dancing-girl, what business have you to sit on
my father&rsquo;s throne, for it belongs to me, though I have this
kingdom of L&aacute;&#7789;a; so you must not ascend it.&rdquo; And the
messenger went, and after announcing himself, delivered the letter to
that Samarabha&#7789;a, when he was in the hall of assembly. And when
Samarabha&#7789;a read this letter of such an import, under his
brother&rsquo;s sign manual, he was angry, and answered, &ldquo;This
baseless presumption is becoming in this ill-conducted man, who was
long ago banished by my father from the country, because he was not fit
to remain in it. Even the jackal apes the lion, when he is comfortably
ensconced in his native cavern, but when he comes within view of the
lion, he is discovered to be only a jackal.&rdquo; Such was the answer
he roared forth, and he wrote to the same effect in a letter, and sent
his return-messenger to carry it to Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a.</p>
<p>So the return-messenger went, and gave, when introduced by the
warder, that letter to the king of L&aacute;&#7789;a. And when
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a had read that letter, he laughed loudly, and
said to the return-messenger of his brother&mdash;&ldquo;Go, messenger,
and tell that dancing-girl&rsquo;s son from me, &lsquo;On that former
occasion when you tried to seize the horse, I saved you from
&#346;ankhadatta, because you were a child and dear to my father, but I
will no longer endure your insolence. I will certainly send you to my
father who is so fond of you. Make ready, and know that in a few days I
shall have arrived.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; With these words he dismissed
the messenger, and then he began his expedition. When that moon of
kings, glorious in his magnificence,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7839src" href="#xd27e7839" name="xd27e7839src">18</a> mounted his
elephant which resembled a hill, the great sea of his army was agitated
and surged up with a roar, and the horizon was filled with innumerable
feudal chiefs and princes arrived for war,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7842src" href="#xd27e7842" name="xd27e7842src">19</a> and setting
out with their forces; and the earth, swiftly trampled by the elephants
and horses trooping along in great numbers, groaned and trembled under
the weight, as if afraid of being cleft open. In this fashion
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a marched and came near
R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute;, eclipsing the light of the sun in the
heavens with the clouds of dust raised by his army. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile king Samarabha&#7789;a heard of it, and became
indignant; and armed himself, and went out with his army to meet him in
battle. And those two armies met, like the eastern and western seas,
and a great battle took place between the heroes on both sides, awful
as the destruction of the world. Then the fire, produced by the loud
clashing of swords, which seemed as if it had been kindled by the
gnashing of the teeth of the angry god of Death, hid the sky; and
javelins flew with their long points resembling eyelashes, and seemed
like the glances of the nymphs of heaven, as they gazed on the
warriors. Then the field of battle appeared like a stage; its canopy
was dust, its music was the shouting of the army, and its dancers
palpitating trunks. And a furious<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7854src"
href="#xd27e7854" name="xd27e7854src">20</a> torrent of blood, sweeping
along heads, and garlanded with trunks, carried off all living
creatures, like the night of destruction at the end of the world.</p>
<p>But the archer Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a soon routed the army of his
enemies, by means of a combined attack of the mighty warriors
&#346;ankhadatta, and Akshakshapa&#7751;aka, and
Cha&#7751;&#7693;abhujanga and his fellows, skilled in wrestling,
resembling impetuous elephants<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> And Samarabha&#7789;a was furious, when his
army was routed, and he dashed forward on his chariot, and began to
churn the sea of battle, as Mount Mandara churned the ocean.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7865src" href="#xd27e7865" name=
"xd27e7865src">21</a> Then Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, who was mounted on
an elephant, attacked him, and cut his bow in two with his arrows, and
also killed all the four horses of his chariot. Then Samarabha&#7789;a,
being prevented from using his chariot, ran and struck with a javelin
on the forehead the splendid elephant of Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, and
the elephant, as soon as it was struck, fell dead on the ground. Then
both of them, being deprived of their means of conveyance, had to fight
on foot. And the two angry kings, armed with sword and shield, engaged
in single combat. But Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, though he might have
made himself invisible by means of his charm, and so have killed him,
out of a regard for fairness, would not kill his enemy in that way. But
being a skilful swordsman, he contended against him in open fight, and
cut off with his sword the head of that son of the dancing-girl.</p>
<p>And when that Samarabha&#7789;a was slain with his soldiers, and the
bands of the Siddhas had applauded from the heavens, and the fight had
come to an end, Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a with his friends entered the
city of <span class="corr" id="xd27e7873" title=
"Source: Ra&#7693;h&aacute;">R&aacute;&#7693;h&aacute;</span>, being
praised by heralds and minstrels. Then, returning from a long absence,
after slaying his enemy, he delighted his mother, who was eager to
behold him, as R&aacute;ma did Kau&#347;aly&aacute;. And the citizens
welcomed him, and then he adorned the throne of his father, and took
his seat on it, honoured by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>father&rsquo;s ministers, who
loved his good qualities. And then he honoured all his subjects, who
made high festival; and on a lucky day he gave to &#346;ankhadatta the
kingdom of L&aacute;&#7789;a. And he sent him to the territory of
L&aacute;&#7789;a, escorted by a force composed of natives of that
country; and he gave villages and wealth to Akshakshapa&#7751;aka and
his fellows, and he remained surrounded by them, ruling his ancestral
realm, with that queen Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, the daughter of the
king of L&aacute;&#7789;a. And, in course of time, he conquered the
earth, and carried off the daughters of kings, and became exclusively
addicted to the enjoyment of their society. And he devolved his duties
on his ministers, and amused himself with the women of his harem, and
never left its precincts, being engrossed with drinking and other
vices.</p>
<p>Then, one day, the hermit Uttanka came of his own accord to visit
him, as if he were the time of accomplishment of the previous decree of
&#346;iva. And when the hermit came to the door, the king, being
blinded with passion, intoxication, and the pride of sovereignty, would
not listen, though the warders announced his arrival. Then the hermit
was angry, and denounced this curse on the king, &ldquo;O man blinded
with intoxication, you shall fall from your throne, and become a wild
elephant.&rdquo; When the king heard that, fear dispelled his
intoxication, and he went out, and prostrating himself at the foot of
the hermit, began to appease him with humble words. Then the anger of
the great sage was calmed, and he said to him, &ldquo;King, you must
become an elephant, that decree cannot be altered; but when you shall
have relieved a minister of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta&rsquo;s, named
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti, afflicted with the curse of a
N&aacute;ga and blinded, who shall become your guest, and shall tell
him your story, you shall be delivered from this curse; and you shall
return to the state of a Gandharva, as &#346;iva foretold to you, and
then that guest of yours shall recover the use of his eyes.&rdquo; When
the hermit Uttanka had said this, he returned as he came, and
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a was hurled from his throne, and became an
elephant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So know, my friend, that I am that very
Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a, become an elephant, and you are
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti; I know that my curse is now at an
end.&rdquo; When Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a had said this, he abandoned
the form of an elephant, and at once became a Gandharva of heavenly
might. And immediately Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti recovered, to
his intense delight, the use of his eyes, and looked upon that
Gandharva there. And in the meanwhile the discreet
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who had heard their conversation from the
bower of creepers, with his other ministers, having discovered that it
was indeed his friend, rushed quickly and impetuously forth, and threw
his arms round the neck of his minister
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti. And Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti
looked at him, and feeling as if his body had been irrigated with a
sudden flood of nectar, immediately embraced the feet of his lord.</p>
<p>Then the Gandharva Bh&iacute;mabha&#7789;a comforted those two, who
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>weeping, both deeply moved at being reunited
after so long a separation. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, bowing,
said to that Gandharva, &ldquo;That I have recovered this friend of
mine, and that he has recovered his eyesight, is all due to your
wondrous might. Honour to you!&rdquo; When the Gandharva heard that, he
said to that prince, &ldquo;You shall soon recover all your other
ministers, and obtain <span class="corr" id="xd27e7886" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>
as a wife, and become king of the whole earth. So you must not lose
heart. Now, auspicious one, I depart, but I will appear to you when you
think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the matchless chief of the <span class="corr" id="xd27e7891"
title="Source: Gandh&aacute;rvas">Gandharvas</span> had said this to
the prince, and so testified his friendship for him, as his curse was
at an end, and he had obtained prosperous felicity, he flew up swiftly
into the sky, making the whole air resound with the tinkling of his
beautiful bracelet and necklace.</p>
<p>And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, having recovered
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti, and so regained his spirits, spent
that day in the wood, accompanied by his ministers.</p>

<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, having passed that night, set out
in the morning from that wood, together with
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti and his other affectionate ministers,
making for Ujjayin&iacute; in order to gain
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, and looking out for the rest of

<p>And as he was going along on his way, he saw his minister
Vikramake&#347;arin being carried through the air by a hideously
deformed man. And while he was eagerly pointing him out to his other
ministers, that minister alighted from the air near him. And quickly
dismounting from the shoulder of that man, he came up and embraced the
feet of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, with his eyes full of tears. And
the delighted M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta embraced him in return, and so
did his ministers, one after another, and then Vikramake&#347;arin
dismissed that man, saying, &ldquo;Come to me, when I think of
you.&rdquo; Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta out of curiosity asked

<p class="first">When I had been separated from you on that occasion by
the curse of the N&aacute;ga, and had wandered about for many days in
search of you, I said to myself, &ldquo;I will make for
Ujjayin&iacute;, for they will go there quickly,&rdquo; <span class=

having formed this intention, I set out for that city. And in course of
time I reached a village near it, named Brahmasthala, and there I sat
down on the bank of a lake at the foot of a tree. There an old
Br&aacute;hman, afflicted with the bite of a serpent, came up to me and
said, &ldquo;Rise up from this place, my son, lest you incur my fate.
For there is a great serpent here, and I am so tortured by the bite
which he has given me, that I am now about to drown myself in this
lake.&rdquo; When he said this, I dissuaded him, out of compassion,
from committing suicide, and I then and there counteracted the effect
of the poison by my knowledge of antidotes.</p>
<p>Then the Br&aacute;hman eagerly, but with due politeness, asked me
the whole story of my life, and when he knew the facts, said to me
kindly, &ldquo;You have to-day saved my life, so receive, hero, this
charm for mastering Vet&aacute;las, which I inherited from my father.
For it is suitable to you who possess all powers, but what, I pray,
could a feeble creature, like me, do with it?&rdquo; When I heard that,
I answered that noble Br&aacute;hman, &ldquo;What use can I make of
Vet&aacute;las, now that I am separated from
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta?&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that,
he laughed, and went on to say to me, &ldquo;Do you not know that you
can obtain from a Vet&aacute;la all that you desire? Did not king
Trivikramasena obtain of old time the sovereignty of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas by the favour of a Vet&aacute;la? Listen now, I will
tell you his story in proof of it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the banks of the God&aacute;var&iacute; there is a
place named Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na. In it there lived of old time a
famous king, named Trivikramasena, the son of Vikramasena, equal to
Indra in might. Every day, when he was in his hall of audience, a
mendicant named Ksh&aacute;nti&#347;&iacute;la came to him, to pay him
his respects, and presented him with a fruit. And every day, the king
as soon as he received the fruit, gave it into the hand of the
superintendent of his treasury who was near him. In this way ten years
passed, but one day, when the mendicant had left the hall of audience,
after giving the fruit to the king, the king gave it to a young pet
monkey, that had escaped from the hands of its keepers, and happened to
enter there. While the monkey was eating that fruit, it burst open, and
there came out of it a splendid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"
href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>priceless jewel. When the
king saw that, he took up the jewel, and asked the treasurer the
following question, &ldquo;Where have you put all those fruits which I
have been in the habit of handing over to you, after they were given to
me by the mendicant?&rdquo; When the superintendent of the treasury
heard that, he was full of fear, and he said to the king, &ldquo;I used
to throw them into the treasury from the window without opening the
door; if your Majesty orders me, I will open it and look for
them.&rdquo; When the treasurer said this, the king gave him leave to
do so, and he went away, and soon returned, and said to the
king<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;I see that
those fruits have all rotted away in the treasury, and I also see that
there is a heap of jewels there resplendent with radiant
gleams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard it, he was pleased, and gave those jewels to the
treasurer, and the next day he said to the mendicant, who came as
before, &ldquo;Mendicant, why do you court me every day with great
expenditure of wealth? I will not take your fruit to-day until you tell
me.&rdquo; When the king said this, the mendicant said to him in
private, &ldquo;I have an incantation to perform which requires the aid
of a brave man, I request, hero, that you will assist me in it.&rdquo;
When the king heard that, he consented and promised him that he would
do so. Then the mendicant was pleased and he went on to say to that
king, &ldquo;Then I shall be waiting for you at night-fall in the
approaching black fortnight, in the great cemetery here, under the
shade of a <i lang="sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree, and you must come to me
there. The king said&mdash;&ldquo;Well! I will do so.&rdquo; And the
mendicant Ksh&aacute;nti&#347;&iacute;la returned delighted to his own
dwelling.</p>
<p>Then the heroic monarch, as soon as he had got into the black
fortnight, remembered the request of the mendicant, which he had
promised to accomplish for him, and as soon as night came, he enveloped
his head in a black cloth, and left the palace unperceived, sword in
hand, and went fearlessly to the cemetery. It was obscured by a dense
and terrible pall of darkness, and its aspect was rendered awful by the
ghastly flames from the burning of the funeral pyres, and it produced
horror by the bones, skeletons, and skulls of men that appeared in it.
In it were present formidable Bh&uacute;tas and Vet&aacute;las,
joyfully engaged in their horrible activity, and it was alive with the
loud yells of jackals,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7938src" href=
"#xd27e7938" name="xd27e7938src">2</a> so that it seemed like a second
mysterious tremendous form of Bhairava. And after he had searched about
in it, he found that mendicant under a <i lang=
"sa-latn">banyan</i>-tree, engaged in making a circle, and he went up
to him and said, &ldquo;Here I am arrived, mendicant; tell me, what can
I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mendicant heard that, and saw the king, he was delighted,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;King, if I have
found favour in your eyes, go alone a long way from here towards the
south, and you will find an <i lang="sa-latn"><span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7949" title=
"Source: a&#347;oka">&#347;in&#347;ap&aacute;</span></i>-tree.<a class=

On it there is a dead man hanging up; go and bring him here; assist me
in this matter, hero.&rdquo; As soon as the brave king, who was
faithful to his promise, heard this, he said, &ldquo;I will do
so,&rdquo; and went towards the south. And after he had gone some way
in that direction, along a path revealed by the light of the flaming
pyres, he reached with difficulty in the darkness that <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree; the tree was scorched with the smoke of
funeral pyres, and smelt of raw flesh, and looked like a Bh&uacute;ta,
and he saw the corpse hanging on its trunk, as it were on the shoulder
of a demon. So he climbed up, and cutting the string which held it,
flung it to the ground. And the moment it was flung down, it cried out,
as if in pain. Then the king, supposing it was alive, came down and
rubbed its body out of compassion; that made the corpse utter a loud
demoniac laugh. Then the king knew that it was possessed by a
Vet&aacute;la, and said without flinching, &ldquo;Why do you laugh?
Come, let us go off.&rdquo; And immediately he missed from the ground
the corpse possessed by the Vet&aacute;la, and perceived that it was
once more suspended on that very tree. Then he climbed up again and
brought it down, for the heart of heroes is a gem more impenetrable
than adamant. Then king <span class="corr" id="xd27e7961" title=
"Source: Trivikranasena">Trivikramasena</span> threw the corpse
possessed by a Vet&aacute;la over his shoulder, and proceeded to go off
with it, in silence. And as he was going along, the Vet&aacute;la in
the corpse that was on his shoulder said to him, &ldquo;King, I will
tell you a story to beguile the way, listen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the prince, who was helped to a wife by the
son of his father&rsquo;s minister.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7967src"
href="#xd27e7967" name="xd27e7967src">4</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city named
V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;, which is the dwelling-place of
&#346;iva, inhabited by holy beings, and thus resembles the plateau of
mount Kail&aacute;sa. The river Ganges, ever full of water, flows near
it, and appears as if it were the necklace ever resting on its neck; in
that city there lived of old time a king named
Prat&aacute;pamuku&#7789;a, who consumed the families of his enemies
with his valour, as the fire consumes the forest. He had a son named
Vajramuku&#7789;a, who dashed the god of love&rsquo;s pride in his
beauty, and his enemies&rsquo; confidence in their valour. And that
prince had a friend, named Buddhi&#347;ar&iacute;ra, whom he valued
more than his life, the sagacious son of a minister.</p>
<p>Once on a time that prince was amusing himself with that friend, and
his excessive devotion to the chase made him travel a long distance. As
he was cutting off the long-maned<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7973src"
href="#xd27e7973" name="xd27e7973src">5</a> heads of lions with his
arrows, as it were the chowries that represented the glory of their
valour, he entered a great forest. It seemed like the chosen home of
love, with singing cuckoos <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>for bards, fanned by trees with
their clusters of blossoms, waving like chowries. In it he and the
minister&rsquo;s son saw a great lake, looking like a second sea, the
birthplace of lotuses<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7990src" href=
"#xd27e7990" name="xd27e7990src">6</a> of various colours; and in that
pool of gods there was seen by him a maiden of heavenly appearance, who
had come there with her attendants to bathe. She seemed to fill the
splendid tank with the flood of her beauty, and with her glances to
create in it a new forest of blue lotuses. With her face, that
surpassed the moon in beauty, she seemed to put to shame the white
lotuses, and she at once captivated with it the heart of that prince.
The youth too, in the same way, took with a glance such complete
possession of her eyes, that she did not regard her own modesty or even
her ornaments. And as he was looking at her with his attendants, and
wondering who she was, she made, under pretence of pastime, a sign to
tell him her country and other particulars about her. She took a lotus
from her garland of flowers, and put it in her ear, and she remained
for a long time twisting it into the form of an ornament called
<i lang="sa-latn">dantapatra</i> or tooth-leaf, and then she took
another lotus and placed it on her head, and she laid her hand
significantly upon her heart. The prince did not at that time
understand those signs, but his sagacious friend the minister&rsquo;s
son did understand them. The maiden soon departed, being led away from
that place by her attendants, and when she had reached her own house,
she flung herself down on a sofa, but her heart remained with that
prince, to justify the sign she had made.</p>
<p>The prince, for his part, when without her, was like a
Vidy&aacute;dhara who has lost his magic knowledge, and, returning to
his own city, he fell into a miserable condition. And one day the
minister&rsquo;s son questioned him in private, speaking of that beauty
as easy to obtain, whereupon he lost his self-command and exclaimed,
&ldquo;How is she to be obtained, when neither her name, nor her
village, nor her origin is known? So why do you offer me false
comfort?&rdquo; When the prince said this to the minister&rsquo;s son,
he answered, &ldquo;What! did you not see, what she told you by her
signs? By placing the lotus in her ear, she meant to say this, &lsquo;I
live in the realm of king Karnotpala.&rsquo; By making it into the
tooth-leaf ornament she meant to say, &lsquo;Know that I am the
daughter of a dentist<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7998src" href=
"#xd27e7998" name="xd27e7998src">7</a> there.&rsquo; By lifting up the
lotus she let you know her name was Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;; and by
placing her hand on her heart she told you that it was yours. Now there
is a king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>named Karnotpala in the country of Kalinga; he
has a favourite courtier, a great dentist named
Sangr&aacute;mavardhana, and he has a daughter named
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the pearl of the three worlds, whom he values
more than his life. All this I knew from the talk of the people, and so
I understood her signs, which were meant to tell her country and the
other particulars about her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8012src" href=
"#xd27e8012" name="xd27e8012src">8</a></p>
<p>When that prince had been told all this by the minister&rsquo;s son,
he was pleased with that intelligent man, and rejoiced, as he had now
got an opportunity of attaining his object, and, after he had
deliberated with him, he set out with him from his palace on the
pretence of hunting, but really in search of his beloved, and went
again in that direction. And on the way he managed to give his retinue
the slip by the speed of his swift horse, and he went to the country of
Kalinga accompanied by the minister&rsquo;s son only. There they
reached the city of king Karnotpala, and searched for and found the
palace of that dentist, and the prince and the minister&rsquo;s son
entered the house of an old woman, who lived near there, to lodge. The
minister&rsquo;s son gave their horses water and fodder, and placed
them there in concealment, and then said to that old woman in the
presence of the prince, &ldquo;Do you know, mother, a dentist named
Sangr&aacute;mavardhana?&rdquo; When the old woman heard that, she said
to him courteously, &ldquo;I know him well; I was his nurse, and he has
now made me attend upon his daughter as a duenna; but I never go there
at present, as I have been deprived of my clothes, for my wicked son,
who is a gambler, takes away my clothes as soon as he sees them.&rdquo;
When the minister&rsquo;s son heard this, he was delighted, and he
gratified the old woman with the gift of his upper garment and other
presents, and went on to say to her, &ldquo;You are a mother to us, so
do what we request you to do in secret; go to that
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the daughter of the dentist, and say to her,
&lsquo;The prince, whom you saw at the lake, has come here, and out of
love he has sent me to tell you.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the old
woman heard this, she consented, being won over by the presents, and
went to Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and came back in a moment. And when
the prince and the minister&rsquo;s son questioned her, she said to
them, &ldquo;I went and told her secretly that you had come. When she
heard that, she scolded me, and struck me on both cheeks with her two
hands smeared with camphor. So I have come back weeping, distressed at
the insult. See here, my children, these marks of her fingers on my
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, the prince was despondent, as he despaired of
attaining his object, but the sagacious minister&rsquo;s son said to
him in private, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237"
name="pb237">237</a>]</span>&ldquo;Do not despond, for by keeping her
own counsel and scolding the old woman, and striking her on the face
with her ten fingers white with camphor, she meant to say, &lsquo;Wait
for these remaining ten moonlight nights of the white fortnight, for
they are unfavourable to an interview.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the minister&rsquo;s son had comforted the prince with these
words, he went and sold secretly in the market some gold, which he had
about him, and made that old woman prepare a splendid meal, and then
those two ate it with that old woman. After the minister&rsquo;s son
had spent ten days in this fashion, he again sent the old woman to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, to see how matters stood. And she, being fond
of delicious food, liquor, and other enjoyments of the kind, went again
to the dwelling-house of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, to please her guests,
and returned and said to them, &ldquo;I went there to-day and remained
silent, but she of her own accord taunted me with that crime of having
brought your message, and again struck me here on the breast with three
fingers dipped in red dye, so I have returned here thus marked by
her.&rdquo; When the minister&rsquo;s son heard this, he said, of his
own accord, to the prince, &ldquo;Do not entertain any despondent
notions, for by placing the impression of her three fingers marked with
red dye on this woman&rsquo;s heart, she meant to say; &lsquo;I cannot
receive you for three nights.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the minister&rsquo;s son had said this to the prince, he waited
till three days had passed, and again sent the old woman to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. She went to her palace, and
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; honoured her and gave her food, and lovingly
entertained her that day with wine and other enjoyments. And in the
evening, when the old woman wished to go back to her house, there arose
outside a terrible tumult. Then the people were heard exclaiming,
&ldquo;Alas! Alas! a mad elephant has escaped from the post to which he
was tied, and is rushing about, trampling men to death.&rdquo; Then
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; said to that old woman, &ldquo;You must not go
by the public road, which is rendered unsafe by the elephant, so we
will put you on a seat, with a rope fastened to it to support it, and
let you down by this broad window here into the garden of the house,
there you must get up a tree and cross this wall, and then let yourself
down by another tree and go to your own house.&rdquo; After she had
said this, she had the old woman let down from the window by her maid
into the garden, by means of that seat with a rope fastened to it. She
went by the way pointed out to her, and related the whole story,
exactly as it happened, to the prince and the minister&rsquo;s son.
Then the minister&rsquo;s son said to the prince, &ldquo;Your desire is
accomplished, for she has shewn you by an artifice the way you should
take; so go there this very day, as soon as evening sets in, and by
this way enter the palace of your beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the minister&rsquo;s son said this, the prince went with him
into the garden, by the way over the wall pointed out by the old woman.
There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>he saw that rope hanging down with the seat, and
at the top of it were some maids, who seemed to be looking out for his
arrival. So he got on to the seat, and the moment those female servants
saw him, they pulled him up with the rope, and he entered the presence
of his beloved through the window. When he had entered, the
minister&rsquo;s son returned to his lodging. And when the prince
entered, he beheld that Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; with a face like a full
moon, shedding forth beauty like beams, like the night of the full moon
remaining concealed through fear of the black fortnight. As soon as she
saw him, she rose up boldly, and welcomed him with affectionate
embraces and other endearments natural in one who had waited for him so
long. Then the prince married that fair one by the G&aacute;ndharva
form of marriage, and all his wishes being now fulfilled, remained with
her in concealment.</p>
<p>And after he had lived with her some days, he said to her one night,
&ldquo;My friend the minister&rsquo;s son came with me and is staying
here, and he is now left alone in the house of your duenna; I must go
and pay him a visit, fair one, and then I will return to you.&rdquo;
When the cunning Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard that, she said to her
lover, &ldquo;Come now, my husband, I have a question to ask you; did
you guess the meaning of those signs which I made, or was it that
friend of yours the minister&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; When she said this,
the prince said to her, &ldquo;I did not guess anything at all, but
that friend of mine, the minister&rsquo;s son, who is distinguished for
superhuman insight, guessed it all, and told it to me.&rdquo; When the
fair one heard this, she reflected, and said to him, &ldquo;Then you
have acted wrongly in not telling me about him before. Since he is your
friend, he is my brother, and I must always honour him before all
others with gifts of betel and other luxuries.&rdquo; When she had
dismissed him with these words, the prince left the palace at night by
the way by which he came, and returned to his friend. And in the course
of conversation he told him, that he had told his beloved how he
guessed the meaning of the signs which she made. But the
minister&rsquo;s son did not approve of this proceeding on his part,
considering it imprudent. And so the day dawned on them conversing.</p>
<p>Then, as they were again talking together after the termination of
the morning prayer, the confidante of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; came in
with betel and cooked food in her hand. She asked after the health of
the minister&rsquo;s son, and after giving him the dainties, in order
by an artifice to prevent the prince from eating any of them, she said,
in the course of conversation, that her mistress was awaiting his
arrival to feast and spend the day with her, and immediately she
departed unobserved. Then the minister&rsquo;s son said to the prince;
&ldquo;Now observe, prince, I will shew you something wonderful.&rdquo;
Thereupon he gave that cooked food to a dog to eat, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>the
dog, as soon as he had eaten it, fell dead upon the spot. When the
prince saw that, he said to the minister&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;What is
the meaning of this marvel?&rdquo; And he answered him, &ldquo;The
truth is that the lady has found out that I am intelligent, by the fact
that I guessed the meaning of her signs, and so she has sent me this
poisoned food in order to kill me, for she is deeply in love with you,
and thinks that you, prince, will never be exclusively devoted to her
while I am alive, but being under my influence, will perhaps leave her,
and go to your own city. So give up the idea of being angry with her,
persuade the high-spirited woman to leave her relations, and I will
invent and tell you an artifice for carrying her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the minister&rsquo;s son had said this, the prince said to him,
&ldquo;You are rightly named Buddhi&#347;ar&iacute;ra as being an
incarnation of wisdom;&rdquo; and at the very moment that he was thus
praising him, there was suddenly heard outside a general cry from the
sorrowing multitude, &ldquo;Alas! Alas! the king&rsquo;s infant son is
dead.&rdquo; The minister&rsquo;s son was much delighted at hearing
this, and he said to the prince, &ldquo;Repair now to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s palace at night, and there make her
drink so much, that she shall be senseless and motionless with
intoxication, and apparently dead. And when she is asleep, make a mark
on her hip with a red hot iron spike, and take away all her ornaments,
and return by letting yourself down from the window by a rope; and
after that I will take steps to make everything turn out
prosperously.&rdquo; When the minister&rsquo;s son had said this, he
had a three-pronged spike made, with points like the bristles of a
boar, and gave it to the prince. And the prince took in his hand that
weapon which resembled the crooked hard hearts of his beloved and of
his friend, which were firm as black iron; and saying, &ldquo;I will do
as you direct,&rdquo; went at night to the palace of
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; as before, for princes should never hesitate
about following the advice of an excellent minister. There he made his
beloved helpless with drink, and marked her on the hip with the spike,
and took away her ornaments, and then he returned to that friend of
his. And he shewed him the ornaments, and told him what he had done.
Then the minister&rsquo;s son considered his design as good as
accomplished.</p>
<p>And the next morning the minister&rsquo;s son went to the cemetery,
and promptly disguised himself as an ascetic, and he made the prince
assume the guise of a disciple. And he said to him, &ldquo;Go and take
the pearl necklace which is part of this set of ornaments, and pretend
to try to sell it in the market, but put a high price on it, that no
one may be willing to buy it, and that every one may see it being
carried about, and if the police here should arrest you, say
intrepidly, <span class="corr" id="xd27e8040" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>My spiritual preceptor gave it me to
sell.<span class="corr" id="xd27e8043" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the minister&rsquo;s son had sent off the prince on this
errand, he went and wandered about in the market-place, publicly
showing the necklace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>And while he was thus engaged, he
was seen and arrested by the police, who were on the lookout for
thieves, as information had been given about the robbery of the
dentist&rsquo;s daughter. And they immediately took him to the chief
magistrate of the town; and he, seeing that he was dressed as an
ascetic, said to him courteously, &ldquo;Reverend sir, where did you
get this necklace of pearls which was lost in this city, for the
ornaments of the dentist&rsquo;s daughter were stolen during the
night?&rdquo; When the prince, who was disguised as an ascetic, heard
this, he said, &ldquo;My spiritual preceptor gave it me; come and
question him.&rdquo; Then the magistrate of the city came to the
minister&rsquo;s son, and bowed, and said to him, &ldquo;Reverend sir,
where did you get this pearl necklace that is in the possession of your
pupil?&rdquo; When the cunning fellow heard that, he took him aside and
said, &ldquo;I am an ascetic, in the habit of wandering perpetually
backwards and forwards in the forests. As chance would have it, I
arrived here, and as I was in the cemetery at night, I saw a band of
witches collected from different quarters. And one of them brought the
prince, with the lotus of his heart laid bare, and offered him to
Bhairava. And the witch, who possessed great powers of delusion, being
drunk, tried to take away my rosary, while I was reciting my prayers,
making horrible contortions with her face. And as she carried the
attempt too far, I got angry, and heating with a charm the prongs of my
trident, I marked her on the loins. And then I took this necklace from
her neck. And now I must sell this necklace, as it does not suit an
ascetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the magistrate heard this, he went and informed the king. When
the king heard it, he concluded that that was the pearl necklace which
had been lost, and he sent a trustworthy old woman to see if the
dentist&rsquo;s daughter was really marked with a trident on the loins.
The old woman came back and said that the mark could be clearly seen.
Then the king made up his mind that she was a witch, and had really
destroyed his child. So he went in person to that minister&rsquo;s son,
who was personating an ascetic, and asked him how he ought to punish
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;; and by his advice he ordered her to be
banished from the city, though her parents lamented over her. And when
she was banished, and was left in the forest, though naked, she did not
abandon the body, supposing that it was all an artifice devised by the
minister&rsquo;s son. And in the evening the minister&rsquo;s son and
the prince, who had abandoned the dress of ascetics, and were mounted
on their horses, came upon her lamenting. And they consoled her, and
mounted her upon a horse, and took her to their own kingdom. There the
prince lived happily with her. But the dentist, supposing that his
daughter had been devoured by wild beasts in the forest, died of grief,
and his wife followed him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had said this, he went on to say to the king,
&ldquo;Now I have a doubt about this story, resolve it for me; Was the
minister&rsquo;s son guilty of the death of this married couple, or the
prince, or Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;? Tell me, for you are the chief of
sages. And if, king, you do not tell me the truth, though you know it,
this head of yours shall certainly split in a hundred
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la said this, the king, who discerned the truth,
out of fear of being cursed, gave him this answer&mdash;&ldquo;O thou
skilled in magic arts, what difficulty is there about it? Why, none of
the three was in fault, but the whole of the guilt attaches to king
Karnotpala.&rdquo; The Vet&aacute;la then said, &ldquo;Why, what did
the king do? Those three were instrumental in the matter. Are the crows
in fault when the swans eat the rice?&rdquo; Then the king said,
&ldquo;Indeed no one of the three was in fault, for the
minister&rsquo;s son committed no crime, as he was forwarding his
master&rsquo;s interests, and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; and the prince,
being burnt with the fire of the arrows of the god of Love, and being
therefore undiscerning and ignorant, were not to blame, as they were
intent on their own object. But the king Karnotpala, as being untaught
in treatises of policy, and not investigating by means of spies the
true state of affairs even among his own subjects, and not
comprehending the tricks of rogues, and inexperienced in interpreting
gestures and other external indications, is to be considered guilty, on
account of the indiscreet step which he took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, who was in the corpse, heard this, as the
king by giving this correct answer had broken his silence, he
immediately left his shoulder, and went somewhere unobserved by the
force of his magic power, in order to test his persistence; and the
intrepid king at once determined to recover him.</p>

<p class="first">An account of the various forms of the introduction to
the XXV Tales of a Demon will be found in Oesterley&rsquo;s German
translation of the Bait&aacute;l Pach&iacute;s&iacute;. The Hindi
version contains the well-known story of Theodosius the younger and his
wife Athenais or Eudokia. The Mongolian form differs widely from that
in our text. Seven brothers, sorcerers, live in India; a mile from them
live two Khan&rsquo;s sons; the elder of these studies magic under the
seven enchanters for seven years, but learns nothing; the younger
acquires their art in a moment, and both return to their palace. The
younger turns himself into a horse, which the elder by his order sells
to the seven enchanters. These try to kill the horse, but the
Khan&rsquo;s son then turns himself into a fish, which the enchanters
pursue in the form of seven sea-gulls, then into a dove, which they
pursue as seven hawks, then he takes refuge with
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, becoming the chief bead in his rosary, and
asks him to put this bead in his mouth and to strew the rest on the
ground. The beads then become worms which the sorcerers pick up in the
form of hens. The Khan&rsquo;s son changes himself into a man, and
kills the hens with a stick, when lo! seven human corpses are seen
lying on the ground. As a penance for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>this crime the
Khan&rsquo;s son is sent to fetch the Siddhi-k&uuml;r, which he fastens
up in a bag, and which behaves in much the same way as the
Vet&aacute;la does in our text.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there are no questions addressed by the
Siddhi-k&uuml;r to his captor. At the end of every story the
Khan&rsquo;s son utters an involuntary, often meaningless exclamation,
of which the Siddhi-k&uuml;r takes advantage. (Oesterley&rsquo;s
Bait&aacute;l Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pp. 174 and 175.)</p>
<p>Oesterley refers to an Arabian form of the 1st story in
Scott&rsquo;s Tales, Anecdotes and Letters, 1800, p. 108. A painter
falls in love with the picture of a beauty, and finds that the original
is in the possession of a certain minister. He penetrates in disguise
into the minister&rsquo;s harem, wounds his beloved in the hand and
takes away her veil. He then goes in the disguise of a pilgrim to the
king, and says that he has seen six witches, and that he has wounded
one of them, who left her veil behind her. The veil is recognized, the
owner produced, convicted by her veil, and as a witch flung into a
chasm. There the painter finds her, rescues her and carries her off.

Bait&aacute;l Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pp. 182 and 183).</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the three young Br&aacute;hmans who restored
a dead lady to life.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is, on the banks of the river Yamun&aacute;, a
district assigned to Br&aacute;hmans, named Brahmasthala. In it there
lived a Br&aacute;hman, named Agnisv&aacute;min, who had completely
mastered the Vedas. To him there was born a very beautiful daughter
named Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;. Indeed, when Providence had created
this maiden of novel and priceless beauty, he was disgusted with the
nymphs of Heaven<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> his
own previous handiwork. And when she grew up, there came there from
K&aacute;nyakubja three young Br&aacute;hmans, equally matched in all
accomplishments. And each one of these demanded the maiden from her
father for himself, and would sooner sacrifice his life than allow her
to be given to another. But her father would not give her to any one of
them, being afraid that, if he did so, he would cause the death of the
others; so the damsel remained unmarried. And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>those three remained there day and night, with
their eyes exclusively fixed on the moon of her countenance, as if they
had taken upon themselves a vow to imitate the partridge.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8093src" href="#xd27e8093" name=
"xd27e8093src">1</a></p>
<p>Then the maiden Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; suddenly contracted a
burning fever, which ended in her death. Then the young
Br&aacute;hmans, distracted with grief, carried her when dead, after
she had been duly adorned, to the cemetery, and burnt her. And one of
them built a hut there and made her ashes his bed, and remained there
living on the alms he could get by begging. And the second took her
bones and went with them to the Ganges, and the third became an ascetic
and went travelling through foreign lands.</p>
<p>As the ascetic was roaming about, he reached a village named
Vajraloka. And there he entered as a guest the house of a certain
Br&aacute;hman. And the Br&aacute;hman received him courteously. So he
sat down to eat; and in the meanwhile a child there began to cry. When,
in spite of all efforts to quiet it, it would not stop, the mistress of
the house fell into a passion, and taking it up in her arms, threw it
into the blazing fire. The moment the child was thrown in, as its body
was soft, it was reduced to ashes. When the ascetic, who was a guest,
saw this, his hair stood on end, and he exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas! Alas! I
have entered the house of a Br&aacute;hman-demon. So I will not eat
food here now, for such food would be sin in a visible material
shape.&rdquo; When he said this, the householder said to him,
&ldquo;See the power of raising the dead to life inherent in a charm of
mine, which is effectual as soon as recited.&rdquo; When he had said
this, he took the book containing the charm and read it, and threw on
to the ashes some dust, over which the charm had been recited.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8100src" href="#xd27e8100" name="xd27e8100src">2</a>
That made the boy rise up alive, exactly as he was before. Then the
mind of the Br&aacute;hman ascetic was quieted, and he was able to take
his meal there. And the master of the house put the book up on a
bracket, and after taking food, went to bed at night, and so did the
ascetic. But when the master of the house was asleep, the ascetic got
up timidly, and took the book, with the desire of restoring his beloved
to life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he left the house with the book, and travelling day and night at
last reached the cemetery, where that beloved of his had been burnt.
And at that moment he saw the second Br&aacute;hman arrive there, who
had gone to throw her bones into the river Ganges. And having also
found the one who remained in the cemetery sleeping on her ashes,
having built a hut over them, he said to the two, &ldquo;Remove this
hut, in order that by the power of a certain charm I may raise up my
beloved alive from her ashes.&rdquo; Having earnestly solicited them to
do this, and having overturned that hut, the Br&aacute;hman ascetic
opened the book, and read the charm. And after thus charming some dust,
he threw it on the ashes, and that made Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; rise
up alive. And as she had entered the fire, she possessed, when
resuscitated, a body that had come out of it more splendid than before,
as if made of gold.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8121src" href=
"#xd27e8121" name="xd27e8121src">3</a></p>
<p>When the three Br&aacute;hmans saw her resuscitated in this form,
they immediately became love-sick, and quarrelled with one another,
each desiring her for himself. And the first said, &ldquo;She is my
wife, for she was won by the power of my charm.&rdquo; And the second
said, &ldquo;She belongs to me, for she was produced by the efficacy of
sacred bathing-places.&rdquo; And the third said, &ldquo;She is mine,
for I preserved her ashes, and resuscitated her by
asceticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now king, give judgment to decide their dispute; whose wife
ought the maiden to be? If you know and do not say, your head shall fly
in pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this from the Vet&aacute;la, he said to him,
&ldquo;The one who restored her to life by a charm, though he endured
hardship, must be considered her father, because he performed that
office for her, and not her husband; and he who carried her bones to
the Ganges is considered her son; but he, who out of love lay on her
ashes, and so remained in the cemetery embracing her and practising
asceticism, he is to be called her husband, for he acted like one in
his deep affection.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8135src" href=
"#xd27e8135" name="xd27e8135src">4</a></p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard this from king Trivikramasena, who had
broken silence by uttering it, he left his shoulder, and went back
invisible to his own place. But the king, who was bent on forwarding
the object of the mendicant, made up his mind to fetch him again, for
men of firm resolution do not desist from accomplishing a task they
have promised to perform, even though they lose their lives in the
attempt.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on the earth a famous city named
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. In it there lived of old time a king named
Vikramake&#347;arin, whom Providence made a storehouse of virtues as
well as of jewels. And he possessed a parrot of godlike intellect,
knowing all the <i lang="sa-latn">&#347;&aacute;stras</i>, that had
been born in that condition owing to a curse, and its name was
Vidagdhach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i. And the prince married as
a wife, by the advice of the parrot, a princess of equal birth, of the
royal family of Magadha, named Chandraprabh&aacute;. That princess also
possessed a similar hen-<i lang="sa-latn">maina</i>, of the name of
Somik&aacute;, remarkable for knowledge and discernment. And the two,
the parrot and the <i lang="sa-latn">maina</i>, remained there in the
same cage, assisting with their discernment their master and
mistress.</p>
<p>One day the parrot became enamoured of the <i lang=

sleep, perch, and feed in the same cage.&rdquo; But the <i lang=

with a male, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"

The parrot retorted, &ldquo;It is not true that males are wicked, but
females are wicked and cruel-hearted.&rdquo; And so a dispute arose
between them. The two birds then made a bargain that, if the parrot
won, he should have the <i lang="sa-latn">maina</i> for wife, and if
the <i lang="sa-latn">maina</i> won, the parrot should be her slave,
and they came before the prince to get a true judgment. The prince, who
was in his father&rsquo;s judgment-hall, heard the point at issue
between them, and then said to the <i lang="sa-latn">maina</i>,
&ldquo;Tell me, how are males ungrateful?&rdquo; Then the <i lang=
"sa-latn">maina</i> said, &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; and in order to
establish her contention, proceeded to relate this story illustrating
the faults of males.</p>

<p class="first">There is on the earth a famous city, of the name of
K&aacute;mandak&iacute;. In it there was a rich merchant, of the name
of Arthadatta. And he had a son born to him, of the name of Dhanadatta.
When his father died, the young man became dissipated. And rogues got
round him, and plunged him in the love of gambling and other vices. In
truth the society of the wicked is the root of the tree of vice. In a
short time his wealth was exhausted by dissipation, and being ashamed
of his poverty, he left his own country, to wander about in foreign
lands.</p>
<p>And in the course of his travels, he reached a place named
Cha&#7751;&#7693;anapura, and desiring food, he entered the house of a
certain merchant. As fate would have it, the merchant, seeing that he
was a handsome youth, asked him his descent and other things, and
finding out that he was of good birth, entertained him, and adopted him
as a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>. And he gave him his daughter
Ratn&aacute;val&iacute;, with a dower, and thenceforth Dhanadatta lived
in his father-in-law&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And in the course of some days, he forgot in his present happiness
his former misery, and having acquired wealth, and longing for fresh
dissipation, he wished to go back to his own land. Then the rascal with
difficulty wrung a permission from his unwilling father-in-law, whose
daughter was his only child, and taking with him his wife, covered with
ornaments, accompanied by an old woman, set out from that place, with a
party of three in all. And in course of time he reached a distant wood,
and on the plea that there was danger of robbers, he took those
ornaments from his wife and got them into his own possession. Alas!
Observe that the heart of ungrateful males, addicted to the hateful
vices of dicing and drabbing, is as hard as a sword.</p>
<p>Then the villain, being determined to kill his wife, though she was
virtuous, for the sake of her wealth, threw her and the old woman into
a ravine. And after he had thrown them there, he went away. The old
woman was killed, but his wife was caught in a mass of creepers and did

chasm, weeping bitterly, supporting herself by clinging to grass and
creepers, for the appointed end of her life had not yet come. And
asking her way, step by step, she arrived, by the road by which she
came, at the house of her father, with difficulty, for her limbs were
sorely bruised. When she arrived there suddenly, in this state, her
mother and father questioned her eagerly. And the virtuous lady weeping
told this tale, &ldquo;We were robbed on the way by bandits, and my
husband was dragged away bound; the old woman died, but I survived,
though I fell into a ravine. Then I was dragged out of the ravine by a
certain benevolent traveller, who came that way, and by the favour of
destiny I have arrived here.&rdquo; When the good
Ratn&aacute;val&iacute; said this, her father and mother comforted her,
and she remained there, thinking only of her husband.</p>
<p>And in course of time her husband Dhanadatta, who had gone back to
his own country, and wasted that wealth in gambling, said to himself,
&ldquo;I will go and fetch more wealth, begging it from my
father-in-law, and I will tell him that I have left his daughter in my
house here.&rdquo; Thinking thus in his heart, he set out for that
house of his father-in-law, and when he drew near, his wife beheld him
from a distance, and she ran and fell at his feet, though he was a
villain. For, though a husband is wicked, a good wife does not alter
her feelings towards him. And when he was frightened, she told him all
the fictitious story she had previously told her parents about the
robbery, her fall, and so on. Then he entered fearlessly with her the
house of his father-in-law; and his father-in-law and mother-in-law,
when they saw him, welcomed him joyfully. And his father-in-law called
his friends together, and made a great feast on the occasion,
exclaiming, &ldquo;It is indeed a happy thing, that my son-in-law has
been let go with life by the robbers.&rdquo; Then Dhanadatta lived
happily with that wife of his Ratn&aacute;val&iacute;, enjoying the
wealth of his father-in-law. But, fie! what the cruel man did one
night, though it should not be told for shame, must still for the
story&rsquo;s sake be related. He killed his wife when asleep in his
bosom, and took away all her ornaments, and then went away unobserved
to his own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So wicked are males!&rdquo; When the <i lang=
"sa-latn">maina</i> had said this, the king said to the
parrot&mdash;&ldquo;Now say your say.&rdquo;&mdash;Then the parrot
said&mdash;&ldquo;King, females are of intolerable audacity, immoral
and wicked; hear a tale in proof of it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city of the name of Harshavat&iacute;, and
in it there was a leading merchant named Dharmadatta, possessed of many
crores. And that merchant had a daughter named Vasudatt&aacute;,
matchless in beauty, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248"
name="pb248">248</a>]</span>whom he loved more than his life. And she
was given to an excellent young merchant named Samudradatta, equal to
her in rank, distinguished for wealth and youth, who was an object that
the eyes of lovely women loved to feast on, as the partridges on the
rays of the moon, and who dwelt in the city of T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;
which is inhabited by honourable men. Once on a time, the
merchant&rsquo;s daughter, while she was living in her father&rsquo;s
house, and her husband was in his own country, saw at a distance a
certain young and good-looking man. The fickle woman, deluded by
M&aacute;ra,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8239src" href="#xd27e8239"
name="xd27e8239src">3</a> invited him by means of a confidante, and
made him her secret paramour. And from that time forth she spent every
night with him, and her affections were fixed upon him only.</p>
<p>But one day the husband of her youth returned from his own land,
appearing to her parents like delight in bodily form. And on that day
of rejoicing she was adorned, but she would have nothing to say to her
husband in spite of her mother&rsquo;s injunctions, but when he spoke
to her, she pretended to be asleep, as her heart was fixed on another.
And then her husband, being drowsy with wine, and tired with his
journey, was overpowered by sleep. In the meanwhile, as all the people
of the house, having eaten and drunk, were fast asleep, a thief made a
hole in the wall and entered their apartment. At that very moment the
merchant&rsquo;s daughter rose up, without seeing the thief, and went
out secretly, having made an assignation with her lover. When the thief
saw that, his object being frustrated, he said to himself, &ldquo;She
has gone out in the dead of night adorned with those very ornaments
which I came here to steal; so I will watch where she goes.&rdquo; When
the thief had formed this intention, he went out, and followed that
merchant&rsquo;s daughter Vasudatt&aacute;, keeping an eye on her, but
himself unobserved.</p>
<p>But she, with flowers and other things of the kind in her hands,
went out, accompanied by a single confidante, who was in the secret,
and entered a garden at no great distance outside the city.</p>
<p>And in it she saw her lover, who had come there to meet her, hanging
dead on a tree, with a halter round his neck, for the city-guards had
caught him there at night and hanged him, on the supposition that he
was a thief. Then she was distracted and beside herself, and
exclaiming, &ldquo;I am ruined,&rdquo; she fell on the ground and
lamented with plaintive cries. Then she took down her dead paramour
from the tree, and placing him in a sitting position, she adorned him
with unguents and flowers, and though he was senseless, embraced him,
with mind blinded by passion and grief. And when in her sorrow she
raised up his mouth and kissed it, her dead paramour, being animated by
a Vet&aacute;la, suddenly bit off her nose. Then she left him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>in confusion and agony, but still the
unfortunate woman came back once more, and looked at him to see if he
was still alive. And when she saw that the Vet&aacute;la had left his
body, and that he was dead and motionless, she departed slowly, weeping
with fear and humiliation.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the thief, who was hidden there, saw all, and said
to himself, &ldquo;What is this that this wicked woman has done? Alas!
the mind of females is terrible and black like a dark well,
unfathomable, exceedingly deep for a fall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8252src" href="#xd27e8252" name="xd27e8252src">4</a> So I wonder
what she will do now.&rdquo; After these reflections, the thief again
followed her at a distance, out of curiosity.</p>
<p>She went on and entered her own chamber, where her husband was
asleep, and cried out weeping, &ldquo;Help! Help! This wicked enemy,
calling himself a husband, has cut off my nose, though I have done
nothing wrong.&rdquo; Then her husband, and her father, and the
servants, hearing her repeated cries, woke up, and arose in a state of
excitement. Then her father, seeing that her nose had been recently
taken off, was angry, and had her husband bound as having injured his
wife. But even while he was being bound, he remained speechless, like a
dumb man, and said nothing, for all the listeners, his father-in-law
and the others, had altogether turned against him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e8257src" href="#xd27e8257" name="xd27e8257src">5</a></p>
<p>When the thief had seen all this, he slipped away nimbly, and the
night, which was spent in tumult, gradually passed away, and then the
merchant&rsquo;s son was taken by his father-in-law to the king,
together with his wife who had been deprived of her nose. And the king,
after he had been informed by them of the circumstances, ordered the
execution of the young merchant, on the ground that he had maimed his
own wife, rejecting with contempt his version of the story. Then, as he
was being led to the place of execution, with drums beating, the thief
came up to the king&rsquo;s officers and said to them, &ldquo;You ought
not to put this man to death without cause; I know the circumstances,
take me to the king, that I may tell him the whole story.&rdquo; When
the thief said this, they took him to the king, and after he had
received a promise of pardon, he told him the whole history of the
night from the beginning. And he said, &ldquo;If your Majesty does not
believe my words, look at once at the woman&rsquo;s nose, which is in
the mouth of that corpse.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he sent
servants to look, and finding that the statement was true, he gave
orders that the young merchant should not suffer capital punishment.
But he banished his wicked wife from the country, after cutting off her
ears also, and punished his father-in-law by confiscating all his
wealth, and being pleased with the thief, he made him chief magistrate
of the city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see that females are naturally wicked and
treacherous.&rdquo; When the parrot had told this tale, the curse
imposed on him by Indra lost its force, and he became once more the
Gandharva Chitraratha, and assuming a celestial form, he went to
heaven. And at the same moment the <i lang="sa-latn">maina&rsquo;s</i>
curse came to an end, and she became the heavenly nymph
Tilottam&aacute;, and went at once to heaven. And so their dispute
remained undecided in the judgment-hall.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this tale, he again said to the
king, &ldquo;So let your Majesty decide, which are the worst, males or
females. But if you know and do not say, your head shall split in
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king was asked this question by the Vet&aacute;la, that was
on his shoulder, he said to him, &ldquo;Chief of magicians, women are
the worst. For it is possible that once in a way a man may be so
wicked, but females are, as a rule, always such everywhere.&rdquo; When
the king said this, the Vet&aacute;la disappeared, as before, from his
shoulder, and the king once more resumed the task of fetching him.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Oesterley tells us that in the Vet&aacute;la Cadai the
two stories are told by two parrots, and the same is the case in the
Turkish T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah, Rosen, 2, p. 92.</p>
<p>The 1st story is found in the Turkish
T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah. The principal difference is that the
parents of the extravagant man die after his first crime; after he has
spent his property, he begs in a cemetery, and is there recognized by
his wife; they live some time together, and then set out to return to
his house. On the way they pass the old well, and there he murders her.
There are some similar points in the 11th story of the Siddhik&uuml;r.
[See Sagas from the Far East, pp. 120&ndash;125.]</p>
<p>The second story is found in Babington&rsquo;s Vet&aacute;la Cadai,
p. 44. The lover receives a mortal wound, being taken for a thief, and
in the agony of death bites off the nose of the adulteress. She smears
her husband&rsquo;s betel-knife with the blood, and accuses him of the
murder. The city-guards clear the matter up.</p>
<p>The 2nd story is found in a very different form in the
Siddhik&uuml;r, No. 10; in J&uuml;lg, p. 100. [See Sagas from The Far
East, pp. 115&ndash;119.] Here a younger brother is not invited to
supper by an elder, so he determines to rob him out of revenge. He
observes his brother&rsquo;s wife go to a cemetery to see her dead
lover, who, when she tries to feed him by force, bites off her nose and
the tip of her tongue. Of course when she accuses her husband, the
younger brother reveals the secret.</p>
<p>The story in the Turkish T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah, Rosen, 2,
p. 96, Wickerhauser, p. 212, closely resembles Somadeva&rsquo;s. The
lovers are surprised by the city-guards, who crucify the man, and let
the woman go. The man in the agony of death bites her nose off, and she
accuses her husband of the deed; he is then condemned to lose his nose.
But a thief, who has crept into the house, and has then followed the
adulteress, reveals the secret, and the woman is thereupon drowned. The
story in the Panchatantra, Benfey, II, p. 40, only resembles this in
its conclusion. [See Johnson&rsquo;s Hitopade&#347;a, p. 85.] It is no
doubt a clever adaptation of the end of this story. The tale has been
traced through all its migrations by Benfey, Vol. I, p. 140.

<h3 class="main">Story of V&iacute;ravara.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city on the earth rightly named
&#346;obh&aacute;vat&iacute;. In it there lived a king of great valour,
called &#346;&uacute;draka. The fire of that victorious king&rsquo;s
might was perpetually fanned by the wind of the chowries waved by the
captured wives of his enemies. I ween that the earth was so glorious
during the reign of that king, owing to the uninterrupted practice of
righteousness that prevailed, that she forgot all her other sovereigns,
even R&aacute;ma.</p>
<p>Once on a time a Br&aacute;hman, of the name of V&iacute;ravara,
came from M&aacute;lava to take service under that king who loved
heroes. His wife&rsquo;s name was Dharmavat&iacute;, his son was
Sattvavara, and his daughter was V&iacute;ravat&iacute;. These three
composed his family; and his attendants were another three, at his side
a dagger, a sword in one hand, and a splendid shield in the other.
Although he had so small a retinue, he demanded from the king five
hundred <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e8312" title=
"Source: din&aacute;rs">d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</span></i> a day by way of
salary. And king &#346;&uacute;draka, perceiving that his appearance
indicated great courage, gave him the salary he desired. But he felt
curious to know whether, as his retinue was so small, he employed so
many gold coins to feed his vices, or lavished them on some worthy
object. So he had him secretly dogged by spies, in order to discover
his mode of life. And it turned out that every day V&iacute;ravara had
an interview with the king in the morning, and stood at his palace-gate
in the middle of the day, sword in hand; and then he went home and put
into the hand of his wife a hundred <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> of his
salary for food, and with a hundred he bought clothes, unguents and
betel; and after bathing, he set apart a hundred for the worship of
Vish&#7751;u and &#346;iva; and he gave two hundred by way of charity
to poor Br&aacute;hmans. This was the distribution which he made of the
five hundred every day. Then he fed the sacrificial fire with clarified
butter and performed other ceremonies, and took food, and then he again
went and kept guard at the gate of the palace alone at night, sword in
hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>When the king <span class="corr" id="xd27e8320"
title="Source: S&uacute;draka">&#346;&uacute;draka</span> heard from
his spies, that V&iacute;ravara always followed this righteous custom,
he rejoiced in his heart; and he ordered those spies, who had dogged
his path, to desist; and he considered him worthy of especial honour as
a distinguished hero.</p>
<p>Then in course of time, after V&iacute;ravara had easily tided
through the hot weather, when the rays of the sun were exceedingly
powerful, the monsoon came roaring, bearing a brandished sword of
lightning, as if out of envy against V&iacute;ravara, and
smiting<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8325src" href="#xd27e8325" name=
"xd27e8325src">1</a> with rain-drops. And though at that time a
terrible bank of clouds poured down rain day and night, V&iacute;ravara
remained motionless, as before, at the gate of the palace. And king
&#346;&uacute;draka, having beheld him in the day from the top of his
palace, again went up to it at night, to find out whether he was there
or not; and he cried out from it,&mdash;&ldquo;Who waits there at the
palace-gate?&rdquo; When V&iacute;ravara heard that, he answered,
&ldquo;I am here, your Majesty.&rdquo; Then king &#346;&uacute;draka
thought to himself, &ldquo;Ah! V&iacute;ravara is a man of intrepid
courage and devotedly attached to me. So I must certainly promote him
to an important post.&rdquo; After the king had said this to himself,
he came down from the roof of his palace, and entering his private
apartments, went to bed.</p>
<p>And the next evening, when a cloud was violently raining with a
heavy downfall, and black darkness was spread abroad, obscuring the
heaven,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8339src" href="#xd27e8339" name=
"xd27e8339src">2</a> the king once more ascended the roof of the palace
to satisfy his curiosity, and being alone, he cried out in a clear
voice, &ldquo;Who waits there at the palace-gate?&rdquo; Again
V&iacute;ravara said, &ldquo;I am here.&rdquo; And while the king was
lost in admiration at seeing his courage, he suddenly heard a woman
weeping in the distance, distracted with despair, uttering only the
piteous sound of wailing. When the king heard that, pity arose in his
mind, and he said to himself, &ldquo;There is no oppressed person in my
kingdom, no poor or afflicted person; so who is this woman, that is
thus weeping alone at night?&rdquo; Then he gave this order to
V&iacute;ravara, who was alone below, &ldquo;Listen, V&iacute;ravara;
there is some woman weeping in the distance; go and find out who she is
and why she is weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When V&iacute;ravara heard that, he said, &ldquo;I will do
so,&rdquo; and set out thence with his dagger in his belt, and his
sword in his hand. He looked upon the world as a R&aacute;kshasa black
with fresh clouds, having the lightning flashing from them by way of an
eye, raining large drops of rain instead of stones. And king
&#346;&uacute;draka, seeing him starting alone on such a night, and
being penetrated with pity and curiosity, came down from the top of the
palace, and taking his sword, set out close behind him, alone and
unobserved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>And V&iacute;ravara went on persistently in the
direction of the weeping, and reached a tank outside the city, and saw
there that woman in the middle of the water uttering this lament,
&ldquo;Hero! merciful man! Generous man! How can I live without
you?&rdquo; And V&iacute;ravara, who was followed by the king, said
with astonishment, &ldquo;Who are you, and why do you thus
weep?&rdquo;&mdash;Then she answered him, &ldquo;Dear V&iacute;ravara,
know that I am this earth, and king &#346;&uacute;draka is now my
righteous lord, but on the third day from this his death will take
place, and whence shall I obtain such another lord? So I am grieved,
and bewail both him and myself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8351src" href="#xd27e8351" name="xd27e8351src">3</a> When
V&iacute;ravara heard this, he said, like one alarmed, &ldquo;Is there
then, goddess, any expedient to prevent the death of this king, who is
the protecting amulet of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the earth heard this, she answered, &ldquo;There is one
expedient for averting it, and one which you alone can employ.&rdquo;
Then V&iacute;ravara said,&mdash;&ldquo;Then, goddess, tell it me at
once, in order that I may quickly put it in operation: otherwise what
is the use of my life?&rdquo; When the earth heard this, she
said,&mdash;&ldquo;Who is as brave as you, and as devoted to his
master? So hear this method of bringing about his welfare. If you offer
up your child Sattvavara to this glorious goddess
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, famous for her exceeding readiness to
manifest herself to her votaries, to whom the king has built a
temple<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8359src" href="#xd27e8359" name=
"xd27e8359src">4</a> in the immediate vicinity of his palace, the king
will not die, but live another hundred years. And if you do it at once,
his safety will be ensured, but if not, he will assuredly have ceased
to live on the third day from this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the goddess Earth said this to V&iacute;ravara, he said,
&ldquo;Goddess, I will go, and do it this very instant.&rdquo; Then
Earth said, &ldquo;May success attend you!&rdquo; and disappeared; and
the king, who was secretly following V&iacute;ravara, heard all
this.</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara went quickly in the darkness to his own house,
and king &#346;&uacute;draka, out of curiosity, followed him
unobserved. There he woke up his wife Dharmavat&iacute;, and told her
how the goddess Earth had directed him to offer up his son for the sake
of the king. When she heard it, she said, &ldquo;My lord, we must
ensure the prosperity of the king; so wake up this young boy of ours
and tell it him yourself.&rdquo; Then V&iacute;ravara woke up his young
son Sattvavara, who was asleep, and told him what had occurred, and
said to him, &ldquo;So, my son, the king will live if you are offered
up to the goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, but if not, he will die on
the third day.&rdquo; When Sattvavara heard it, though he was a mere
child, he shewed a heroic soul, and justified his name.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8369src" href="#xd27e8369" name="xd27e8369src">5</a>
He said &ldquo;I shall have obtained all I desire, if the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>sacrifice of my life saves that of the king, for
so I shall have repaid him for his food which I have eaten. So why
should there be any delay? Take me and offer me up immediately before
the adorable goddess. Let me be the means of bringing about the
happiness of my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sattvavara said this, V&iacute;ravara answered, &ldquo;Bravo!
you are in truth my own son.&rdquo; And the king, who had followed
them, and heard all this conversation from outside, said to himself,
&ldquo;Ah! they are all equal in courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara took his son Sattvavara on his shoulder, and
his wife Dharmavat&iacute; took their daughter V&iacute;ravat&iacute;,
and they both went that very night to the temple of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, and king &#346;&uacute;draka followed them
unobserved. Then Sattvavara was taken down by his father from his
shoulder, and placed in front of the idol, and the boy, who was full of
courage, bowed before the goddess, and said, &ldquo;May the sacrifice
of my head ensure the life of king &#346;&uacute;draka! May he rule
unopposed, goddess, for another hundred years!&rdquo; When the boy
Sattvavara said this, V&iacute;ravara exclaimed, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;
and drew his sword and cut off his son&rsquo;s head, and offered it to
the goddess, saying, &ldquo;May the sacrifice of my son save the
king&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;&mdash;Immediately a voice was heard from the
air, &ldquo;Bravo! V&iacute;ravara! What man is as devoted to his
sovereign as thou, who, by the sacrifice of thy noble only son, hast
bestowed on this king &#346;&uacute;draka life and a kingdom?&rdquo;
Then that young girl V&iacute;ravat&iacute;, the daughter of
V&iacute;ravara, came up, and embraced the head of her slain brother,
and weeping, blinded with excessive grief, she broke her heart and so
died. And the king saw and heard all this from his concealment.</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara&rsquo;s wife Dharmavat&iacute; said to him,
&ldquo;We have ensured the prosperity of the king, so now I have
something to say to you. Since my daughter, though a child and knowing
nothing, has died out of grief for her brother, and I have lost these
two children of mine, what is the use of life to me? Since I have been
so foolish as not to offer my own head long ago to the goddess for the
welfare of the king, give me leave to enter the fire with my
children&rsquo;s bodies.&rdquo; When she urged this request,
V&iacute;ravara said to her, &ldquo;Do so, and may prosperity attend
you, for what pleasure could you find, noble woman, in continuing a
life, that would for you be full of nothing but grief for your
children. But do not be afflicted, because you did not sacrifice
yourself. Would not I have sacrificed myself, if the object could have
been attained by the sacrifice of any victim but our son? So wait until
I have made a pyre for you with these pieces of timber, collected to
build the fence round the sanctuary of the goddess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When V&iacute;ravara had said this, he made a funeral pyre with the
timber, and placed on it the bodies of his two children, and lighted it
with the flame of a lamp. Then his virtuous wife Dharmavat&iacute; fell
at his feet, and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255"
name="pb255">255</a>]</span>after worshipping the goddess
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, she addressed to her this prayer, &ldquo;May
my present husband be my husband also in a future birth! And may the
sacrifice of my life procure prosperity for the king his master!&rdquo;
When the virtuous woman had said this, she threw herself fearlessly
into the burning pyre, from which the flames streamed up like hair.</p>
<p>Then the hero V&iacute;ravara said to himself, &ldquo;I have done
what the king&rsquo;s interests required, as the celestial voice
testified, and I have paid my debt to my master for his food which I
have eaten: so, as I am now left alone, why should I thus cling to
life? It does not look well for a man like me to nurse his own life
only, after sacrificing all his dear family, which it is his duty to
maintain. So why should I not gratify Durg&aacute; by sacrificing
myself?&rdquo; Having thus reflected, he first approached the goddess
with this hymn of praise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, thou slayer of the Asura Mahisha, destroyer of
the D&aacute;nava Ruru, trident-bearing goddess! Hail to thee, best of
mothers, that causest rejoicing among the gods, and upholdest the three
worlds! Hail thou whose feet are worshipped by the whole earth, the
refuge of those that are intent on final beatitude! Hail thou that
wearest the rays of the sun, and dispellest the accumulated darkness of
calamity! Hail to thee, K&aacute;l&iacute;, skull-bearing goddess,
wearer of skeletons! Hail, &#346;iv&aacute;! Honour to thee! Be
propitious now to king &#346;&uacute;draka on account of the sacrifice
of my head!&rdquo; After V&iacute;ravara had praised the goddess in
these words, he cut off his head with a sudden stroke of his sword.</p>
<p>King &#346;&uacute;draka, who was a witness of all this from his
place of concealment, was full of bewilderment, sorrow, and
astonishment, and said to himself, &ldquo;This worthy man and his
family have performed for my sake a wonderful and difficult exploit
never seen or heard of anywhere else. Though the world is wide and
various, where could there be found a man so resolute as secretly to
sacrifice his life for his master, without proclaiming the fact abroad?
And if I do not requite this benefit, what is the use of my
sovereignty, and of my protracting my life, which would only be like
that of an animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the heroic king had thus reflected, he drew his sword from the
sheath, and approaching the goddess, prayed thus to her, &ldquo;Be
propitious to me now, goddess, on account of this sacrifice of my head,
and confer a boon on me, thy constant votary. Let this Br&aacute;hman
V&iacute;ravara, whose acts are in accordance with his name, and who
sacrificed his life for my sake, be resuscitated with his
family!&rdquo; After uttering this prayer, king &#346;&uacute;draka was
preparing to cut off his head with his sword, but at that moment a
voice was heard from the air, &ldquo;Do not act rashly; I am pleased
with this courage of thine; let the Br&aacute;hman V&iacute;ravara be
restored to life, together with his wife and his
children!&rdquo;&mdash;Having uttered so much, the voice ceased,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>and V&iacute;ravara rose up alive and unwounded,
with his son, his daughter, and his wife. When the king, who quickly
concealed himself again, saw that marvel, he was never tired of looking
at them with an eye full of tears of joy.</p>
<p>And V&iacute;ravara quickly awoke as if from sleep, and, beholding
his children and wife alive, and also himself, he was confused in mind.
And he asked his wife and children, addressing them severally by name,
&ldquo;How have you returned to life after having been reduced to
ashes? I too cut off my head: what is the meaning of my being now
alive? Is this a delusion, or the manifest favour of the
goddess?&rdquo; When he said this, his wife and children answered him,
&ldquo;Our being alive is due to a merciful interposition of the
goddess, of which we were not conscious.&rdquo; Then V&iacute;ravara
came to the conclusion that it was so, and after worshipping the
goddess, he returned home with his wife and children, having
accomplished his object.</p>
<p>And after he had left his son, wife, and daughter there, he returned
that very night to the palace-gate of the king, and stood there as
before. King &#346;&uacute;draka, for his part, who had beheld all
unobserved, again went up to the roof of his palace. And he cried out
from the roof, &ldquo;Who is in attendance at the palace-gate?&rdquo;
Then V&iacute;ravara said, &ldquo;I myself am in waiting here, your
Majesty. And in accordance with your orders I went in search of that
woman, but she disappeared somewhere as soon as seen, like a
R&aacute;kshas&iacute;.&rdquo; When the king heard the speech of that
V&iacute;ravara, he was very much astonished, as he had himself seen
what took place, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Indeed people of noble
spirit are deep and self-contained of soul as the sea, for when they
have performed an unparalleled exploit, they do not utter any
description of it.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the king silently descended
from the roof of the palace, and entered his private apartments, and
there spent the rest of the night.</p>
<p>And the next morning, V&iacute;ravara came to present himself at the
time of audience, and then the delighted king related to the ministers
all that V&iacute;ravara had gone through during the night, so that
they were all, as it were, thunderstruck with wonder. Then the king
gave to V&iacute;ravara and his son the sovereignty over the provinces
of L&aacute;&#7789;a and Kar&#7751;&aacute;&#7789;a, as a token of his
regard. Then the two kings, V&iacute;ravara and &#346;&uacute;draka,
being equal in power, lived happily in the interchange of mutual good
offices.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this exceedingly wonderful story, he
went on to say to king Trivikramasena, &ldquo;So tell me, king, who was
the bravest of all these, and if you know and do not tell, the curse,
which I before mentioned, shall descend upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this, he answered the Vet&aacute;la, &ldquo;King
&#346;&uacute;draka was the greatest hero of them all.&rdquo; Then the
Vet&aacute;la said, &ldquo;Was not V&iacute;ravara greater, for his
equal is not found on this earth? And was not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>his
wife braver, who, though a mother, endured to witness with her own eyes
the offering up of her son as a victim? And was not his son Sattvavara
braver, who, though a mere child, displayed such pre&euml;minent
courage? So why do you say that king &#346;&uacute;draka was more
heroic than these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la said this, the king answered him, &ldquo;Do
not say so! V&iacute;ravara was a man of high birth, one in whose
family it was a tradition that life, son, and wife must be sacrificed
to protect the sovereign. And his wife also was of good birth, chaste,
worshipping her husband only, and her chief duty was to follow the path
traced out for her by her husband. And Sattvavara was like them, being
their son; assuredly, such as are the threads, such is the web produced
from them. But &#346;&uacute;draka excelled them all, because he was
ready to lay down his life for those servants, by the sacrifice of
whose lives kings are wont to save their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard that speech from that king, he at once
left his shoulder, and returned invisibly to his former place by his
supernatural power, but the king resolutely set out on his former path
in that cemetery at night to bring him back again.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Somaprabh&aacute; and her three suitors.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Ujjayin&iacute; there lived an excellent
Br&aacute;hman, the dear dependent and minister of king
Pu&#7751;yasena, and his name was Harisv&aacute;min. That householder
had by his wife, who was his equal in birth, an excellent son like
himself, Devasv&aacute;min by name. And he also had born to him a
daughter, famed for her matchless beauty, rightly named
Somaprabh&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8440src" href=
"#xd27e8440" name="xd27e8440src">1</a> When the time came for that girl
to be given away in marriage, as she was proud of her exceeding beauty,
she made her mother give the following message to her father and
brother, &ldquo;I am to be given in marriage to a man possessed of
heroism<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> or knowledge,
or magic power;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8448src" href="#xd27e8448"
name="xd27e8448src">2</a> you must not give me in marriage to any
other, if you value my life.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When her father Harisv&aacute;min heard this, he was full of
anxiety, trying to find for her a husband coming under one of these
three categories. And while so engaged, he was sent as ambassador by
king Pu&#7751;yasena to negotiate a treaty with a king of the Dekkan,
who had come to invade him. And when he had accomplished the object,
for which he was sent, a noble Br&aacute;hman, who had heard of the
great beauty of his daughter, came and asked him for her hand.
Harisv&aacute;min said to the Br&aacute;hman suitor, &ldquo;My daughter
will not have any husband who does not possess either valour,
knowledge, or magic power; so tell me which of the three you
possess.&rdquo; When Harisv&aacute;min said this to the Br&aacute;hman
suitor, he answered, &ldquo;I possess magic power.&rdquo; Thereupon
Harisv&aacute;min rejoined, &ldquo;Then shew me your magic
power.&rdquo; So that possessor of supernatural power immediately
prepared by his skill a chariot that would fly through the air. And in
a moment he took Harisv&aacute;min up in that magic chariot, and shewed
him heaven and all the worlds. And he brought him back delighted to
that very camp of the king of the Dekkan, to which he had been sent on
business. Then Harisv&aacute;min promised his daughter to that man
possessed of magic power, and fixed the marriage for the seventh day
from that time.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile another Br&aacute;hman, in Ujjayin&iacute;,
came and asked Harisv&aacute;min&rsquo;s son Devasv&aacute;min for the
hand of his sister. Devasv&aacute;min answered, &ldquo;She does not
wish to have a husband who is not possessed of either knowledge, or
magic power, or heroism.&rdquo; Thereupon he declared himself to be a
hero. And when the hero displayed his skill in the use of missiles and
hand-to-hand weapons, Devasv&aacute;min promised to give him his
sister, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>was younger than himself. And by the advice of
the astrologers he told him, as his father had told the other suitor,
that the marriage should take place on that very same seventh day, and
this decision he came to without the knowledge of his mother.</p>
<p>At that very same time a third person came to his mother, the wife
of Harisv&aacute;min, and asked her privately for the hand of her
daughter. She said to him, &ldquo;Our daughter requires a husband who
possesses either knowledge, or heroism, or magic power;&rdquo; and he
answered, &ldquo;Mother, I possess knowledge.&rdquo; And she, after
questioning him about the past and the future, promised to give the
hand of her daughter to that possessor of supernatural knowledge on
that same seventh day.</p>
<p>The next day Harisv&aacute;min returned home, and told his wife and
his son the agreement he had made to give away his daughter in
marriage; and they told him separately the promises that they had made;
and that made him feel anxious, as three bridegrooms had been
invited.</p>
<p>Then, on the wedding-day, three bridegrooms arrived in
Harisv&aacute;min&rsquo;s house, the man of knowledge, the man of magic
power, and the man of valour. And at that moment a strange thing took
place: the intended bride, the maiden Somaprabh&aacute;, was found to
have disappeared in some inexplicable manner, and though searched for,
was not found. Then Harisv&aacute;min said eagerly to the possessor of
knowledge; &ldquo;Man of knowledge, now tell me quickly where my
daughter is gone.&rdquo; When the possessor of knowledge heard that, he
said, &ldquo;The R&aacute;kshasa Dh&uacute;mra&#347;ikha has carried
her off to his own habitation in the Vindhya forest.&rdquo; When the
man of knowledge said this to Harisv&aacute;min, he was terrified and
said, &ldquo;Alas! Alas! How are we to get her back, and how is she to
be married?&rdquo; When the possessor of magic power heard that, he
said, &ldquo;Be of good cheer! I will take you in a moment to the place
where the possessor of knowledge says that she is.&rdquo; After he had
said this, he prepared, as before, a chariot that would fly through the
air, provided with all kinds of weapons, and made Harisv&aacute;min,
and the man of knowledge, and the brave man get into it, and in a
moment he carried them to the habitation of the R&aacute;kshasa in the
Vindhya forest, which had been described by the man of knowledge. The
R&aacute;kshasa, when he saw what had happened, rushed out in a
passion, and then the hero, who was put forward by Harisv&aacute;min,
challenged him to fight. Then a wonderful fight took place between that
man and that R&aacute;kshasa, who were contending for a woman with
various kinds of weapons, like R&aacute;ma and R&aacute;va&#7751;a. And
in a short time the hero cut off the head of that R&aacute;kshasa with
a crescent-headed arrow, though he was a doughty champion. When the
R&aacute;kshasa was slain, they carried off Somaprabh&aacute; whom they
found in his house, and they all returned in the chariot of the suitor
who possessed magic power. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they had reached Harisv&aacute;min&rsquo;s house, the marriage
did not go forward, though the auspicious moment had arrived, but a
great dispute arose between the man of knowledge, the man of magic
power, and the man of valour. The man of knowledge said, &ldquo;If I
had not known where this maiden was, how would she have been discovered
when concealed?&mdash;So she ought to be given to me.&rdquo; But the
man of magic power said, &ldquo;If I had not made this chariot that can
fly through the air, how could you all have gone and returned in a
moment like gods? And how could you, without a chariot, have fought
with a R&aacute;kshasa, who possessed a chariot? So you ought to give
her to me for I have secured by my skill this auspicious moment.&rdquo;
The brave man said, &ldquo;If I had not slain the R&aacute;kshasa in
fight, who would have brought this maiden back here in spite of all
your exertions? So she must be given to me.&rdquo; While they went on
wrangling in this style, Harisv&aacute;min remained for a moment
silent, being perplexed in mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So tell me, king, to whom she ought to have been given, and
if you know and do not say, your head shall split asunder.&rdquo; When
Trivikramasena heard this from the Vet&aacute;la, he abandoned his
silence, and said to him; &ldquo;She ought to be given to the brave
man; for he won her by the might of his arms, at the risk of his life,
slaying that R&aacute;kshasa in combat. But the man of knowledge and
the man of magic power were appointed by the Creator to serve as his
instruments; are not calculators and artificers always subordinate
assistants to others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard this answer of the king&rsquo;s, he
left his seat on the top of his shoulder, and went, as before, to his
own place; and the king again set out to find him, without being in the
slightest degree discomposed.</p>

<h3 class="main">Note.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The above story bears a slight resemblance to No. 71
in Grimm&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Kinder- und Hausm&auml;rchen</span>,
<i lang="de">Sechse kommen durch die ganze Welt</i>; see the note in
the 3rd volume of the third edition, page 120. Cp. also the 74th story
in Laura Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Sicilianische
M&auml;rchen</span>, Part II, page 96, and the 45th story in the same
book, Part I, p. 305, with K&ouml;hler&rsquo;s notes. The 9th story in
Sagas from the Far East, p. 105, is no doubt the Mongolian form of the
tale in our text. It bears a very strong resemblance to the 47th tale
in the Pentamerone of Basile, (see Liebrecht&rsquo;s translation, Vol.
II, p. 212,) and to Das weise Urtheil in Waldau&rsquo;s <span lang=
"de">B&ouml;hmische M&auml;rchen</span>. In this tale there are three
rival brothers; one has a magic mirror, another a magic chariot, a
third three magic apples. The first finds out that the lady is
desperately ill, the second takes himself and his rivals to her, the
third raises her to life. An old man decides that the third should have
her, as his apples were consumed as medicine, while the other two have
still their chariot and mirror respectively. Oesterley refers us to
Benfey&rsquo;s articles in Ausland, 1858, pp. 969, 995, 1017, 1038,
1067, in which this story is treated in a masterly and exhaustive
manner. He compares a story in the Siddhik&uuml;r, No. 1, p. 55, in
J&uuml;lg&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>version, which seems to be the one above
referred to in Sagas from the Far East. The 22nd story in the Persian
T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah (Iken, p. 93,) which is found with
little variation in the Turkish T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah (Rosen,
II, p. 165,) closely resembles the story in our text. The only
difference is that a magic horse does duty for a magic chariot, and the
lady is carried away by fairies. There is a story in the
T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah which seems to be made up of No. 2, No.
5 and No. 21 in this collection. [No. 22, in Somadeva.] It is No. 4 in
the Persian T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah, (Iken, p. 37,) and is also
found in the Turkish version, (Rosen I, p. 151.) The lady is the work
of four companions. A carpenter hews a figure out of wood, a goldsmith
adorns it with gems, a tailor clothes it, and a monk animates it with
life. They quarrel about her, and lay the matter before a Dervish. He
avows that he is her husband. The head of the police does the same, and
the Kazi, to whom it is then referred, takes the same line. At last the
matter is referred to a divinity, and the lady is again reduced to
wood. This form is the exaggeration of a story in Ardschi Bordschi
translated by Benfey in Ausland, 1858, p. 845, (cp. G&ouml;ttinger gel.
Anz. 1858, p. 1517, Benfey&rsquo;s Panchatantra, Vol. I, p. 490 and
<i>ff.</i>) A shepherd boy hews a female figure out of wood, a second
paints her, a third improves her [by giving her wit and understanding,
according to Sagas from the Far East,] a fourth gives her life. Naran
D&aacute;kin&iacute; awards her to the last. (Oesterley&rsquo;s
Bait&aacute;l Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pp. 192&ndash;194). The story in
Ardschi Bordschi will be found in Sagas from the Far East, pp.
298&ndash;303. The story which Oesterley quotes from the <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e8498" title=
"Source: Tut&iacute;n&aacute;mah">T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah</span>
is still found in Bannu, as appears from a review of Mr.
Thorburn&rsquo;s book in Melusine (1878), p. 179. The reviewer, M. Loys
Brueyre, tells us that it is found in the Bohemian tales of Erben under
the title, Wisdom and Fortune.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the lady who caused her brother and husband
to change heads.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a king famous on the earth by the name of
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, and his capital was a city of the name of
&#346;obh&aacute;vat&iacute;. And in that city there was a splendid
temple of Gaur&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8516src" href=
"#xd27e8516" name="xd27e8516src">1</a> and to the south of it there was
a lake, called Gaur&iacute;t&iacute;rtha. And every year, during a
feast on the fourteenth day of the white fortnight of the month
&Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;ha, large crowds came there to bathe from
every part of the world.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8519src" href=
"#xd27e8519" name="xd27e8519src">2</a></p>
<p>And once there came there to bathe, on that day, a young washerman
of the name of Dhavala, from a village called Brahmasthala. He saw
there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>the virgin daughter of a man named
&#346;uddhapa&#7789;a, a girl called Madanasundar&iacute;, who had come
to bathe in the sacred water.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8529src" href=
"#xd27e8529" name="xd27e8529src">3</a> His heart was captivated by that
girl who eclipsed the beauty of the moon, and after he had enquired her
name and family, he went home love-smitten. There he remained fasting
and restless without her, but when his mother asked him the cause, he
told her the truth about his desire.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8535src" href="#xd27e8535" name="xd27e8535src">4</a> She went and
told her husband Vimala, and when he came, and saw his son in that
state, he said to him, &ldquo;Why are you so despondent, my son, about
an object so easily attained? &#346;uddhapa&#7789;a will give you his
daughter, if I ask him. For we are equal to him in family, wealth, and
occupation; I know him and he knows me; so this is not a difficult
matter for me to arrange.&rdquo; With these words Vimala comforted his
son, and induced him to take food, and other refreshments, and the next
day he went with him to the house of &#346;uddhapa&#7789;a. And there
he asked his daughter in marriage for his son Dhavala, and
&#346;uddhapa&#7789;a courteously promised to give her. And so, after
ascertaining the auspicious moment, he gave his daughter
Madanasundar&iacute;, who was of equal birth with Dhavala, in marriage
to him the next day. And after Dhavala had been married, he returned a
happy man to his father&rsquo;s house, together with his wife, who had
fallen in love with him at first sight.</p>
<p>And one day, while he was living there in happiness, his
father-in-law&rsquo;s son, the brother of Madanasundar&iacute;, came
there. All received him courteously,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8546src" href="#xd27e8546" name="xd27e8546src">5</a> and his
sister embraced him and welcomed him, and his connections asked him how
he was, and at last, after he had rested, he said to them, &ldquo;I
have been sent here by my father, to invite Madanasundar&iacute; and
his son-in-law, since we are engaged in a festival in honour of the
goddess Durg&aacute;.&rdquo; And all his connections and their family
approved his speech, and entertained him that day with appropriate
meats and drinks.</p>
<p>Early the next day Dhavala set out for his father-in-law&rsquo;s
house, with Madanasundar&iacute; and his brother-in-law. And he reached
with his two companions the city of &#346;obh&aacute;vat&iacute;, and
he saw the great temple of Durg&aacute;, when he arrived near it; and
then he said to his wife and brother-in-law, in a fit of pious
devotion, &ldquo;Come and let us visit the shrine of this awful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>goddess.&rdquo; When the brother-in-law heard
this, he said to him, in order to dissuade him, &ldquo;How can so many
of us approach the goddess empty-handed?&rdquo; Then Dhavala said,
&ldquo;Let me go alone, and you can wait outside.&rdquo; When he had
said this, he went off to pay his respects to the goddess.</p>
<p>When he had entered her temple, and had worshipped, and had
meditated upon that goddess, who with her eighteen mighty arms had
smitten terrible D&aacute;navas, and who had flung under the lotus of
her foot and trampled to pieces the Asura Mahisha, a train of pious
reflection was produced in his mind by the impulse of Destiny, and he
said to himself, &ldquo;People worship this goddess with various
sacrifices of living creatures, so why should not I, to obtain
salvation, appease her with the sacrifice of myself?&rdquo; After he
had said this to himself, he took from her inner shrine, which was
empty of worshippers, a sword which had been long ago offered to her by
some pilgrims, and, after fastening his own head by his hair to the
chain of the bell, he cut it off with the sword, and when cut off, it
fell on the ground.</p>
<p>And his brother-in-law, after waiting a long time, without his
having returned, went into that very temple of the goddess to look for
him. But when he saw his sister&rsquo;s husband lying there
decapitated, he also was bewildered, and he cut off his head in the
same way with that very same sword.</p>
<p>And when he too did not return, Madanasundar&iacute; was distracted
in mind, and then she too entered the temple of the goddess. And when
she had gone in, and seen her husband and her brother in such a state,
she fell on the ground, exclaiming, &ldquo;Alas! what is the meaning of
this? I am ruined.&rdquo; And soon she rose up, and lamented those two
that had been so unexpectedly slain, and said to herself, &ldquo;Of
what use is this life of mine to me now?&rdquo; and being eager to
abandon the body, she said to that goddess, &ldquo;O thou that art the
chief divinity presiding over blessedness, chastity, and holy rule,
though occupying half the body of thy husband &#346;iva,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8564src" href="#xd27e8564" name="xd27e8564src">6</a>
thou that art the fitting refuge of all women, that takest away grief,
why hast thou robbed me at once of my brother and my husband? This is
not fitting on thy part towards me, for I have ever been a faithful
votary of thine. So hear one piteous appeal from me who fly to thee for
protection. I am now about to abandon this body which is afflicted with
calamity, but grant that in all my future births, whatever they may be,
these two men may be my husband and brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these words she praised and supplicated the goddess, and bowed
before her again, and then she made a noose of a creeper and fastened
it to an <i lang="sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree. And while she was
stretching out her neck, and putting it into the noose, the following
words resounded from the expanse of air: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>&ldquo;Do not act
rashly, my daughter! I am pleased with the exceeding courage which thou
hast displayed, though a mere girl; let this noose be, but join the
heads of thy husband and thy brother to their bodies, and by virtue of
my favour they shall both rise up alive.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8580src" href="#xd27e8580" name="xd27e8580src">7</a></p>
<p>When the girl Madanasundar&iacute; heard this, she let the noose
drop, and went up to the corpses in great delight, but being confused,
and not seeing in her excessive eagerness what she was doing, she
stuck, as fate would have it, her husband&rsquo;s head on to her
brother&rsquo;s trunk, and her brother&rsquo;s head on to her
husband&rsquo;s trunk, and then they both rose up alive, with limbs
free from wound, but from their heads having been exchanged their
bodies had become mixed together.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8593src"
href="#xd27e8593" name="xd27e8593src">8</a></p>
<p>Then they told one another what had befallen them, and were happy,
and after they had worshipped the goddess Durg&aacute;, the three
continued their journey. But Madanasundar&iacute;, as she was going
along, saw that she had changed their heads, and she was bewildered and
puzzled as to what course to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So tell me, king, which of the two people, thus mixed
together, was her husband; and if you know and do not tell, the curse
previously denounced shall fall on you!&rdquo; When king Trivikramasena
heard this tale and this question from the Vet&aacute;la, he answered
him as follows: &ldquo;That one of the two, on whom her husband&rsquo;s
head was fixed, was her husband, for the head is the chief of the
limbs, and personal identity depends upon it.&rdquo; When the king had
said this, the Vet&aacute;la again left his shoulder unperceived, and
the king again set out to fetch him.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the king who married his dependent to the
Nereid.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city on the shore of the eastern sea, named
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;; in that city there was a king of the name of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha; he turned away his face from the wives of
others, but not from battle-fields; he carried off the fortune of his
foes, but not the wealth of his neighbours.</p>
<p>Once on a time a popular R&aacute;jp&uacute;t of the Dekkan, named
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, came to the palace-gate of that king. And he
announced himself, and then, on account of his poverty, he and some
other R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts tore a ragged garment in the presence of
that king. Thus he became a dependent,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8629src" href="#xd27e8629" name="xd27e8629src">1</a> and remained
there for many years perpetually serving the king, but he never
received any reward from him. And he said to himself, &ldquo;If I have
been born in a royal race, why am I so poor? And considering my poverty
is so great, why did the Creator make my ambition so vast? For though I
serve the king so diligently, and my followers are sorely afflicted,
and I have long been pining with hunger, he has never, up to the
present time, deigned to notice me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While such were the reflections of the dependent, the king one day
went out to hunt. And he went, surrounded with horses and footmen, to
the forest of wild beasts, while his dependent ran in front of him
bearing a stick. And after he had hunted for some time, he followed up
closely a boar that had escaped, and soon he reached another distant
wood. And in that vast jungle, where the path was obscured with leaves
and grass, the king lost the boar, and he became exhausted, and was
unable to find his way. And the dependent was the only one that kept up
with him, running on foot, regardless of his own life, tortured with
hunger and thirst, though the king was mounted upon a horse swift as
the wind. And the king, when he saw that the dependent had followed
him, in spite of his being in such a condition, said to him in a kind
voice, &ldquo;Do you know the way by which we came?&rdquo; When the
dependent heard that, he put his hands together in an attitude of
supplication, and said, &ldquo;I do know it, but let <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>my
lord rest here for some time. For the sun, which is the centre-jewel of
the girdle of the sky-bride, is now burning fiercely with all its rays
flickering forth.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he said to him
graciously, &ldquo;Then see if you can find water anywhere here.&rdquo;
The dependent said, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and he climbed up a high
tree, and saw a river, and then he came down again, and led the king to
it. And he took the saddle off his horse, and let him roll, and gave
him water and mouthfuls of grass, and so refreshed him. And when the
king had bathed, he brought out of a corner of his garment
delicious<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8642src" href="#xd27e8642" name=
"xd27e8642src">2</a> <i lang="sa-latn">&aacute;malaka</i> fruits, and
washed them, and gave them to him. And when the king asked where he got
them, he said to him kneeling with the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&aacute;malakas</i> in his hand, &ldquo;Ten years have now
passed since I, living continually on these fruits, have been
performing, in order to propitiate my sovereign, the vow of a hermit
that does not dwell in solitude.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he
answered him, &ldquo;It cannot be denied that you are rightly named
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la.&rdquo; And being filled with compassion and
shame, he said to himself; &ldquo;Fie on kings who do not see who among
their servants is comfortable or miserable, and fie on their courtiers
who do not inform them of such matters!&rdquo; Such were the
king&rsquo;s thoughts, but he was at last induced by the importunity of
the dependent to take two <i lang="sa-latn">&aacute;malakas</i> from
him. And after eating them and drinking water, he rested for a while in
the company of the dependent, having satiated his hunger and thirst on
fruits and water.</p>
<p>Then his dependent got his horse ready, and he mounted it, and the
dependent went in front of him to shew him the way, but however much
the king entreated him, he would not get up on the horse behind him,
and so the king returned to his own city, meeting his army on the way.
There he proclaimed the devotion of the dependent, and he loaded him
with wealth and territories, and did not consider even then that he had
recompensed him as he deserved. Then Sattva&#347;&iacute;la became a
prosperous man, and discarding the life of a dependent, he remained
henceforth about the person of king <span class="corr" id="xd27e8661"
title=
"Source: Cha&#7751;&#7693;asena">Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha</span>.</p>
<p>And one day the king sent him to the island of Ceylon, to demand for
him the hand of the king&rsquo;s daughter. He had to go there by sea;
so he worshipped his patron divinity, and went on board a ship with the
Br&aacute;hmans, whom the king appointed to accompany him. And when the
ship had gone half-way, there suddenly rose from the sea a banner that
excited the wonder of all in the ship. It was so lofty that its top
touched the clouds, it was made of gold, and emblazoned like a waving
flag of various hues. And at that very moment a bank of clouds suddenly
arose, and began to pour down rain, and a mighty wind blew. And the
ship was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>forced on to that flag by the rain and the wind,
and thus fastened to it, as elephant-drivers force on an elephant and
bind him to a post. And then the flag began to sink with the ship in
the billowy sea.</p>
<p>And then the Br&aacute;hmans in the ship, distracted with fear,
called on their king Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, crying out for help. And
when Sattva&#347;&iacute;la heard their cries, so great was his
devotion to his master that he could not restrain himself, but with his
sword in his hand, and his upper garment girded round him, the brave
fellow daringly plunged into the billows, following the flag, in order
to counteract the violence of the sea, not suspecting the real cause.
And as soon as he had plunged in, that ship was carried to a distance
by the wind and waves, and all the people, who were in it, fell into
the mouths of the sea-monsters.</p>
<p>And when Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, who had fallen into the sea, began
to look about him, he found that he was in a splendid city,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8672src" href="#xd27e8672" name="xd27e8672src">3</a>
but he could not see the sea anywhere. That city glittered with palaces
of gold supported on pillars of jewels, and was adorned with gardens in
which were tanks with steps of precious gems, and in it he beheld the
temple of Durg&aacute;, lofty as mount Meru, with many walls of costly
stone, and with a soaring banner studded with jewels. There he
prostrated himself before the goddess, and praised her with a hymn, and
sat down wondering whether it was all the effect of enchantment.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile a heavenly maiden suddenly opened a door, and
issued from a bright enclosure in front of the temple of the goddess.
Her eyes were like blue lotuses, her face full-blown, her smile like a
flower, her body was soft like the taper fibre of a water-lily&rsquo;s
root, so that she resembled a moving lotus-lake. And waited on by a
thousand ladies, she entered the inner shrine of the goddess and the
heart of Sattva&#347;&iacute;la at the same time. And after she had
worshipped, she left the inner shrine of the goddess, but nothing would
make her leave the heart of Sattva&#347;&iacute;la. And she entered
once more into the shining enclosure, and Sattva&#347;&iacute;la
entered after her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268"
name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>And when he had entered, he beheld another splendid city, which
seemed like a garden where all the enjoyments of the world had agreed
to meet. In it Sattva&#347;&iacute;la saw that maiden sitting on a
couch studded with gems, and he went up to her, and sat down by her
side. And he remained with his eyes fixed on her face, like a man in a
painting, expressing his passion by his trembling limbs, the hairs on
which stood erect. And when she saw that he was enamoured of her, she
looked at the faces of her attendants, and then they, understanding the
expression of her face, said to him, &ldquo;You have arrived here as a
guest, so enjoy the hospitality provided by our mistress, rise up,
bathe, and then take food.&rdquo; When he heard that, he entertained
some hope, and he rose up, though not without a struggle, and he went
to a tank in the garden which they shewed him. And the moment that he
plunged into it, he rose up, to his astonishment, in the middle of a
tank in the garden of king Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha in
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8733src" href=
"#xd27e8733" name="xd27e8733src">4</a> And seeing himself suddenly
arrived there, he said to himself, &ldquo;Alas! what is the meaning of
this? Now I am in this garden, and a moment ago I was in that splendid
city; I have exchanged in an instant the nectarous vision of that fair
one for the grievous poison of separation from her. But it was not a
dream, for I saw it all clearly in a waking state. It is clear that I
was beguiled like a fool by those maidens of
P&aacute;t&aacute;la.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus reflecting, he wandered about in that garden like a madman,
being deprived of that maiden, and wept in the anguish of disappointed
passion. And the gardeners, when they beheld him in that state, with
body covered with the yellow pollen of flowers wafted by the wind, as
if with the fires of separation, went and told king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and he, being bewildered, came himself and saw
him; and after calming him, he said to him, &ldquo;Tell me, my friend;
what is the meaning of all this? You set out for one place and reached
another, your arrows have not struck the mark at which they were
aimed.&rdquo; When Sattva&#347;&iacute;la heard that, he told the king
all his adventures, and he, when he heard them, said to himself,
&ldquo;Strange to say, though this man is a hero, he has, happily for
me,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8743src" href="#xd27e8743" name=
"xd27e8743src">5</a> been beguiled by love, and I now have it in my
power to discharge my debt of gratitude to him.&rdquo; So the brave
king said to him, &ldquo;Abandon now your needless grief, for I will
conduct you by the same course into the presence of that beloved Asura
maiden.&rdquo; With these words the king comforted him, and refreshed
him with a bath and other restoratives.</p>
<p>The next day the king entrusted the kingdom to his ministers, and
embarking on a ship, set out on the sea with Sattva&#347;&iacute;la,
who shewed him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>the way. And when they had got to that half-way
spot, Sattva&#347;&iacute;la saw the wonderful flagstaff rising out of
the sea with the banner on it, as before, and he said to the king,
&ldquo;Here is that great flagstaff with such wonderful properties,
towering aloft out of the sea: I must plunge in here, and then the king
must plunge in also and dive down after the flagstaff.&rdquo; After
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la had said this, they got near the flagstaff, and
it began to sink. And Sattva&#347;&iacute;la first threw himself in
after it, and then the king also dived in the same direction, and soon
after they had plunged in, they reached that splendid city. And there
the king beheld with astonishment and worshipped that goddess
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, and sat down with Sattva&#347;&iacute;la.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile there issued from that glittering enclosure a
maiden, accompanied by her attendant ladies, looking like the quality
of brightness in concrete form. Sattva&#347;&iacute;la said,
&ldquo;This is that fair one,&rdquo; and the king, beholding her,
considered that his attachment to her was amply justified. She, for her
part, when she beheld that king with all the auspicious bodily marks,
said to herself, &ldquo;Who can this exceedingly distinguished man
be?&rdquo; And so she went into the temple of Durg&aacute; to pray, and
the king contemptuously went off to the garden, taking
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la with him. And in a short time the Daitya maiden
came out from the inner shrine of the goddess, having finished her
devotions, and having prayed that she might obtain a good husband; and
after she had come out, she said to one of her attendants, &ldquo;My
friend, go and see where that distinguished man is whom I saw; and
entreat him to do us the favour of coming and accepting our
hospitality, for he is some great hero deserving special honour.&rdquo;
When the attendant had received this order, she went and looked for
him, and bending low, delivered to him in the garden the message of her
mistress. Then the heroic king answered in a carelessly negligent tone,
&ldquo;This garden is sufficient entertainment for me: what other
entertainment do I require?&rdquo; When that attendant came and
reported this answer to the Daitya maiden, she considered that the king
was a man of a noble spirit and deserving of the highest regard.</p>
<p>And then the Asura maiden, (being, as it were, drawn towards himself
with the cord of his self-command by the king, who shewed a lofty
indifference for hospitality far above mortal desert,) went in person
to the garden, thinking that he had been sent her by way of a husband,
as a fruit of her adoration of Durg&aacute;. And the trees seemed to
honour her, as she approached, with the songs of various birds, with
their creepers bending in the wind like arms, and showers of blossoms.
And she approached the king and bowing courteously before him,
entreated him to accept of her hospitality. Then the king pointed to
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, and said to her, &ldquo;I came here to worship
the image of the goddess of which this man told me. I have reached her
marvellous temple, guided to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>it by the banner, and have seen
the goddess, and after that, you; what other hospitality do I
require?&rdquo; When the maiden heard that, she said, &ldquo;Then come,
out of curiosity, to see my second city, which is the wonder of the
three worlds.&rdquo; When she said this, the king laughed and said,
&ldquo;Oh! he told me of this also, the place where there is the tank
to bathe in.&rdquo; Then the maiden said, &ldquo;King, do not speak
thus, I am not of a deceitful disposition, and who would think of
cheating one so worthy of respect? I have been made the slave of you
both by your surpassing excellence; so you ought not thus to reject my
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this, he consented, and taking
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la with him, he accompanied the maiden to that
glittering enclosure. And the door of it was opened, and she conducted
him in, and then he beheld that other splendid city of hers. The trees
in it were ever producing flowers and fruits, for all seasons were
present there at the same time;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8759src"
href="#xd27e8759" name="xd27e8759src">6</a> and the city was all
composed of gold and jewels like the peak of mount Meru. And the Daitya
maiden made the king sit down on a priceless jewelled throne, and
offered him the <i lang="sa-latn">arghya</i> in due form, and said to
him, &ldquo;I am the daughter of K&aacute;lanemi the high-souled king
of the Asuras, but my father was sent to heaven by Vish&#7751;u, the
discus-armed god. And these two cities, which I inherit from my father,
are the work of Vi&#347;vakarman; they furnish all that heart can wish,
and old age and death never invade them. But now I look upon you as a
father, and I, with my cities, am at your disposal.&rdquo; When she had
in these words placed herself and all that she possessed at the
king&rsquo;s disposal, he said to her, &ldquo;If this be so, then I
give you, excellent daughter, to another, to the hero
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, who is my friend and relation.&rdquo; When the
king, who seemed to be the favour of the goddess Durg&aacute; in bodily
form, said this, the maiden, who understood excellence when she saw it,
acquiesced submissively. When Sattva&#347;&iacute;la had attained the
wish of his heart by marrying that Asura maiden, and had had the
sovereignty of those cities bestowed on him, the king said to him,
&ldquo;Now I have repaid you for one of those <i lang=
"sa-latn">&aacute;malakas</i> which I ate, but I am still indebted to
you for the second, for which I have never recompensed you.&rdquo; When
the king had said this to Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, who bowed before him,
he said to that Daitya maiden, &ldquo;Now shew me the way to my own
city.&rdquo; Then the Daitya maiden gave him a sword named
&ldquo;Invincible,&rdquo; and a fruit to eat, which was a remedy
against old age and death, and with these he plunged into the tank
which she pointed out, and the next thing that happened to him was,
that he rose up in his own land with all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>his wishes gratified.
And Sattva&#347;&iacute;la ruled as king over the cities of the Daitya
princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me: which of those two shewed most courage in
plunging into the water?&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la put this
question to the king, the latter, fearing to be cursed, thus answered
him; &ldquo;I consider Sattva&#347;&iacute;la the braver man of the
two, for he plunged into the sea without knowing the real state of the
case, and without any hope, but the king knew what the circumstances
were when he plunged in, and had something to look forward to, and he
did not fall in love with the Asura princess, because he thought no
longing would win her.&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la received this
answer from the king, who thereby broke silence, he left his shoulder,
as before, and fled to his place on the <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree. And the king, as before, followed him
quickly to bring him back again; for the wise never flag in an
enterprise which they have begun, until it is finished.</p>

<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The Siren&rsquo;s tale&mdash;like many
other episodes of the Iliad and the Odyssey&mdash;reappears in various
forms, one of the most curious of which is perhaps to be found in
Ireland. I borrow it from O&rsquo;Curry; and I omit the depreciatory
criticism with which it is now the fashion to season extracts from that
scholar&rsquo;s useful works. Ruad, son of Rigdonn, a king&rsquo;s son,
crossing over to North-land with three ships and thirty men in each
found his vessel held fast in mid-sea. [Compare the tale of
Vid&uacute;shaka in Vol. I.] At last he leaped over the side to see
what was holding it, and sinking down through the waters, alighted in a
meadow where were nine beautiful women. These gave him nine boatloads
of gold as the price of his embraces, and by their power held the three
vessels immoveable on the water above for nine days. Promising to visit
them on his return, the young Irish prince got away from the Sirens and
their beds of red bronze, and continued his course to Lochlann, where
he stayed with his follow-pupil, son to the king of that country, for
seven years. Coming back, the vessels put about to avoid the submerged
isle, and had nearly gained the Irish shore, when they heard behind
them the song of lamentation of the nine sea-women, who were in vain
pursuit of them in a boat of bronze. One of these murdered before
Ruad&rsquo;s eyes the child she had borne him, and flung it head
foremost after him. O&rsquo;Curry left a version of this tale from the
Book of Ballymote. I have borrowed a detail or two given in the
<i>Tochmarc Emere</i> (fol. 21b)&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, the important
Homeric feature of the watery <i>meadow</i> (machaire). The story given
by Gervase of Tilbury (ed. Liebrecht, pp. 30, 31), of the porpoise-men
in the Mediterranean and the young sailor; the Shetland seal-legend in
Grimm&rsquo;s edition of Croker&rsquo;s tales (<span lang="de">Irische
Elfen-M&auml;rchen</span>, Leipzig, 1826, pp. xlvii <i>et seqq.</i>);
and the story found in Vincentius Bellovacensis and elsewhere, of the
mermaid giantess and her purple cloak, may be named as belonging or
related to the same cycle. These legends are represented in living
Irish traditions and the purple cloak just referred to appears, much
disguised, in the story of Liban in the book of the Dun.&rdquo; Coraes

<h3 class="main">Story of the three fastidious men.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a great tract of land assigned to
Br&aacute;hmans in the country of Anga, called
V&#7771;ikshagha&#7789;a. In it there lived a rich sacrificing
Br&aacute;hman named Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min. And he had a wife equal
to himself in birth. And by her he had three sons born to him, who were
distinguished for preternatural acuteness. In course of time they grew
up to be young men. One day, when he had begun a sacrifice, he sent
those three brothers to the sea to fetch a turtle. So off they went,
and when they had found a turtle, the eldest said to his two
brothers,&mdash;&ldquo;Let one of you take the turtle for our
father&rsquo;s sacrifice, I cannot take it, as it is all slippery with
slime.&rdquo; When the eldest brother said this, the two younger ones
answered him, &ldquo;If you hesitate about taking it, why should not
we?&rdquo; When the eldest heard that, he said, &ldquo;You two must
take the turtle; if you do not, you will have obstructed our
father&rsquo;s sacrifice; and then you and he will certainly sink down
to hell.&rdquo; When he told the younger brothers this, they laughed,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>said to him, &ldquo;If you see our duty so
clearly, why do you not see that your own is the same?&rdquo; Then the
eldest said, &ldquo;What, do you not know how fastidious I am? I am
very fastidious about eating, and I cannot be expected to touch what is
repulsive.&rdquo; The middle brother, when he heard this speech of his,
said to his brother,&mdash;&ldquo;Then I am a more fastidious person
than you, for I am a most fastidious connoisseur of the fair
sex.&rdquo; When the middle one said this, the eldest went on to say,
&ldquo;Then let the younger of you two take the turtle!&rdquo; Then the
youngest brother frowned, and in his turn said to the two elder,
&ldquo;You fools, I am very fastidious about beds, so I am the most
fastidious of the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the three brothers fell to quarrelling with one another, and
being completely under the dominion of conceit, they left that turtle
and went off immediately to the court of the king of that country,
whose name was Prasenajit, and who lived in a city named
Vi&#7789;ankapura, in order to have the dispute decided. There they had
themselves announced by the warder, and went in, and gave the king a
circumstantial account of their case. The king said, &ldquo;Wait here,
and I will put you all in turn to the proof:&rdquo; so they agreed and
remained there. And at the time that the king took his meal, he had
them conducted to a seat of honour, and given delicious food fit for a
king, possessing all the six flavours. And while all were feasting
around him, the Br&aacute;hman, who was fastidious about eating, alone
of all the company did not eat, but sat there with his face puckered up
with disgust. The king himself asked the Br&aacute;hman why he did not
eat his food, though it was sweet and fragrant, and he slowly answered
him, &ldquo;I perceive in this cooked rice an evil smell of the reek
from corpses, so I cannot bring myself to eat it, however delicious it
may be.&rdquo; When he said this before the assembled multitude, they
all smelled it by the king&rsquo;s orders, and said, &ldquo;This food
is prepared from white rice and is good and fragrant.&rdquo; But the
Br&aacute;hman, who was so fastidious about eating, would not touch it,
but stopped his nose. Then the king reflected, and proceeded to enquire
into the matter, and found out from his officers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8806src" href="#xd27e8806" name="xd27e8806src">1</a>, that the
food had been made from rice which had been grown in a field near the
burning-<i lang="sa-latn">gh&aacute;t</i> of a certain village. Then
the king was much astonished, and being pleased, he said to him,
&ldquo;In truth you are very particular as to what you eat; so eat of
some other dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after they had finished their dinner, the king dismissed the
Br&aacute;hmans to their apartments, and sent for the loveliest lady of
his court. And in the evening he sent that fair one, all whose limbs
were of faultless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273"
name="pb273">273</a>]</span>beauty, splendidly adorned, to the second
Br&aacute;hman, who was so squeamish about the fair sex. And that
matchless kindler of Cupid&rsquo;s flame, with a face like the full
moon of midnight, went, escorted by the king&rsquo;s servants, to the
chamber of the Br&aacute;hman. But when she entered, lighting up the
chamber with her brightness, that gentleman, who was so fastidious
about the fair sex, felt quite faint, and stopping his nose with his
left hand, said to the king&rsquo;s servants, &ldquo;Take her away; if
you do not, I am a dead man, a smell comes from her like that of a
goat.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s servants heard this, they took the
bewildered fair one to their sovereign, and told him what had taken
place. And the king immediately had the squeamish gentleman sent for,
and said to him, &ldquo;How can this lovely woman, who has perfumed
herself with sandal-wood, camphor, black aloes, and other splendid
scents, so that she diffuses exquisite fragrance through the whole
world, smell like a goat?&rdquo; But though the king used this argument
with the squeamish gentleman, he stuck to his point; and then the king
began to have his doubts on the subject, and at last by artfully framed
questions he elicited from the lady herself, that, having been
separated in her childhood from her mother and nurse, she had been
brought up on goat&rsquo;s milk.</p>
<p>Then the king was much astonished, and praised highly the
discernment of the man who was fastidious about the fair sex, and
immediately had given to the third Br&aacute;hman who was fastidious
about beds, in accordance with his taste, a bed composed of seven
mattresses placed upon a bedstead. White smooth sheets and coverlets
were laid upon the bed, and the fastidious man slept on it in a
splendid room. But, before half a watch of the night had passed, he
rose up from that bed, with his hand pressed to his side, screaming in
an agony of pain. And the king&rsquo;s officers, who were there, saw a
red crooked mark on his side, as if a hair had been pressed deep into
it. And they went and told the king, and the king said to them,
&ldquo;Look and see if there is not something under the
mattresses.&rdquo; So they went and examined the bottom of the
mattresses one by one, and they found a hair in the middle of the
bedstead underneath them all. And they took it and shewed it to the
king, and they also brought the man who was fastidious about beds, and
when the king saw the state of his body, he was astonished. And he
spent the whole night in wondering how a hair could have made so deep
an impression on his skin through seven mattresses.</p>
<p>And the next morning the king gave three hundred thousand gold
pieces to those three fastidious men, because they were persons of
wonderful discernment and refinement. And they remained in great
comfort in the king&rsquo;s court, forgetting all about the turtle, and
little did they reck of the fact that they had incurred sin by
obstructing their father&rsquo;s sacrifice. <span class=

<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, seated on the shoulder of the king, had told
him this wonderful tale, he again asked him a question in the following
words, &ldquo;King, remember the curse I previously denounced, and tell
me which was the most fastidious of these three, who were respectively
fastidious about eating, the fair sex, and beds?&rdquo; When the wise
king heard this, he gave the Vet&aacute;la the following answer,
&ldquo;I consider the man who was fastidious about beds, in whose case
imposition was out of the question, the most fastidious of the three,
for the mark produced by the hair was seen conspicuously manifest on
his body, whereas the other two may have previously acquired their
information from some one else.&rdquo; When the king said this, the
Vet&aacute;la left his shoulder, as before, and the king again went in
quest of him, as before, without being at all depressed.</p>

<p class="first">The above story resembles No. 2, in the Cento Novelle
Antiche, and one in the Addition to the Arabian tales published by Mr.
Scott. (Dunlop&rsquo;s History of Fiction, Vol. I, p. 415;
Liebrecht&rsquo;s translation, p. 212 and note 282.) See also
Liebrecht, <span lang="de">Zur Volkskunde</span>, p. 203. In the
<span lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</span> a prisoner informs the
king of Greece, that a horse has been suckled by a she-ass, that a
jewel contains a worm, and that the king himself is the son of a
baker.</p>
<p>The incident of the mattress reminds one of the test applied by the
queen to her son&rsquo;s wife in &ldquo;The Palace that stood on Golden
Pillars,&rdquo; (Thorpe&rsquo;s Yuletide Stories, p. 64). In order to
find out whether her daughter-in-law is of high birth, she puts first a
bean, then peas, under her pillow. The prince&rsquo;s wife, who is
really the daughter of a peasant, is apprised of the stratagem by her
cat, which resembles Whittington&rsquo;s. Rohde in his <span lang=
"de">Griechische Novellistik</span>, p. 62, compares a story told by
Aelian about the Sybarite Smindyrides, who slept on a bed of
rose-leaves and got up in the morning covered with blisters. He also
quotes from the Chronicle of Tabari a story of a princess who was made
to bleed by a rose-leaf lying in her bed. Oesterley refers us to
Babington&rsquo;s Vet&aacute;la Cadai, p. 33, and the Chevalier de
Mailly&rsquo;s version of the three Princes of Serendip. The three are
sitting at table, and eating a leg of lamb, sent with some splendid
wine from the table of the Emperor Behram. The eldest maintains that
the wine was made of grapes that grew in a cemetery, the second that
the lamb was brought up on dog&rsquo;s milk, the third says that the
emperor had put to death the <i lang="sa-latn">vazir&rsquo;s</i> son,
and the latter was bent on vengeance. All three statements turn out to
be well-grounded. There are parallel stories in the 1001 Nights
(Breslau). In Night 458 it is similarly conjectured that the bread was
baked by a sick woman, that the kid was suckled by a bitch, and that
the Sultan is illegitimate. In Night 459 a gem-cutter guesses that a
jewel has an internal flaw, a man skilled in the pedigrees of horses
divines that a horse is the offspring of a female buffalo, and a man
skilled in human pedigrees that the mother of the favourite queen was a
rope-dancer. Cp. also the decisions of Hamlet in Saxo Grammaticus,
1839, p. 138, in Simrock&rsquo;s Quellen des Shakespeare, 1,
81&ndash;85; 5, 170; he lays down that some bread tastes of blood, (the
corn was grown on a battle-field), that some liquor tastes of iron,
(the malt was mixed with water taken from a well, in which some rusty
swords had lain<span class="corr" id="xd27e8847" title=
"Source: ,)">),</span> that some bacon tastes of corpses, (the pig had
eaten a corpse), lastly that the king is a servant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>and
his wife a serving-maid. Oesterley refers also to the beginning of
Donatus&rsquo; life of Virgil, and to Heraclius Von Otte, also to the
parallels quoted above from Liebrecht. The brother, who was so
fastidious about beds, may be compared with a princess in
Andersen&rsquo;s Tale of &ldquo;The Princess on a pea,&rdquo;

resembles No. 182 in the older editions of Grimm&rsquo;s <span lang=

Diocletian&rsquo;s test in the Seven Wise Masters. His masters put an

<h3 class="main">Story of Anangarati and her four suitors.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in Avanti a city built by gods at the
beginning of the world, which is limitless as the body of &#346;iva,
and renowned for enjoyment and prosperity, even as his body is adorned
with the snake&rsquo;s hood and ashes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8890src" href="#xd27e8890" name="xd27e8890src">2</a> It was
called Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; in the K&#7771;ita Yuga,
Bhogavat&iacute; in the Tret&aacute; Yuga, Hira&#7751;yavat&iacute; in
the Dv&aacute;para Yuga, and Ujjayin&iacute; in the Kali Yuga. And in
it there lived an excellent king, named V&iacute;radeva, and he had a
queen named Padmarati. The king went with her to the bank of the
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;, and propitiated &#346;iva with austerities, in
order to obtain a son. And after he had remained a long time engaged in
austerities, he performed the ceremonies of bathing and praying, and
then he heard this voice from heaven, uttered by &#346;iva, who was
pleased with him, &ldquo;King, there shall be born to thee a brave son
to be the head of thy family, and a daughter, who with her matchless
beauty shall put to shame the nymphs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>of heaven.&rdquo;
When king V&iacute;radeva had heard this voice from heaven, he returned
to his city with his consort, having gained all he desired.</p>
<p>There he first had a son born to him named &#346;&uacute;radeva, and
after a time queen Padmarati gave birth to a daughter. And her father
gave her the name of Anangarati, on the ground that she was beautiful
enough to inspire love in the breast of Cupid. And, when she grew up,
in his desire to procure for her a suitable husband, he had brought the
portraits of all the kings of the earth, painted on <span class="corr"
id="xd27e8897" title="Source: canvass">canvas</span>. And as no one of
them seemed a match for her, he said to his daughter, in his tenderness
for her; &ldquo;I cannot find a suitable match for you, my daughter, so
summon all the kings of the earth, and select your own husband.&rdquo;
When the princess heard that, she said to her father, &ldquo;My father,
I am too modest to select my own husband, but I must be given in
marriage to a good-looking young man, who is a perfect master of one
art; I do not want any other better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this speech of his daughter Anangarati, he
proceeded to search for a young man, such as she had described, and
while he was thus engaged, there came to him from the Dekkan four
magnificent men, brave and skilful, who had heard from the people what
was going on. Those four suitors for the hand of the princess were
received with respect by the king, and one after another they told to
him in her presence their respective acquirements.</p>
<p>The first said; &ldquo;I am a &#346;&uacute;dra,
Panchaphu&#7789;&#7789;ika by name; I make every day five splendid
pairs of garments: The first of them I give to my god, and the second
to a Br&aacute;hman, the third I retain for my own wearing,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8904src" href="#xd27e8904" name="xd27e8904src">3</a>
the fourth I should give to my wife, if this maid here were to become
my wife, the fifth I sell, and procure myself meat and drink: as I
possess this art, let Anangarati be given to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, the second man said, &ldquo;I am a
Vai&#347;ya, Bh&aacute;sh&aacute;jna by name, I know the speech of all
beasts and birds;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8909src" href="#xd27e8909"
name="xd27e8909src">4</a> so let the princess be given to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the second had said this, the third said, &ldquo;I am a
Kshatriya king, by name Kha&#7693;gadhara, renowned for might of arm:
my equal in the art of swordsmanship does not exist upon the earth, so
bestow this maiden on me, O king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the third had said this, the fourth said, &ldquo;I am a
Br&aacute;hman, named J&iacute;vadatta, and I possess the following
art; I can restore to life dead <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"
href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>creatures, and exhibit them
alive;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8931src" href="#xd27e8931" name=
"xd27e8931src">5</a> so let this maiden obtain for a husband me, who am
renowned for daring exploits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had thus spoken, the king <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8946" title="Source: V&iacute;ravara">V&iacute;radeva</span>,
with his daughter by his side, seeing that they were like gods in shape
and dress, remained lost in doubt.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story, he said to king
Trivikramasena, menacing him with the before-mentioned curse, &ldquo;So
tell me, king, to which of these four ought the maiden Anangarati to be
given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this, he gave the Vet&aacute;la the following
answer; &ldquo;You are thus repeatedly making me break silence simply
in order to waste time; otherwise, master of magic, how could you
possibly ask such an absurd question? How can a woman of Kshatriya
caste be given to a &#346;&uacute;dra weaver? Moreover, how can a
Kshatriya woman be given to a Vai&#347;ya? And as to the power of
understanding the language of beasts and birds, which he possesses,
what is the practical use of it? And as for the third, the
Br&aacute;hman, who fancies himself such a hero, of what worth is he,
as he is a sorcerer, and degraded by abandoning the duties of his
caste? Accordingly the maiden should be given to the fourth suitor, the
Kshatriya Kha&#7693;gadhara, who is of the same caste and distinguished
for his skill and valour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard this, he left the king&rsquo;s
shoulder, as before, and quickly returned by the power of his magic to
his own place, and the king again pursued him, as before, to recover
him, for despondency never penetrates into a hero&rsquo;s heart, that
is cased in armour of fortitude.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Madanasen&aacute; and her rash promise.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an excellent king of the name of
V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu, who imposed his orders on the heads of all
kings: he had a splendid city named Anangapura, and in it there lived a
rich merchant, named Arthadatta; that merchant prince had for elder
child a son named Dhanadatta, and his younger child was a pearl of
maidens, named Madanasen&aacute;.</p>
<p>One day, as she was playing with her companions in her own garden, a
young merchant, named Dharmadatta, a friend of her brother&rsquo;s, saw
her. When he saw that maiden, who with the full streams of her beauty,
her breasts like pitchers half-revealed, and three wrinkles like waves,
resembled a lake for the elephant of youth to plunge in in sport, he
was at once robbed of his senses by the arrows of love, that fell upon
him in showers. He thought to himself, &ldquo;Alas, this maiden,
illuminated with this excessive beauty, has been framed by M&aacute;ra,
as a keen arrow to cleave asunder my heart.&rdquo; While, engaged in
such reflections, he watched her long, the day passed away for him, as
if he were a <i lang="sa-latn">chakrav&aacute;ka</i>. Then
Madanasen&aacute; entered her house, and grief at no longer beholding
her entered the breast of Dharmadatta. And the sun sank red into the
western main, as if inflamed with the fire of grief at seeing her no
more. And the moon, that was surpassed by the lotus of her countenance,
knowing that that fair-faced one had gone in for the night, slowly
mounted upward.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Dharmadatta went home, and thinking upon that fair
one, he remained tossing to and fro on his bed, smitten by the rays of
the moon. And though his friends and relations eagerly questioned him,
he gave them no answer, being bewildered by the demon of love. And in
the course of the night he at length fell asleep, though with
difficulty, and still he seemed to behold and court that loved one in a
dream; to such lengths did his longing carry him. And in the morning he
woke up, and went and saw her once more in that very garden, alone and
in privacy, waiting for her attendant. So he went up to her, longing to
embrace her, and falling at her feet, he tried to coax her with words
tender from affection. But she said to him with great earnestness,
&ldquo;I am a maiden, betrothed to another, I cannot now be yours, for
my father has bestowed me on the merchant Samudradatta, and I am to be
married in a few days. So depart quietly, let not any one see you; it
might cause mischief.&rdquo; But Dharmadatta said to her, &ldquo;Happen
what may, I cannot live without you.&rdquo; When the merchant&rsquo;s
daughter heard this, she was afraid that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>would use force to her, so she said to him,
&ldquo;Let my marriage first be celebrated here, let my father reap the
long-desired fruit of bestowing a daughter in marriage; then I will
certainly visit you, for your love has gained my heart.&rdquo; When he
heard this, he said, &ldquo;I love not a woman that has been embraced
by another man; does the bee delight in a lotus on which another bee
has settled?&rdquo; When he said this to her, she replied, &ldquo;Then
I will visit you as soon as I am married, and afterwards I will go to
my husband.&rdquo; But though she made this promise, he would not let
her go without further assurance, so the merchant&rsquo;s daughter
confirmed the truth of her promise with an oath. Then he let her go,
and she entered her house in low spirits.</p>
<p>And when the lucky day had arrived, and the auspicious ceremony of
marriage had taken place, she went to her husband&rsquo;s house and
spent that day in merriment, and then retired with him. But she
repelled her husband&rsquo;s caresses with indifference, and when he
began to coax her, she burst into tears. He thought to himself,
&ldquo;Of a truth she cares not for me,&rdquo; and said to her,
&ldquo;Fair one, if you do not love me, I do not want you; go to your
darling, whoever he may be.&rdquo; When she heard this, she said
slowly, with downcast face, &ldquo;I love you more than my life, but
hear what I have to say. Rise up cheerfully, and promise me immunity
from punishment; take an oath to that effect, my husband, in order that
I may tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, her husband reluctantly consented, and then she
went on to say with shame, despondency, and fear; &ldquo;A young man of
the name of Dharmadatta, a friend of my brother&rsquo;s, saw me once
alone in our garden, and smitten with love he detained me; and when he
was preparing to use force, I being anxious to secure for my father the
merit of giving a daughter in marriage, and to avoid all scandal, made
this agreement with him; &lsquo;When I am married, I will pay you a
visit, before I go to my husband;&rsquo; so I must now keep my word,
permit me, my husband; I will pay him a visit first, and then return to
you, for I cannot transgress the law of truth which I have observed
from my childhood.&rdquo; When Samudradatta had been thus suddenly
smitten by this speech of hers, as by a down-lighting thunderbolt,
being bound by the necessity of keeping his word, he reflected for a
moment as follows; &ldquo;Alas! she is in love with another man, she
must certainly go; why should I make her break her word? Let her
depart! Why should I be so eager to have her for a wife?&rdquo; After
he had gone through this train of thought, he gave her leave to go
where she would; and she rose up, and left her husband&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the cold-rayed moon ascended the great eastern
mountain, as it were the roof of a palace, and the nymph of the eastern
quarter smiled, touched by his finger. Then, though the darkness was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>still embracing his beloved herbs in the
mountain caves and the bees were settling on another cluster of
<i lang="sa-latn">kumudas</i>, a certain thief saw Madanasen&aacute;,
as she was going along alone at night, and rushing upon her, seized her
by the hem of her garment. He said to her, &ldquo;Who are you, and
where are you going?&rdquo; When he said this, she, being afraid, said,
&ldquo;What does that matter to you? Let me go; I have business
here.&rdquo; Then the thief said, &ldquo;How can I, who am a thief, let
you go?&rdquo; Hearing that, she replied, &ldquo;Take my
ornaments.&rdquo; The thief answered her, &ldquo;What do I care for
those gems, fair one? I will not surrender you, the ornament of the
world, with your face like the moonstone, your hair black like jet,
your waist like a diamond,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9001src" href=
"#xd27e9001" name="xd27e9001src">1</a> your limbs like gold,
fascinating beholders with your ruby-coloured feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the thief said this, the helpless merchant&rsquo;s daughter
told him her story, and entreated him as follows, &ldquo;Excuse me for
a moment, that I may keep my word, and as soon as I have done that, I
will quickly return to you, if you remain here. Believe me, my good
man, I will never break this true promise of mine.&rdquo; When the
thief heard that, he let her go, believing that she was a woman who
would keep her word, and he remained in that very spot, waiting for her
return.</p>
<p>She, for her part, went to that merchant Dharmadatta. And when he
saw that she had come to that wood, he asked her how it happened, and
then, though he had longed for her, he said to her, after reflecting a
moment, &ldquo;I am delighted at your faithfulness to your promise;
what have I to do with you, the wife of another? So go back, as you
came, before any one sees you.&rdquo; When he thus let her go, she
said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and leaving that place, she went to the
thief, who was waiting for her in the road. He said to her, &ldquo;Tell
me what befell you when you arrived at the trysting-place.&rdquo; So
she told him how the merchant let her go. Then the thief said,
&ldquo;Since this is so, then I also will let you go, being pleased
with your truthfulness: return home with your ornaments!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he too let her go, and went with her to guard her, and she
returned to the house of her husband, delighted at having preserved her
honour. There the chaste woman entered secretly, and went delighted to
her husband; and he, when he saw her, questioned her; so she told him
the whole story. And Samudratta, perceiving that his good wife had kept
her word without losing her honour, assumed a bright and cheerful
expression, and welcomed her as a pure-minded woman, who had not
disgraced her family, and lived happily with her ever afterwards.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story in the cemetery to king
Trivikramasena, he went on to say to him; &ldquo;So tell me, king,
which was the really generous man of those three, the two merchants and
the thief?<a id="xd27e9015" name="xd27e9015"></a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>And
if you know and do not tell, your head shall split into a hundred
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la said this, the king broke silence, and said
to him, &ldquo;Of those three the thief was the only really generous
man, and not either of the two merchants. For of course her husband let
her go, though she was so lovely and he had married her; how could a
gentleman desire to keep a wife that was attached to another? And the
other resigned her because his passion was dulled by time, and he was
afraid that her husband, knowing the facts, would tell the king the
next day. But the thief, a reckless evildoer, working in the dark, was
really generous, to let go a lovely woman, ornaments and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard that, he left the shoulder of the king,
and returned to his own place, as before, and the king, with his great
perseverance no whit dashed, again set out, as before, to bring
him.</p>

West Highland Tales, The Inheritance, Vol. II, pp. 16&ndash;18. Dr.

<h3 class="main">Story of king Dharmadhvaja and his three very
sensitive wives.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived of old in Ujjayin&iacute; a king of the
name of Dharmadhvaja, he had three wives, who were all daughters of
kings, and whom he held very dear. The first of them was called
Indulekh&aacute;, the second T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute;, and the
third M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;; and they were all possessed of
extraordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>personal charms. And the successful king, who
had conquered all his enemies, lived happily, amusing himself with all
those three queens.</p>
<p>Once on a time, when the festival of the spring-season had arrived,
he went with all those three wives to the garden to amuse himself.
There he beheld the creepers weighed down with flowers, looking like
Cupid&rsquo;s bows, with rows of bees for strings, strung for him by
the Spring. And the king, who resembled the mighty Indra, hearing the
notes which the cuckoos uttered on the sprays of the garden-trees, like
the edict of Love, the god of enjoyment, betook himself with his wives
to wine, which is the very life of that intoxication, by which Cupid
lives. And he joyed in drinking the liquor first tasted by them,
perfumed with their sighs, red as their <i lang="sa-latn">bimba</i>
lips.</p>
<p>Then, as Indulekh&aacute; was playfully pulling the hair of the
king, a blue lotus leaped from her ear, and fell on her lap.
Immediately a wound was produced on the front of her thigh by the blow,
and the delicate princess exclaimed &ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; and fainted.
When the king and the attendants saw that, they were distracted with
grief, but they gradually brought her round with cold water and
fanning. Then the king took her to the palace, and had a bandage
applied to the wound, and treated her with preparations made by the
physicians.</p>
<p>And at night, seeing that she was going on well, the king retired
with the second, T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute;, to an apartment on the
roof of the palace exposed to the rays of the moon. There the rays of
the moon, entering through the lattice, fell on the body of the queen,
who was sleeping by the king&rsquo;s side, where it was exposed by her
garment blowing aside. Immediately she woke up, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Alas! I am burnt,&rdquo; and rose up from the bed rubbing her
limbs. The king woke up in a state of alarm, crying out, &ldquo;What is
the meaning of this?&rdquo; Then he got up and saw that blisters had
been produced on the queen&rsquo;s body. And the queen
T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; said to him when he questioned her,
&ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s rays falling on my exposed body have done this
to me.&rdquo; When she said this and burst into tears, the king, being
distressed, summoned her attendants, who ran there in trepidation and
alarm. And he had made for her a bed of lotus-leaves, sprinkled with
water, and sandal-wood lotion applied to her body.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile his third wife M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;
heard of it, and left her palace to come to him. And when she had got
into the open air, she heard distinctly, as the night was still, the
sound of a pestle pounding rice in a distant house. The moment the
gazelle-eyed one heard it, she said, &ldquo;Alas I am killed,&rdquo;
and she sat down on the path, shaking her hands in an agony of pain.
Then the girl turned back, and was conducted by her attendants to her
own chamber, where she fell on the bed, and groaned. And when her
weeping attendants examined her, they saw that her hands <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>were
covered with bruises, and looked like lotuses upon which black bees had
settled. So they went and told the king. The king Dharmadhvaja arrived
in a state of consternation, and asked his beloved what it all meant.
Then the tortured queen showed him her hands, and said to him,
&ldquo;As soon as I heard the sound of the pestle, these became covered
with bruises.&rdquo; Then the king, filled with surprise and
despondency, had sandal-wood unguent and other remedies applied to her
hands, in order to allay the pain.</p>
<p>He reflected, &ldquo;One of my queens has been wounded by the fall
of a lotus, the second has had her body burned even by the rays of the
moon, and alas! the third has got such terrible bruises produced on her
hands by the mere sound of a pestle. By a dispensation of fate the
excessive delicacy, which is the distinguishing excellence of my
queens, has now become in them all, at one and the same time, a
defect.&rdquo; Engaged in such reflections the king wandered round the
women&rsquo;s apartments, and the night of three watches passed for him
as tediously as if it had consisted of a hundred watches. But the next
morning, the physician and surgeons took measures, which caused him
soon to be comforted by the recovery of his wives.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this very wonderful story, he put
this question to king Trivikramasena from his seat on his shoulder:
&ldquo;Tell me, king, which was the most delicate of those queens; and
the curse I before mentioned will take effect, if you know and do not
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard that, he answered, &ldquo;The most delicate of
all was the lady upon whose hand bruises were produced by merely
hearing the sound of the pestle, without touching it. But the other two
were no match for her, because the wound of the one and the blisters of
the other were produced by contact with the lotus and the rays of the
moon respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, the Vet&aacute;la again left his
shoulder, and returned to his own place, and the persevering king again
set out to fetch him.</p>

<p class="first">Rohde in his Griechische Novellistik, p. 62, compares
with this a story told by Tim&aelig;us of a Sybarite, who saw a
husbandman hoeing a field, and contracted a rupture from it. Another
Sybarite, to whom he told his piteous tale, got ear-ache from hearing
it. Oesterley in his German translation of the Bait&aacute;l
Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, p. 199, refers us to Lancereau, No. 5, pp.
396&ndash;399, and Babington&rsquo;s Vet&aacute;la Cadai, No. 11, p.
58. He points out that Grimm, in his <span lang=
"de">Kinderm&auml;rchen</span>, 3, p. 238, quotes a similar incident
from the travels of the three sons of Giaffar. Out of four princesses,
one faints because a rose-twig is thrown into her face among some
roses, a second shuts her eyes in order not to see the statue of a man,
a third says &ldquo;Go away, the hairs in your fur-cloak run
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>into me,&rdquo; and the fourth covers her face,
fearing that some of the fish in a tank may belong to the male sex. He
also quotes a striking parallel from the <span lang="fr">&Eacute;lite
des contes du Sieur d&rsquo;Ouville</span>. Four ladies dispute as to
which of them is the most delicate. One has been lame for three months
owing to a rose-leaf having fallen on her foot, another has had three
ribs broken by a sheet in her bed having been crumpled, a third has
held her head on one side for six weeks owing to one half of her head
having three or four more hairs on it than the other, a fourth has
broken a blood-vessel by a slight movement, and the rupture cannot be
healed without breaking the whole limb.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, his
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; wife, and his faithful minister.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the land of Anga there was a young king named
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, like a second and unburnt god of love come to
earth to conceal his body.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9104src" href=
"#xd27e9104" name="xd27e9104src">1</a> He conquered by his great valour
all his enemies; and as Indra has V&#7771;ihaspati for a minister, he
had D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in. Now, in course of time, this king,
infatuated with his youth and beauty, entrusted to that minister his
realm, from which all enemies had been eradicated, and became devoted
to pleasure only. He remained continually in the harem instead of the
judgment-hall; he listened to delightful songs in the womens&rsquo;
apartments, instead of hearkening to the voice of his well-wishers; in
his thoughtlessness, he was devoted to latticed windows and not to the
affairs of his kingdom, though the latter also were full of holes.</p>
<p>But the great minister D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in continued
unweariedly upholding the burden of his kingdom&rsquo;s cares, day and
night. And a general rumour spread to the following effect,
&ldquo;D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in has plunged in dissipation the
sovereign, who is satisfied with the mere name of king, and so he
manages now to enjoy himself all his master&rsquo;s power.&rdquo; Then
the minister D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in said of himself to his wife
Medh&aacute;vat&iacute;, &ldquo;My dear, as the king <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>is
addicted to pleasure, and I do his work, a calumny has been circulated
among the people against me, to the effect that I have devoured the
realm. And a general rumour, though false, injures even great men in
this world; was not R&aacute;ma compelled by a slanderous report to
abandon his wife S&iacute;t&aacute;? So what course must I adopt in
this emergency?&rdquo; When the minister said this, his firm-souled
wife Medh&aacute;vat&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9111src" href=
"#xd27e9111" name="xd27e9111src">2</a> who was rightly named, said to
him; &ldquo;Take leave of the king on the pretext of a pilgrimage to
holy bathing-places; it is expedient, great-minded Sir, that you should
go to a foreign land for a certain time. So you will be seen to be free
from ambition, and the calumny against you will die out; and while you
are absent, the king will bear the burden of the kingdom himself, and
then this vicious tendency of his will gradually diminish, and when you
return, you will be able to discharge your office of minister without
blame.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in&rsquo;s wife said this to him, he
said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and he went and said to the king
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu in the course of conversation, &ldquo;Give me
leave to depart, king, I am going on a pilgrimage for some days, for my
heart is set on that religious duty.&rdquo; When the king heard that,
he said, &ldquo;Do not do so! Cannot you, without going on pilgrimages,
perform in your house noble religious duties, such as charity and so
on, which will procure you heaven?&rdquo; When the minister heard this,
he said, &ldquo;King, that purity which comes of wealth is sought by
charity and so on, but holy bathing-places have an everlasting purity.
And a wise man must visit them, while he is young; for otherwise how
can he be sure of reaching them, as this body cannot be relied
on?&rdquo; While he was saying this, and the king was still trying to
dissuade him, a warder entered, and said to the king, &ldquo;King, the
sun is plunging into the middle of the lake of heaven, so rise up, this
is the hour appointed for you to bathe in, and it is rapidly passing
away.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he immediately rose up to bathe,
and the minister, whose heart was set on pilgrimage, bowed before him,
and went home to his own house.</p>
<p>There he left his wife, whom he forbade to follow him, and managed
cunningly to set out in secret, without even his servants suspecting
his departure. And alone he wandered from country to country with
resolute perseverance, and visited holy bathing-places, and at last he
reached the land of Pau&#7751;&#7693;ra. In a certain city in that
country not far from the sea, he entered a temple of &#346;iva, and sat
down in a courtyard attached to it. There a merchant, named Nidhidatta,
who had come to worship the god, saw him exhausted with the heat of the
sun&rsquo;s rays, dusty with his long journey. The merchant, being a
hospitable man, seeing that the traveller, who was in such a state,
wore a Br&aacute;hmanical thread, and had auspicious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>marks, concluded that he was a distinguished
Br&aacute;hman, and took him home to his own house. There he honoured
him with a bath, food, and other refreshments in the most luxurious
style, and when his fatigue was removed, he said to him, &ldquo;Who are
you, whence do you come, and where are you going?&rdquo; And the
Br&aacute;hman gave him this reserved answer; &ldquo;I am a
Br&aacute;hman of the name of D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in; I have come
here on pilgrimage from the land of Anga.&rdquo; Then the merchant
prince Nidhidatta said to him, &ldquo;I am about to go on a trading
expedition to the Island of Gold; so you must live in my house, until I
return; and then you will have recovered from the fatigue which you
have incurred by roaming to holy places, and you can go home.&rdquo;
When D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in heard that, he said, &ldquo;Why should I
remain here? I will go with you, great merchant, if you like.&rdquo;
The good man said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and then the minister, who
had long discarded the use of beds, spent that night in his house.</p>
<p>The next day he went with that merchant to the sea, and embarked on
a ship laden with his merchandise. He travelled along in that ship, and
beheld the awful and wonderful ocean, and in course of time reached the
Isle of Gold. What had a man holding the office of prime minister to do
with sea-voyages? But what will not men of honour do to prevent their
fame from being sullied? So he remained some time in that island with
that merchant Nidhidatta, who was engaged in buying and selling.</p>
<p>And as he was returning with him on the ship, he suddenly saw a wave
rise up, and then a wishing-tree arise out of the sea; it was adorned
with boughs glittering with gold, which were embellished with sprays of
coral, and bore lovely fruits and flowers of jewels. And he beheld on
its trunk a maiden, alluring on account of her wonderful beauty,
reclining on a gem-bestudded couch. He reflected for a moment,
&ldquo;Dear me! What can this be?&rdquo; And thereupon the maiden, who
had a lyre in her hand, began to sing this song, &ldquo;Whatever seed
of works any man has sown in a former life, of that he, without doubt,
eats the fruit; for even fate cannot alter what has been done in a
previous state of existence.&rdquo; When the heavenly maiden had sung
this song, she immediately plunged into that sea, with the
wishing-tree, and the couch on which she was reclining. Then
D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in reflected, &ldquo;I have to-day seen a
wonderful sight; one would never have expected to find in the sea a
tree, with a heavenly maiden singing on it, appearing and disappearing
as soon as beheld. Or rather, this admirable treasure-house of the sea
is ever the same; did not Lakshm&iacute;, and the moon, and the
P&aacute;rij&aacute;ta tree, and other precious things come out of
it?&rdquo; But the steersman and the rest of the crew, perceiving that
D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in was astonished and puzzled, said to him,
&ldquo;This lovely woman always appears here in the same way, and sinks
down again at once; but this sight is new to you.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is what they said to the minister, but he still continued in a
state of wonder, and so he reached in course of time on the ship, with
that Nidhidatta, the coast for which they were making. There the
merchant disembarked his wares, gladdening the hearts of his servants,
and the minister went in high spirits with him to his house, which was
full of mirth at his arrival. And after he had remained there a short
time, he said to Nidhidatta, &ldquo;Merchant prince, I have long
reposed comfortably in your house, now I wish to return to my own land;
I wish you all happiness.&rdquo; With these words he took leave of the
merchant prince, who was sorely unwilling to let him go, and with his
virtue for his only companion he set out thence, and having in course
of time accomplished the long journey, he reached his own native land
of Anga.</p>
<p>There the spies, who had been placed by king Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu to
watch for his return, saw him coming, before he entered the city, and
informed the king; and then the king, who had been much afflicted by
his absence, went out from the city to meet him; and came up to him and
welcomed him with an embrace. Then the king conducted into the palace
his minister, who was emaciated and begrimed with his long journey, and
said to him, &ldquo;Why did you leave me, bringing your mind to this
cruel heartless step, and your body into this squalid state from its
being deprived of unguents?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9134src" href=
"#xd27e9134" name="xd27e9134src">3</a> But who knows the way of the
mighty god Fate, in that you suddenly fixed your mind on pilgrimage to
holy waters and other sacred places? So tell me, what lands have you
wandered through, and what novel sights have you seen?&rdquo; Then
D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in described his journey to the Island of Gold,
in all its stages, and so was led to tell the king of that maiden, the
jewel of the three worlds, whom he had seen rise out of the sea, and
sit on the wishing-tree singing. All this he narrated exactly as it
took place.</p>
<p>The moment the king heard all this, he fell so deeply in love with
her, that he considered his kingdom and life valueless without her. And
taking his minister aside, he said to him, &ldquo;I must certainly see
that maiden, otherwise I cannot live. I will go by the way which you
have described, after worshipping Fate. And you must not dissuade, and
you must by no means follow me, for I will travel alone
<i>incognito</i>, and in the meanwhile you must take care of my
kingdom. Do not disobey my order, otherwise my death will lie at your
door.&rdquo; Thus spake the king, and refused to hear his
minister&rsquo;s answer, and then dismissed him to his own house to see
his relations, who had long been wishing for his return. There, in the
midst of great rejoicing D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in remained despondent;
how can good ministers be happy, when their lord&rsquo;s vices are
incurable?</p>
<p>And the next night the king Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu set out, disguised
as an ascetic, having entrusted his kingdom to the care of that
minister. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>on the way, as he was going along, he saw a
hermit, named Ku&#347;an&aacute;bha, and he bowed before him. The
hermit said to the king who was disguised as an ascetic, &ldquo;Go on
your way boldly; by going to sea in a ship with the merchant
Lakshm&iacute;datta you shall obtain that maiden whom you
desire.&rdquo; This speech delighted the king exceedingly, and bowing
again before the hermit, he continued his journey; and after crossing
many countries, rivers, and mountains, he reached the sea, which seemed
to be full of eagerness to entertain him. Its eddies looked like eyes
expanded to gaze at him, eyes of which waves were the curved brows, and
which were white with shrill-sounding conchs for pupils. On the shore
he met the merchant Lakshm&iacute;datta spoken of by the hermit, who
was on the point of setting out for the Isle of Gold. The merchant
prostrated himself before him, when he saw the signs of his royal
birth, such as the discus-marked foot-print and so on; and the king
embarked on the ship with him, and set out with him on the sea. And
when the ship had reached the middle of the ocean, that maiden arose
from the water, seated on the trunk of the wishing-tree, and while the
king was gazing at her, as a partridge at the moonlight, she sang a
song which the accompaniment of her lyre made more charming;
&ldquo;Whatever seed of works any man has sown in a former life, of
that he, without doubt, eats the fruit, for even Fate cannot alter what
has been done in a previous state of existence. So a man is helplessly
borne along to experience precisely that lot which Fate has appointed
for him, in that place and in that manner which Fate has decreed; of
this there can be no doubt.&rdquo; When the king heard her singing this
song, and thus setting forth the thing that must be, he was smitten
with the arrow of love, and remained for some time motionless, gazing
at her. Then he began, with bowed head, to praise the sea in the
following words, &ldquo;Hail, to thee, store-house of jewels, of
unfathomable heart, since by concealing this lovely nymph thou hast
cheated Vish&#7751;u out of Lakshm&iacute;. So I throw myself on thy
protection, thou who canst not be sounded even by gods, the refuge of
mountains<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9146src" href="#xd27e9146" name=
"xd27e9146src">4</a> that retain their wings; grant me to obtain my
desire.&rdquo; While he was uttering this, the maiden disappeared in
the sea, with the tree, and when the king saw that, he flung himself
into the sea after her, as if to cool the flames of love&rsquo;s
fire.</p>
<p>When the merchant Lakshm&iacute;datta saw that unexpected sight, the
good man thought the king had perished, and was so afflicted that he
was on the point of committing suicide, but he was consoled by the
following utterance, that came from the heavens, &ldquo;Do not act
rashly; he is not in danger, though he has plunged into the sea; this
king, Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu by name, has come, disguised as an ascetic,
to obtain this very maiden, for she was his wife in a former state of
existence, and as soon as he has won <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>her, he shall return
to his realm of Anga.&rdquo; Then the merchant continued his intended
voyage, to accomplish his purposes.</p>
<p>But when king Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu plunged into the sea, he suddenly
beheld to his astonishment a splendid city. It gleamed with palaces
that had bright pillars of precious stone, walls flashing with gold,
and latticed windows of pearl. It was adorned with gardens in which
were tanks with flights of steps composed of slabs of every kind of
gem, and wishing-trees that granted every desire. He entered house
after house in that city, which, though opulent, was uninhabited, but
he could not find his beloved anywhere. Then, as he was looking about,
he beheld a lofty jewelled palace, and going up to it he opened the
door and went in. And when he had entered it, he beheld a solitary
human form stretched out upon a gem-bestudded couch, with its whole
length covered with a shawl. Wondering whether it could be that very
lady, he uncovered its face with eager expectation, and saw his
lady-love. Her beautiful moon-like countenance smiled, when the black
robe fell from it like darkness; and she seemed like a night, illumined
with moonlight, gone to visit P&aacute;t&aacute;la in the day. At sight
of her the king was in a state of ecstasy, like that which a man,
travelling through a desert in the season of heat, experiences on
beholding a river. She, for her part, opened her eyes, and when she saw
that hero of auspicious form and bodily marks thus suddenly arrived,
sprang from her couch in a state of excitement. She welcomed him, and
with downcast countenance, seemed to honour him by flinging on his feet
the full-blown lotuses of her wide-expanded eyes; and then she slowly
said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, and why have you come to this
inaccessible lower region? And why, though your body is marked with the
signs of royalty, have you undertaken the vow of an ascetic? Condescend
to tell me this, distinguished Sir, if I have found favour in your
sight.&rdquo; When the king had heard this speech of hers, he gave her
this answer; &ldquo;Fair one, I am the king of Anga, by name
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, and I heard from a friend on whom I can rely,
that you were to be seen here every day in the sea. So I assumed this
disguise, and abandoned my kingdom for your sake, and I have come here
and followed you down through the sea. So tell me who you are.&rdquo;
When he said this, she answered him with mixed feelings of shame,
affection, and joy; &ldquo;There is a fortunate king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas named M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkasena; know that I am his
daughter, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; by name. That father of
mine, for some reason unknown to me, has left me alone in this city of
his, and has gone somewhere or other with his subjects. So I, feeling
melancholy in my solitary abode, rise up out of the sea on a
moveable<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9156src" href="#xd27e9156" name=
"xd27e9156src">5</a> wishing-tree, and sing of the decrees of
Fate.&rdquo; When she had said this, the brave king, remembering the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>speech of the hermit, courted her so assiduously
with speeches tender with love, that she was overpowered with
affection, and promised to become his wife at once, but insisted on the
following condition; &ldquo;My husband, for four days in every month,
the fourteenth and eighth of the white and black fortnights, I am not
my own mistress;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9167src" href="#xd27e9167"
name="xd27e9167src">6</a> and whithersoever I may go on those days, you
must not question me on the subject nor forbid me, for there is a
reason for it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9173src" href=
"#xd27e9173" name="xd27e9173src">7</a> When the heavenly maiden had
stated in these words the only condition on which she would consent to
marry the king, he agreed to it, and married her by the
G&aacute;ndharva form of marriage.</p>
<p>And one day, while the king was living happily with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, she said to him, &ldquo;You must stop
here, while I go somewhere for a certain business, for to-day is the
fourteenth day of the black fortnight of which I spoke to you. And
while you are waiting here, my husband, you must not enter this crystal
pavilion, lest you should fall into a lake there and go to the world of
men.&rdquo; When she had said this, she took leave of him, and went out
of that city, and the king took his sword and followed her secretly,
determined to penetrate the mystery.</p>
<p>Then the king saw a terrible R&aacute;kshasa approaching, looking
like Hades embodied in a human shape, with his cavernous mouth, black
as night, opened wide. That R&aacute;kshasa uttered an appalling roar,
and swooping down on M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, put her in his
mouth and swallowed her. When the mighty king saw that, he was at once,
so to speak, on fire with excessive anger, and rushing forward with his
great sword, black as a snake that has cast its slough,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9180src" href="#xd27e9180" name="xd27e9180src">8</a>
drawn from the sheath, he cut off with it the head of the charging
R&aacute;kshasa, the lips of which were firmly pressed together. Then
the burning fire of the king&rsquo;s anger was quenched by the stream
of blood that poured forth from the trunk of the R&aacute;kshasa, but
not the fire of his grief at the loss of his beloved. Then the king was
blinded with the darkness of bewilderment, and at a loss what to do,
when suddenly M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; cleft asunder the body
of that R&aacute;kshasa, which was dark as a cloud, and emerged alive
and uninjured, illuminating all the horizon like a spotless moon. When
the king saw his beloved thus delivered from danger, he rushed eagerly
forward and embraced her, exclaiming, &ldquo;Come! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>Come!&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;My
beloved, what does all this mean? Is it a dream or a delusion?&rdquo;
When the king asked the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; this question, she
remembered the truth, and said: &ldquo;Listen, my husband! This is no
delusion, nor is it a dream; but such was the curse imposed upon me by
my father, a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. For my father, who
formerly lived in this city, though he had many sons, was so fond of
me, that he would never take food when I was not present. But I, being
devoted to the worship of &#346;iva, used always to come to this
uninhabited place on the fourteenth and eighth days of the two
fortnights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one fourteenth day I came here and worshipped
Gaur&iacute; for a long time; and, as fate would have it, so ardent was
my devotion that the day came to an end before my worship was finished.
That day my father ate nothing and drank nothing, though he was hungry
and thirsty, as he waited for me, but he was very angry with me. And
when I returned in the evening with downcast countenance, conscious of
my fault, his love for me was so completely overpowered by the force of
Destiny, that he cursed me in the following words; &lsquo;As owing to
your arrogance I was devoured to-day by hunger, so on the eighth and
fourteenth days of the two fortnights of every month, and on those days
only, a R&aacute;kshasa named K&#7771;it&aacute;ntasantr&aacute;sa
shall swallow you, when you go to that place outside the city to
worship &#346;iva; and on every occasion you shall make your way
through his heart and come out alive. But you shall not remember the
curse, nor the pain of being swallowed; and you shall remain alone
here.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9193src" href="#xd27e9193"
name="xd27e9193src">9</a> When my father had uttered this curse, I
managed gradually to propitiate him, and after thinking a little he
appointed this termination to my curse; &lsquo;When a king named
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, lord of the land of Anga, shall become your
husband, and shall see you swallowed by the R&aacute;kshasa, and shall
slay him, then you shall issue from his heart, and shall be delivered
from your curse, and you shall call to mind your curse and the other
circumstances, and all your supernatural sciences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had appointed this end of my curse, he left me alone
here, and went with his retinue to the mountain of Nishada in the world
of men. And I remained here, thus engaged, bewildered by the curse. But
that curse has now come to an end, and I remember all. So I will
immediately go to my father on the <span class="corr" id="xd27e9198"
title="Source: Nishadha">Nishada</span> mountain; the law, that governs
us celestial beings, is, that when our curse is at an end we return to
our own place. You are perfectly free to remain here or go to your
kingdom, as you like.&rdquo; When she had said this, the king was
sorry, and he made this request to her; &ldquo;Fair one, do me the
favour not to go for seven days. Let us in the meanwhile <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>cheat the pain of parting by amusing ourselves
here in the garden. After that you shall go to your father&rsquo;s
abode, and I will return to mine.&rdquo; When he made this proposal,
the fair one agreed to it. Then the king diverted himself with her for
six days in the gardens, and in tanks, the lotus-eyes of which were
full of tears, and that seemed to toss aloft their waves like hands,
and in the cries of their swans and cranes to utter this plaintive
appeal, &ldquo;Do not leave us!&rdquo; And on the seventh day he
artfully decoyed his darling to that pavilion, where was the tank that
served as a magic gate<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9203src" href=
"#xd27e9203" name="xd27e9203src">10</a> conducting to the world of men;
and throwing his arms round her neck, he plunged into that tank, and
rose up with her from a tank in the garden of his own city. When the
gardeners saw that he had arrived with his beloved, they were
delighted, and they went and told his minister
D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in. And the minister came and fell at his feet,
and seeing that he had brought with him the lady of his aspirations, he
and the citizens escorted him into the palace. And he thought to
himself, &ldquo;Dear me! I wonder how the king has managed to obtain
this celestial nymph, of whom I caught a transient glimpse in the
ocean, as one sees in the heaven a lightning-flash. But the fact is,
whatever lot is written for a man by the Disposer in the inscription on
his forehead, infallibly befalls him, however improbable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the reflections of the prime minister; while the rest of
his subjects were full of joy at the return of the king, and of
astonishment at his having won the celestial nymph. But
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, seeing that the king had returned to
his own kingdom, longed, as the seven days were completed, to return to
the home of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. But the science of flying up into
the air did not appear to her, though she called it to mind. Then she
felt as one robbed of a treasure, and was in the deepest despondency.
And the king said to her, &ldquo;Why do you suddenly appear despondent,
tell me, my darling?&rdquo; Then the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; answered
him, &ldquo;Because I remained so long, after I had been released from
my curse, out of love for you, my science has abandoned me, and I have
lost the power of returning to my heavenly home.&rdquo; When king
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu heard this, he said, &ldquo;Ha! I have now won
this Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;,&rdquo; and so his rejoicing was
complete.</p>
<p>When the minister D&iacute;rghadar&#347;in saw this, he went home,
and at night, when he was in bed, he suddenly died of a broken heart.
And Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, after he had mourned for him, remained long
bearing the burden of empire himself, with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; for his consort.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, seated on the shoulder of king
Trivikramasena, had told him this story on the way, he went on to say
to him, &ldquo;So tell me, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>king; why did the heart of that
great minister suddenly break, when his master had thus succeeded so
completely? Did his heart break through grief at not having won the
nymph himself? Or was it because he longed for the sovereign power, and
thus was disappointed at the king&rsquo;s return? And if you know this,
king, and do not tell me on the spot, your merit will at once
disappear, and your head will fly in pieces.&rdquo; When king
Trivikramasena heard that, he said to the Vet&aacute;la; &ldquo;Neither
of these two feelings actuated that excellent and virtuous minister.
But he said to himself; &lsquo;This king neglected his kingdom out of
devotion to mere human females, much more will he do so now, that he is
attached to a heavenly nymph. So, though I have gone through much
suffering, the disease has been aggravated by it, instead of being
cured, as I had hoped.&rsquo; It was under the influence of such
reflections that the minister&rsquo;s heart broke.&rdquo; When the king
had said this, that juggling Vet&aacute;la returned to his own place,
and the resolute king ran swiftly after him, to bring him back again by
force.</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of Harisv&aacute;min, who first lost his
wife, and then his life.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city of the name of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9241" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
the abode of &#346;iva. In it there lived a Br&aacute;hman, named
Devasv&aacute;min, honoured by the king. And that rich Br&aacute;hman
had a son named Harisv&aacute;min; and he had an exceedingly lovely
wife, named L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute;. I think the Disposer must
have made her after he had acquired skill by making Tilottam&aacute;
and the other nymphs of heaven, for she was of priceless beauty and
loveliness.</p>
<p>Now, one night Harisv&aacute;min fell asleep, as he was reposing
with her in a palace cool with the rays of the moon. At that very
moment a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, by name Madanavega,
roaming about at will, came that way through the air. He saw that
L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute; sleeping by the side of her husband,
and her robe, that had slipped aside, revealed her exquisitely moulded
limbs. His heart was captivated by her beauty; and blinded by love, he
immediately swooped down, and taking her up in his arms asleep, flew
off with her through the air.</p>
<p>Immediately her husband, the young man Harisv&aacute;min, woke up,
and not seeing his beloved, he rose up in a state of distraction. He
said to himself, &ldquo;What can this mean? Where has she gone? I
wonder if she is angry with me. Or has she hidden herself to find out
my real feelings, and is making fun of me?&rdquo; Distracted by many
surmises of this kind, he wandered hither and thither that night,
looking for her on the roof, and in the turrets of the palace. He even
searched in the palace-garden, and when he could not find her anywhere,
being scorched with the fire of grief, he sobbed and lamented,
&ldquo;Alas! my beloved with face like the moon&rsquo;s orb, fair as
the moonlight; did this night grudge your existence, hating your charms
that rival hers<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9250src" href="#xd27e9250"
name="xd27e9250src">2</a>? That very moon, that, vanquished by your
beauty, seemed to be in fear, and comforted me with its rays cool as
sandalwood, now that I am bereaved of you, seems to have seen its
opportunity, and smites me with them, as if with burning coals, or
arrows dipped in poison.&rdquo; While Harisv&aacute;min was uttering
these laments, the night at last slowly passed away, not so his grief
at his bereavement.</p>
<p>The next morning the sun dispelled with his rays the deep darkness
that covered the world, but could not dispel the dense darkness of
despondency that had settled on him. The sound of his bitter
lamentations, that seemed to have been reinforced by wailing power
bestowed on him by the <i lang="sa-latn">chakrav&aacute;kas</i>, whose
period of separation was at an end with the night, was magnified a
hundredfold. The young Br&aacute;hman, though his relations tried to
comfort him, could not recover his self-command, now that he was
bereaved of his beloved, but was all inflamed with the fire of
separation. And he went from place to place, exclaiming with tears,
&ldquo;Here she stood, here she bathed, here she adorned herself, and
here she amused herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his friends and relations said to him, &ldquo;She is not dead,
so why do you kill yourself? If you remain alive, you will certainly
recover her somewhere or other. So adopt a resolute tone, and go in
search of your beloved; there is nothing in this world that a resolute
man, who exerts himself, cannot obtain.&rdquo; When Harisv&aacute;min
had been exhorted in these terms by his friends and relations, he
managed at last, after some days, to recover his spirits by the aid of
hope. And he said to himself, &ldquo;I will give away all that I have
to the Br&aacute;hmans, and visit all the holy waters, and wash away
all my sins. For if I wipe out my sin, I may perhaps, in the course
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>of my wanderings, find that beloved of
mine.&rdquo; After going through these reflections suitable to the
occasion, he got up and bathed, and performed all his customary
avocations, and the next day he bestowed on the Br&aacute;hmans at a
solemn sacrifice various meats and drinks, and gave away to them all
his wealth without stint.</p>
<p>Then he left his country, with his Br&aacute;hman birth as his only
fortune, and proceeded to go round to all the holy bathing-places in
order to recover his beloved. And as he was roaming about, there came
upon him the terrible lion of the hot season, with the blazing sun for
mouth, and with a mane composed of his fiery rays. And the winds blew
with excessive heat, as if warmed by the breath of sighs furnaced forth
by travellers grieved at being separated from their wives. And the
tanks, with their supply of water diminished by the heat, and their
drying white mud, appeared to be shewing their broken hearts. And the
trees by the roadside seemed to lament<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9269src" href="#xd27e9269" name="xd27e9269src">3</a> on account
of the departure of the glory of spring, making their wailing heard in
the shrill moaning of their bark,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9278src"
href="#xd27e9278" name="xd27e9278src">4</a> with leaves, as it were
lips, parched with heat. At that season Harisv&aacute;min, wearied out
with the heat of the sun, with bereavement, hunger and thirst, and
continual travelling, disfigured,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9287src"
href="#xd27e9287" name="xd27e9287src">5</a> emaciated and dirty, and
pining for food, reached in the course of his wanderings, a certain
village, and found in it the house of a Br&aacute;hman called
Padman&aacute;bha, who was engaged in a sacrifice. And seeing that many
Br&aacute;hmans were eating in his house, he stood leaning against the
door-post, silent and motionless. And the good wife of that
Br&aacute;hman named Padman&aacute;bha, seeing him in this position,
felt pity for him, and reflected; &ldquo;Alas! mighty is hunger! Whom
will it not bring down? For here stands a man at the door, who appears
to be a householder, desiring food, with downcast countenance;
evidently come from a long journey, and with all his senses impaired by
hunger. So is not he a man to whom food ought to be given?&rdquo;
Having gone through these reflections, the kind woman took up in her
hands a vessel full of rice boiled in milk, with ghee and sugar, and
brought it, and courteously presented it to him, and said; &ldquo;Go
and eat this somewhere on the bank of the lake, for this place is unfit
to eat in, as it is filled with feasting Br&aacute;hmans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and took the vessel of rice,
and placed it at no great distance under a banyan-tree on the edge of
the lake; and he washed his hands and feet in the lake, and rinsed his
mouth, and then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296"
name="pb296">296</a>]</span>came back in high spirits to eat the rice.
But while he was thus engaged, a kite, holding a black cobra with its
beak and claws, came from some place or other, and sat on that tree.
And it so happened that poisonous saliva issued from the mouth of that
dead snake, which the bird had captured and was carrying along. The
saliva fell into the dish of rice which was placed underneath the tree,
and Harisv&aacute;min, without observing it, came and ate up that
rice.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9300src" href="#xd27e9300" name=
"xd27e9300src">6</a> As soon as in his hunger he had devoured all that
food, he began to suffer terrible agonies produced by the poison. He
exclaimed, &ldquo;When fate has turned against a man, everything in
this world turns also; accordingly this rice dressed with milk, ghee
and sugar, has become poison to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, Harisv&aacute;min, tortured with the poison, tottered
to the house of that Br&aacute;hman, who was engaged in the sacrifice,
and said to his wife; &ldquo;The rice, which you gave me, has poisoned
me; so fetch me quickly a charmer who can counteract the operation of
poison; otherwise you will be guilty of the death of a
Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo; When Harisv&aacute;min had said this to the good
woman, who was beside herself to think what it could all mean, his eyes
closed, and he died.</p>
<p>Accordingly the Br&aacute;hman, who was engaged in a sacrifice,
drove out of his house his wife, though she was innocent and
hospitable, being enraged with her for the supposed murder of her
guest. The good woman, for her part, having incurred groundless blame
from her charitable deed, and so become branded with infamy, went to a
holy bathing-place to perform penance.</p>
<p>Then there was a discussion before the superintendent of religion,
as to which of the four parties, the kite, the snake, and the couple
who gave the rice, were guilty of the murder of a Br&aacute;hman, but
the question was not decided.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9315src" href=
"#xd27e9315" name="xd27e9315src">7</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you, king Trivikramasena, must tell me, which was guilty
of the murder of a Br&aacute;hman; and if you do not, you will incur
the before-mentioned curse.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297"
href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the king heard this from the Vet&aacute;la, he was forced by
the curse to break silence, and he said, &ldquo;No one of them could be
guilty of the crime; certainly not the serpent, for how could he be
guilty of anything, when he was the helpless prey of his enemy, who was
devouring him? To come to the kite; what offence did he commit in
bringing his natural food which he had happened to find, and eating it,
when he was hungry? And how could either of the couple, that gave the
food, be in fault, since they were both people exclusively devoted to
righteousness, not likely to commit a crime? Therefore I think the
guilt of slaying a Br&aacute;hman would attach to any person, who
should be so foolish as, for want of sufficient reflection, to
attribute it to either of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, the Vet&aacute;la again left his
shoulder, and went to his own place, and the resolute king again
followed him.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Merchant&rsquo;s daughter who fell in
love with a thief.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city of the name of Ayodhy&aacute;, which
was the capital of Vish&#7751;u, when he was incarnate as R&aacute;ma,
the destroyer of the R&aacute;kshasa race. In it there lived a mighty
king, of the name of V&iacute;raketu, who defended this earth, as a
rampart defends a city. During the reign of that king there lived in
that city a great merchant, named Ratnadatta, who was the head of the
mercantile community. And there was born to him, by his wife
Nandayant&iacute;, a daughter named Ratnavat&iacute;, who was obtained
by propitiating the deities. And that intelligent girl grew up in her
father&rsquo;s house, and as her body grew, her innate qualities of
beauty, gracefulness, and modesty developed also. And when she attained
womanhood, not only great merchants, but even kings asked her in
marriage from her father. But she disliked the male sex so much that
she did not desire even Indra for a husband, and would not even hear of
marriage, being determined to die, sooner than consent to it. That made
her father secretly sorrow much, on account of his affection for her,
and the report of her conduct spread all over the city of
Ayodhy&aacute;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298"
name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time all the citizens were continually being plundered by
thieves, so they assembled together, and made this complaint to king
V&iacute;raketu; &ldquo;Your Majesty, we are continually being robbed
by thieves every night, and we cannot detect them, so let your Highness
take the necessary steps.&rdquo; When the king had received this
petition from the citizens, he stationed watchmen in plain clothes all
round the city, in order to try and discover the thieves.</p>
<p>But they could not find them out, and the city went on being robbed;
so one night the king himself went out to watch; and as he was roaming
about armed, he saw in a certain part of the town a single individual
going along the rampart. He shewed great dexterity in his movements, as
he made his footfall perfectly noiseless, and he often looked behind
him with eyes anxiously rolling. The king said to himself,
&ldquo;Without doubt this is the thief, who sallies out by himself and
plunders my city;&rdquo; so he went up to him. Then the thief, seeing
the king, said to him, &ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; and the king answered
him, &ldquo;I am a thief<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; Then the thief said, &ldquo;Bravo! you
are my friend, as you belong to the same profession as myself; so come
to my house, I will entertain you.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he
consented, and went with him to his dwelling, which was in an
underground cavern in a forest. It was luxuriously and magnificently
furnished, illuminated by blazing lamps, and looked like a second
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, not governed by king Bali.</p>
<p>When the king had entered, and had taken a seat, the robber went
into the inner rooms of his cave-dwelling. At that moment a female
slave came and said to the king, &ldquo;Great Sir, how came you to
enter this mouth of death? This man is a notable thief; no doubt, when
he comes out from those rooms, he will do you some injury: I assure
you, he is treacherous; so leave this place at once.&rdquo; When the
king heard this, he left the place at once, and went to his own palace
and got ready his forces that very night.</p>
<p>And when his army was ready for battle, he came and blockaded the
entrance of that robber&rsquo;s cave with his troops, who sounded all
their martial instruments.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9364src" href=
"#xd27e9364" name="xd27e9364src">1</a> Then the brave robber, as his
hold was blockaded, knew that his secret had been discovered, and he
rushed out to fight, determined to die. And when he came out, he
displayed superhuman prowess in battle; alone, armed with sword and
shield, he cut off the trunks of elephants, he slashed off the legs of
horses, and lopped off the heads of soldiers. When he had made this
havoc among the soldiers, the king himself attacked him. And the king,
who was a skilful swordsman, by a dexterous trick of fence forced his
sword from his hand, and then the dagger which he drew; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>as he was now disarmed, the king threw away his
own weapon, and grappling with him, flung him on the earth, and
captured him alive. And he brought him back as a prisoner to his own
capital, with all his wealth. And he gave orders that he should be put
to death by impalement next morning.</p>
<p>Now, when that robber was being conducted with beat of drum to the
place of execution, that merchant&rsquo;s daughter Ratnavat&iacute; saw
him from her palace. Though he was wounded, and his body was begrimed
with dust, she was distracted with love as soon as she saw him, so she
went and said to her father Ratnadatta, &ldquo;I select as my husband
this man here, who is being led off to execution, so ransom him from
the king, my father; if you will not, I shall follow him to the other
world.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When her
father heard this he said, &ldquo;My daughter, what is this that you
say? Before you would not accept suitors endowed with all virtues,
equal to the god of love. How comes it that you are now in love with an
infamous brigand chief?&rdquo; Though her father used this argument,
and others of the same kind with her, she remained fixed in her
determination. Then the merchant went quickly to the king, and offered
him all his wealth, if he would grant the robber his life. But the king
would not make over to him, even for hundreds of crores of gold pieces,
that thief who had robbed on such a gigantic scale, and whom he had
captured at the risk of his own life. Then the father returned
disappointed, and his daughter made up her mind to follow the thief to
the other world, though her relations tried to dissuade her; so she
bathed, and got into a palanquin, and went to the spot where his
execution was taking place, followed by her father and mother and the
people, all weeping.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the robber had been impaled by the executioners,
and as his life was ebbing away on the stake, he saw her coming there
with her kinsfolk. And when he heard the whole story from the people,
he wept for a moment, and then he laughed a little, and then died on
the stake. Then the merchant&rsquo;s virtuous daughter had the
thief&rsquo;s body taken down from the stake, and she ascended the
funeral pyre with it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9379src" href=
"#xd27e9379" name="xd27e9379src">2</a></p>
<p>And at that very moment the holy &#346;iva, who was invisibly
present in the cemetery, spake from the air, &ldquo;Faithful wife, I am
pleased with thy devotedness to thy self-chosen husband, so crave a
boon of me.&rdquo; When she heard that, she worshipped and prayed the
god of gods to grant her the following boon, &ldquo;Lord, may my
father, who has now no sons, have a hundred, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>for
otherwise, as he has no children but me, he would abandon his
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9397src" href="#xd27e9397"
name="xd27e9397src">3</a> When the good woman had said this, the god
once more spake to her, saving, &ldquo;Let thy father have a hundred
sons! choose another boon; for such a steadfastly good woman, as thou
art, deserves something more than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she heard this, she said, &ldquo;If the Lord is pleased with
me, then let this husband of mine rise up alive, and be henceforth a
well conducted man!&rdquo; Thereupon &#346;iva, invisible in the air,
uttered these words, &ldquo;Be it so; let thy husband rise up alive,
and lead henceforth a life of virtue, and let king V&iacute;raketu be
pleased with him!&rdquo; And immediately the robber rose up alive with
unwounded limbs.</p>
<p>Then the merchant Ratnadatta was delighted, and astonished at the
same time; and with his daughter Ratnavat&iacute; and the bandit his
son-in-law, and his delighted relations, he entered his own palace, and
as he had obtained from the god the promise of sons, he held a feast
suitable to his own joy on the occasion. And when king V&iacute;raketu
heard what had taken place, he was pleased, and he immediately summoned
that heroic thief, and made him commander of his army. And thereupon
the heroic thief gave up his dishonest life, and married the
merchant&rsquo;s daughter, and led a respectable life, honoured by the
king.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, seated on the shoulder of king
Trivikramasena, had told him this tale, he asked him the following
question, menacing him with the before-mentioned curse; &ldquo;Tell me,
king, why that thief, when impaled, first wept and then laughed, when
he saw the merchant&rsquo;s daughter come with her father.&rdquo; Then
the king said; &ldquo;He wept for sorrow that he had not been able to
repay the merchant for his gratuitous kindness to him; and he laughed
out of astonishment, as he said to himself, &lsquo;What! has this
maiden, after rejecting kings who asked for her hand, fallen in love
with me? In truth a woman&rsquo;s heart is an intricate
labyrinth.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the king had said this, the mighty
Vet&aacute;la, by means of the magic power which he possessed, again
left the king&rsquo;s shoulder and returned to his station on the tree,
and the king once more went to fetch him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Story of the magic globule.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in the kingdom of Nep&aacute;la a city named
&#346;ivapura, and in it there lived of old time a king rightly named
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu. He devolved upon his minister, named
Prajn&aacute;s&aacute;gara, the burden of his kingdom, and enjoyed
himself in the society of his queen Chandraprabh&aacute;. And in course
of time that king had born to him, by that queen, a daughter named
&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;, bright as the moon, the eye of the
world.</p>
<p>Now in course of time she grew up to womanhood, and one day, in the
month of spring, she went to a garden, with her attendants, to witness
a festive procession. And in a certain part of that garden a
Br&aacute;hman, of the name of Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min, the son of a
rich man, who had come to see the procession, beheld her engaged in
gathering flowers, raising her lithe arm, and displaying her graceful
shape; and she looked charming when the grasp of her thumb and
forefinger on the stalks of the flowers relaxed. When the young man
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min saw her, she at once robbed him of his heart,
and he was bewildered by love and no longer master of his
feelings.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9427src" href="#xd27e9427" name=
"xd27e9427src">1</a> He said to himself, &ldquo;Can this be Rati come
in person to gather the flowers accumulated by spring, in order to make
arrows for the god of love? Or is it the presiding goddess of the wood,
come to worship the spring?&rdquo; While he was making these surmises,
the princess caught sight of him. And as soon as she saw him, looking
like a second god of love created with a body, she forgot her flowers,
and her limbs, and her own personal identity.</p>
<p>While those two were thus overpowered by the passion of mutual love
at first sight, a loud shout of alarm was raised, and they both looked
with uplifted heads to see what it could mean. Then there came that way
an elephant, rushing along with its elephant-hook hanging down, that
driven furious by perceiving the smell of another elephant,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9435src" href="#xd27e9435" name="xd27e9435src">2</a>
had broken its fastenings, and rushed out in a state of frenzy,
breaking down the trees in its path, and had thrown its driver. The
princess&rsquo;s attendants dispersed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>terror, but
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min eagerly rushed forward, and took her up alone
in his arms, and while she clung timidly to him, bewildered with fear,
love, and shame, carried her to a distance, out of reach of the
elephant. Then her attendants came up and praised that noble
Br&aacute;hman, and conducted her back to her palace. But as she went,
she frequently turned round to look at her deliverer. There she
remained, thinking regretfully of that man who had saved her life,
consumed day and night by the smouldering fire of love.</p>
<p>And Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min then left that garden, and seeing that
the princess had entered her private apartments, he said to himself, in
regretful longing, &ldquo;I cannot remain without her, nay I cannot
live without her: so my only resource in this difficulty is the cunning
M&uacute;ladeva, who is a master of magic arts.&rdquo; Having thus
reflected, he managed to get through that day, and the next morning he
went to visit that master of magic, M&uacute;ladeva. And he saw that
master, who was ever in the company of his friend &#346;a&#347;in, full
of many marvellous magic ways, like the sky come down to earth in human
shape.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9448src" href="#xd27e9448" name=
"xd27e9448src">3</a> And he humbly saluted him, and told him his
desire; then the master laughed, and promised to accomplish it for him.
Then that matchless deceiver M&uacute;ladeva placed a magic
globule<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9458src" href="#xd27e9458" name=
"xd27e9458src">4</a> in his mouth, and transformed himself into an aged
Br&aacute;hman; and he gave the Br&aacute;hman <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9461" title=
"Source: Manah&#7779;v&aacute;min">Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min</span> a
second globule to put in his mouth, and so made him assume the
appearance of a beautiful maiden. And that prince of villains took him
in this disguise to the judgment-hall of the king, the father of his
lady-love, and said to him, &ldquo;O king, I have only one son, and I
asked for a maiden to be given him to wife, and brought her from a long
distance; but now he has gone somewhere or other, and I am going to
look for him; so keep this maiden safe for me until I bring back my
son, for you keep safe under your protection the whole
world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9464src" href="#xd27e9464"
name="xd27e9464src">5</a> When king Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu heard this
petition, he granted it, fearing a curse if he did not, and summoned
his daughter <span class="corr" id="xd27e9467" title=
"Source: &#346;asiprabh&aacute;">&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;</span>,
and said to her; &ldquo;Daughter, keep this maiden in your palace, and
let her sleep and take her meals with you.&rdquo; The princess agreed,
and took Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min transformed into a maiden to her own
private apartments; and then M&uacute;ladeva, who had assumed the form
of a Br&aacute;hman, went where he pleased, and
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min remained in the form of a maiden with his
beloved.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9471src" href="#xd27e9471" name=
"xd27e9471src">6</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>And in a few days the princess became quite fond of and intimate
with her new attendant; so, one night when she was pining at being
separated from the object of her affections, and tossing on her couch,
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min, who was on a bed near her, concealed under a
female shape, said secretly to her, &ldquo;My dear
&#346;a[s&rsquo;]iprabh&aacute;, why are you pale of hue, and why do
you grow thinner every day, and sorrow as one separated from the side
of her beloved? Tell me, for why should you distrust loving modest
attendants? From this time forth I will take no food until you tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess heard this, she sighed, and slowly told the
following tale; &ldquo;Why should I distrust you of all people? Listen,
friend, I will tell you the cause. Once on a time I went to a spring
garden to see a procession, and there I beheld a handsome young
Br&aacute;hman, who seemed like the month of spring, having the
loveliness of the moon free from dew, kindling love at sight, adorning
the grove with play of light. And while my eager eyes, drinking in the
nectarous rays of the moon of his countenance, began to emulate the
partridge, there came there a mighty elephant broken loose from its
bonds, roaring and distilling its ichor like rain, looking like a black
rain-cloud appearing out of season. My attendants dispersed terrified
at that elephant, but when I was bewildered with fear, that young
Br&aacute;hman caught me up in his arms and carried me to a distance.
Then contact with his body made me feel as if I were anointed with
sandal-wood ointment, and bedewed with ambrosia, and I was in a state
which I cannot describe. And in a moment my attendants re-assembled,
and I was brought back reluctant to this my palace, and seemed to
myself to have been cast down to earth from heaven. From that time
forth I have often interviews in reveries with my beloved, that rescued
me from death, and even when awake I seem to see him at my side. And
when asleep I see him in dreams, coaxing me and dispelling my reserve
with kisses and caresses. But, ill-fated wretch that I am, I cannot
obtain him, for I am baffled by ignorance of his name and other
particulars about him. So I am consumed, as you see, by the fire of
separation from the lord of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min&rsquo;s ears had been filled with the
nectar of this speech of the princess&rsquo;s, that Br&aacute;hman, who
was present there in female form<span class="corr" id="xd27e9481"
title="Source: ,,">,</span> rejoiced, and considered that his object
was attained, and that the time had come for revealing himself, so he
took out the globule from his mouth, and displayed himself in his true
form, and said; &ldquo;Rolling-eyed one, I am that very Br&aacute;hman,
whom you bought with a look in the garden, and made your slave in the
truest sense of the word. And from the immediate interruption of our
acquaintance I derived that sorrow, of which the final result was my
taking, as you see, the form of a maiden. Therefore, fair one, grant
that the sorrow of separation, which both of us have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>endured, may not have been borne in vain, for
Cupid cannot endure beyond this point.&rdquo; When the princess
suddenly beheld her beloved in front of her, and heard him utter these
words, she was at once filled with love, astonishment, and shame. So
they eagerly went through the G&aacute;ndharva ceremony of marriage.
Then Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min lived happily in the palace, under two
shapes; keeping the globule in his mouth during the day and so wearing
a female shape, but at night taking it out, and assuming the form of a
man.</p>
<p>Now, as days went on, the brother-in-law of king
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, named M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, gave his own
daughter, named M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, in marriage to a
young Br&aacute;hman, the son of the minister
Prajn&aacute;s&aacute;gara: and with her he bestowed much wealth. And
the princess &#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute; was invited, on the occasion
of her cousin&rsquo;s marriage, to her uncle&rsquo;s house, and went
there accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting. And among them went the
young Br&aacute;hman, Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min, wearing the attractive
form of a young maiden of exquisite beauty.</p>
<p>Then that minister&rsquo;s son beheld him disguised in female form,
and was deeply pierced with the shafts of the archer Love. And when he
went to his house, accompanied by his bride, it seemed to him to be
empty; for he was robbed of his heart by that seeming maiden. Then he
continued to think of nothing but the beauty of that supposed
maiden&rsquo;s face, and bitten by the great snake of fierce passion,
he suddenly became distracted. The people, who were there, ceased from
their rejoicing, and in their bewilderment asked what it meant, and his
father Prajn&aacute;s&aacute;gara, hearing of it, came to him in haste.
And when his father tried to comfort him, he woke up from his stupor
and uttered what was in his mind, babbling deliriously. And that father
of his was very much troubled, as he thought that the matter was one
altogether beyond his power. Then the king heard of it, and came there
in person. And he at once saw that the minister&rsquo;s son had been in
a moment reduced by strong passion to the seventh<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9490src" href="#xd27e9490" name="xd27e9490src">7</a> stage of
love-sickness; so he said to his ministers; &ldquo;How can I give him a
maiden whom a Br&aacute;hman left in my care? And yet, if he does not
obtain her, he will without doubt reach the last stage. If he dies, his
father, who is my minister, will perish; and if he perishes, my kingdom
is ruined, so tell me what I am to do in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this, all those ministers said, &ldquo;They say
that the special virtue of a king is the protection of the virtue of
his subjects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>Now the root of this protection is counsel, and
counsel resides in counsellors. If the counsellor perishes, protection
perishes in its root, and virtue is certain to be impaired.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9503src" href="#xd27e9503" name="xd27e9503src">8</a>
Moreover guilt would be incurred by causing the death of this
Br&aacute;hman minister and his son, so you must avoid doing that,
otherwise there is a great chance of your infringing the law of virtue.
Accordingly you must certainly give to the minister&rsquo;s son the
maiden committed to your care by the first Br&aacute;hman, and if he
returns after the lapse of some time, and is angry, steps can then be
taken to put matters right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ministers said this to the king, he agreed to give that
man, who was palming himself off as a maiden, to the minister&rsquo;s
son. And after fixing an auspicious moment, he brought
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min, in female form, from the palace of the
princess; and he said to the king; &ldquo;If, king, you are determined
to give me, whom another committed to your care, to a person other than
him for whom I was intended, I must, I suppose, acquiesce; you are a
king, and justice and injustice are matters familiar to you. But I
consent to the marriage on this condition only, that I am not to be
considered as a wife until my husband has spent six months in visiting
holy bathing-places, and returns home; if this condition is not agreed
to, know that I will bite my own tongue in two, and so commit
suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young man, disguised in female form, had prescribed this
condition, the king informed the minister&rsquo;s son of it, and he was
consoled, and accepted the terms; and he quickly went through the
ceremony of marriage, and placed in one house
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; his first wife, and his second
supposed wife, carefully guarded, and, like a fool, went on a
pilgrimage to holy bathing-places, to please the object of his
affections.</p>
<p>And Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min, in female form, dwelt in the same
house with M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, as the partner of her bed
and board. And one night, while he was living there in this way,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; said to him secretly in the
bed-chamber, while their attendants were sleeping outside, &ldquo;My
friend, I cannot sleep, tell me some tale.&rdquo; When the young man,
disguised in female form, heard this, he told her the story, how in old
time a royal sage, named I&#7693;a, of the race of the sun, assumed, in
consequence of the curse of Gaur&iacute;, a female form that fascinated
the whole world, and how he and Budha fell in love with one another at
first sight, meeting one another in a shrubbery in the grounds of a
temple, and were there united, and how Pur&uacute;ravas was the fruit
of that union. When the artful creature had told this story, he went on
to say, &ldquo;So by the fiat of a deity or by charms and drugs, a man
may sometimes become a woman, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, and in this
way even great ones do sometimes unite impelled by love.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the tender fair one, who regretted her husband, who had left
her as soon as the marriage had taken place, heard this, she said to
her supposed rival, in whom she had come to confide by living with her,
&ldquo;This story makes my body tremble and my heart, as it were, sink;
so tell me friend, what is the meaning of this.&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman, disguised in female form, heard this, he went on to
say, &ldquo;My friend, these are violent symptoms of love; I have felt
them myself, I will not conceal it from you.&rdquo; When she said this,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; went on slowly to say, &ldquo;Friend,
I love you as my life, so why should I not say what I think it is time
to reveal? Could any one by any artifice be introduced into this
palace?&rdquo; When the pupil of that master-rogue heard this, he took
her meaning and said to her, &ldquo;If this is the state of affairs,
then I have something to tell you. I have a boon from Vish&#7751;u, by
which I can at pleasure become a man during the night, so I will now
become one for your sake.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> So he took the globule out of his mouth,
and displayed himself to her as a handsome man in the prime of youth.
And so the Br&aacute;hman lived with the wife of the minister&rsquo;s
son, becoming a woman in the day, and resuming his male form at night.
But hearing in a few days that the son of the minister was on the point
of returning, he took the precaution of eloping with her from that
house during the night.</p>
<p>At this point in the story, it happened that his teacher,
M&uacute;ladeva, heard all the circumstances; so he again assumed the
form of an old Br&aacute;hman, and accompanied by his friend
<span class="corr" id="xd27e9527" title=
"Source: &#346;a&#347;i">&#346;a&#347;in</span>, who had assumed the
form of a young Br&aacute;hman, he went and respectfully said to king
Ya&#347;ah&#803;ketu, &ldquo;I have brought back my son; so give me my
daughter-in-law.&rdquo; Then the king, who was afraid of being cursed,
deliberated and said to him; &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I do not know where
your daughter-in-law has gone, so forgive me; as I am in fault, I will
give you my own daughter for your son.&rdquo; When the king had said
this to that prince of rogues, disguised in the form of an old
Br&aacute;hman, who asserted his false claim with the sternness of
assumed anger, he gave his daughter with all due ceremonies to his
friend &#346;a&#347;in, who pretended to be the supposed
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son. Then M&uacute;ladeva took the bride and
bridegroom, who had been thus united, off to his own home, without
showing any desire for the king&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>And there Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min met them, and a fierce dispute
took place between him and &#346;a&#347;in in the presence of that
M&uacute;ladeva. Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min said, &ldquo;This
&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute; should be given to me, for long ago, when
she was a maiden, I married her by the favour of the master.&rdquo;
&#346;a&#347;in said, &ldquo;You fool, what have you to do with her?
she is my wife, for her father bestowed her on me in the presence of
the fire.&rdquo; So they went on wrangling about the princess, whom
they had got hold <span class="corr" id="xd27e9532" title=
"Source: off">of</span> by means of magic, and their dispute was never
decided. So tell me, king, to which of the two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>does
that wife belong? Resolve my doubt; the conditions of non-compliance
are those which I mentioned before.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When king Trivikramasena was thus addressed by the Vet&aacute;la on
his shoulder, he gave him this answer: &ldquo;I consider that the
princess is the lawful wife of &#346;a&#347;in, since she was openly
given to him by her father in the lawful way. But
Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min married her in an underhand way, like a thief,
by the G&aacute;ndharva rite; and a thief has no lawful title to the
possessions of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard this answer of the king&rsquo;s, he
quickly left his shoulder, and went back to his own place, and the king
hurried after him.</p>

<p class="first">Oesterley tells us that in the Turkish
T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah (Rosen, II, p. 178,) a sorceress takes
the place of M&uacute;ladeva. She gives the young man a small seal in
place of the pill or globule. He is then married to a son of the
king&rsquo;s. Then the young man escapes with the princess, who in the
day keeps the seal in her mouth and so appears as a man; then the
sorceress goes in the form of a Br&aacute;hman to the king, who has to
give her 10,000 gold pieces as he cannot give back her daughter. The
story is No. 23 in the Persian T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah, Iken, p.
97. Oesterley refers also to the story in the 7th Chapter of the
Kath&aacute; Sarit S&aacute;gara; (Oesterley&rsquo;s Bait&aacute;l
Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pages 203&ndash;205). The tale in one way
resembles the Greek fable of C&aelig;neus, and also that of Tiresias.
The story of Iphis and Ianthe is perhaps still more apposite. According
to Sir Thomas Brown, (Vulgar Errors, Book III, ch. 17) hares are
supposed by some to be both male and female. He mentions Tiresias and
Empedocles as instances of &ldquo;transexion.&rdquo; <span class="corr"

upon their deities as belonging to both sexes at once.</span></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this earth a great mountain named Himavat,
where all jewels are found, which is the origin of both Gaur&iacute;
and Gang&aacute;, the two goddesses dear to &#346;iva. Even heroes
cannot reach its top;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9572src" href=
"#xd27e9572" name="xd27e9572src">2</a> it towers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>proudly above all other mountains; and as such
its praises are sung in strains of sooth in the three worlds. On the
ridge of that Himavat there is that city rightly named the Golden City,
which gleams like a mass of the sun&rsquo;s rays deposited by him on
earth.</p>
<p>Of old there lived in that splendid city a fortunate lord of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu, who dwelt there
like Indra on Meru. In his palace-garden there was a wishing-tree,
which was an heirloom in his family, which was well known as the
Granter of Desires, and not named so without reason. The king
supplicated that divine tree, and obtained by its favour a son, who
remembered his former birth, and was the incarnation of a portion of a
Bodhisattva. He was a hero in munificence, of great courage,
compassionate to all creatures, attentive to the instructions of his
spiritual adviser, and his name was J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana.
And when he grew up to manhood, his father, the king, made him
crown-prince, being impelled thereto by his excellent qualities, and
the advice of the ministers.</p>
<p>And when J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was made crown-prince,
the ministers of his father, desiring his welfare, came to him and
said, &ldquo;Prince, you must continually worship this wishing-tree
invincible by all creatures,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9584src" href=
"#xd27e9584" name="xd27e9584src">3</a> which grants all our desires.
For, as long as we have this, not even Indra could injure us, much less
any other enemy.&rdquo; When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana heard
this, he inly reflected, &ldquo;Alas! our predecessors, though they
possessed such a divine tree, never obtained from it any fruit worthy
of it; some of them asked it for wealth and did nothing more; so the
mean creatures made themselves and this noble tree contemptible. Well,
I will make it inserve a design which I have in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the noble prince had formed this resolution, he went to his
father, and gained his goodwill by paying him all kinds of attentions,
and said to him in private, as he was sitting at ease; &ldquo;Father,
you know that in this sea of mundane existence, all that we behold is
unsubstantial, fleeting as the twinkling of the wave. Especially are
the twilight, the dawn, and Fortune shortlived, disappearing as soon as
revealed; where and when have they been seen to abide? Charity to
one&rsquo;s neighbour is the only thing that is permanent in this cycle
of change; it produces holiness and fame that bear witness for hundreds
of <i lang="sa-latn">yugas</i>. So with what object, father, do we keep
for ourselves such an unfailing wishing-tree, as all these phenomenal
conditions are but momentary? Where, I ask, are those our predecessors
who kept it so strenuously, exclaiming, &lsquo;It is mine, it is
mine?&rsquo; Where is it now to them? For which of them does it exist,
and which of them exists for it? So, if you permit, father, I will
employ this wishing-tree, that grants all desires, for attaining the
matchless fruit of charity to one&rsquo;s neighbour.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>His father gave him leave, saying, &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; And
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana went and said to the wishing-tree,
&ldquo;O god, thou didst fulfil all the cherished wishes of our
predecessors, so fulfil this one solitary wish of mine! Enable me to
behold this whole earth free from poverty; depart, and good luck attend
thee; thou art bestowed by me on the world that desires wealth.&rdquo;
When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana had said this with joined hands,
a voice came forth from the tree, &ldquo;Since thou hast relinquished
me, I depart.&rdquo; And in a moment the wishing-tree flew up to
heaven, and rained wealth on the earth so plenteously, that there was
not one poor man left on it. Then the glory of that
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana spread through the three worlds, on
account of that ardent compassion of his for all creatures.</p>
<p>That made all his relations impatient with envy; and thinking that
he and his father would be easy to conquer, as they were deprived of
the calamity-averting tree which they had bestowed on the world, they
put their heads together and formed a design, and then girded on their
harness for war, to deprive J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana and his
father of their realm. When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana saw that,
he said to his father, &ldquo;Father, what other has might, when thou
hast taken up arms? But what generous man desires to possess a realm,
if he must do so by slaying his relations for the sake of this wicked
perishable body? So of what use is sovereignty to us? We will depart to
some other place, and practise virtue that brings happiness in both
worlds<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Let these
miserable relations that covet our kingdom, joy their fill!&rdquo; When
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said this, his father
J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu answered him, &ldquo;My son, I desire a realm
for your sake only; if you, being penetrated with compassion, give it
up, of what value is it to me, who am old?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s father agreed to his
proposal, he went with him and his mother to the Malaya mountain,
abandoning his kingdom. There he made him a retreat in the valley of a
brook, the stream of which was hidden by sandal-wood trees, and spent
his time in waiting on his parents. And there he made a friend of the
name of Mitr&aacute;vasu, the son of Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu a king of
the Siddhas, who dwelt on that mountain.</p>
<p>Now, one day, as <span class="corr" id="xd27e9614" title=
"Source: J&iacute;mutav&aacute;hana">J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana</span>
was roaming about, he went into a temple of the goddess Gaur&iacute;,
that was situated in a garden, in order to worship in the presence of
the image. And there he saw a beautiful maiden accompanied by her
attendants, playing on the lyre, intent on pleasing the daughter of the
mountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9617src" href="#xd27e9617" name=
"xd27e9617src">4</a> And the deer were listening to the sweet sound of
the lyre in the musical performance, standing motionless, as if abashed
at beholding the beauty of her eyes.<a class="noteref" id=

black pupil in her white eye, and it seemed as if it strove to

and elegant in her waist, which appeared as if the Creator had
compressed it in his grasp, when making her, and deeply impressed on it
the marks of his fingers in the form of wrinkles. The moment
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana saw that beauty, it seemed as if she
entered by his eyes, and stole away his heart. And when the maiden saw
him, adorning the garden, producing longing and disturbance of soul,
looking as if he were the god of spring retired to the forest through
disgust at the burning up of the body of the god of Love, she was
overpowered with affection, and so bewildered, that her lyre, as if it
had been a friend, became distracted and mute.</p>
<p>Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e9641" title=
"Source: J&iacute;mutav&aacute;hana">J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana</span>
said to an attendant of hers, &ldquo;What is your friend&rsquo;s
auspicious name, and what family does she adorn?&rdquo; When the
attendant heard that, she said, &ldquo;She is the sister of
Mitr&aacute;vasu, and the daughter of Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu the king of
the Siddhas, and her name is <span class="corr" id="xd27e9644" title=
"Source: Malyavat&iacute;">Malayavat&iacute;</span>.&rdquo; When she
had said this to <span class="corr" id="xd27e9647" title=
"Source: J&iacute;mutav&aacute;hana">J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana</span>,
the discreet woman asked the son of the hermit, who had come with him,
his name and descent, and then she made this brief remark to
Malayavat&iacute;, smiling as she spoke, &ldquo;My friend, why do you
not welcome this prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas who has come here?
For he is a guest worthy of being honoured by the whole world.&rdquo;
When she said this, that daughter of the king of the Siddhas was
silent, and her face was cast down through shame. Then her attendant
said to <span class="corr" id="xd27e9650" title=
"Source: J&iacute;m&uacute;tavahana">J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana</span>,
&ldquo;The princess is bashful, permit me to shew you the proper
courtesy in her place.&rdquo; So she alone gave him a garland with the
<i lang="sa-latn">arghya</i>. J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, as
soon as the garland was given to him, being full of love, took it, and
threw it round the neck of Malayavat&iacute;. And she, looking at him
with loving sidelong looks, placed, as it were, a garland of blue
lotuses on him.</p>
<p>Thus they went through a sort of silent ceremony of mutual election,
and then a maid came and said to that Siddha maiden, &ldquo;Princess,
your mother desires your presence, come at once.&rdquo; When the
princess heard that, she withdrew regretfully and reluctantly from the
face of her beloved her gaze, that seemed to be fastened to it with the
arrows of love, and managed not without a struggle to return to her
house. And J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, with his mind fixed on
her, returned to his hermitage.</p>
<p>And when Malayavat&iacute; had seen her mother, she went at once and
flung herself down on her bed, sick of separation from her beloved.
Then her eyes were clouded, as it were by the smoke of the fire of love
that burnt in her bosom, she shed floods of tears, and her body was
tortured with heat; and though her attendants anointed her with
sandal-wood unguent, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>fanned her with the leaves of
lotuses, she could not obtain any relief on the bed, in the lap of her
attendant, or on the ground. Then the day retired somewhere with the
glowing evening, and the moon ascending kissed the laughing forehead of
the east, and though urged on by love she was too bashful to send a
female messenger to her chosen one, or to adopt any of the measures
that lovers usually take, but she seemed loth to live. And she was
contracted in her heart, and she passed that night, which the moon made
<span class="corr" id="xd27e9662" title=
"Source: disagreable">disagreeable</span> to her, like a lotus which
closes at night, and bewilderment hung round her, like a cloud of
bees.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who was
tortured at parting with her, though lying on his bed, spent the night
as one who had fallen into the hand of Cupid; though his glow of love
was of recent birth, a pallid hue began to shew itself in him; and
though shame made him dumb, he uttered the pain which love
produced.</p>
<p>Next morning he returned with excessive longing to that temple of
Gaur&iacute;, where he had seen the daughter of the king of the
Siddhas. And while, distracted with the fire of passion, he was being
consoled by the hermit&rsquo;s son, who had followed him there,
Malayavat&iacute; also came there; for, as she could not bear
separation, she had secretly gone out alone into a solitary place to
abandon the body. And the girl, not seeing her lover, who was separated
from her by a tree, thus prayed, with eyes full of tears, to the
goddess Gaur&iacute;, &ldquo;Goddess, though my devotion to thee has
not made J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana my husband in this life, let
him be so in my next life!&rdquo; As soon as she had said this, she
made a noose with her upper garment, and fastened it to the branch of
the <i lang="sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree in front of the temple of
Gaur&iacute;. And she said &ldquo;Prince
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, lord renowned over the whole world,
how is it, that, though thou art compassionate, thou hast not delivered
me?&rdquo; When she had said this, she was proceeding to fasten the
noose round her throat, but at that very moment a voice spoken by the
goddess came from the air, &ldquo;Daughter, do not act recklessly, for
the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, the
future emperor, shall be thy husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the goddess said this, J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana also
heard it, and seeing his beloved, he went up to her, and his friend
accompanied him. And his friend, the hermit&rsquo;s son, said to the
young lady, &ldquo;See, here is that very bridegroom whom the goddess
has in reality bestowed upon you.&rdquo; And
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, uttering many tender loving
speeches, removed with his own hand the noose from her neck. Then they
seemed to have experienced, as it were, a sudden shower of nectar, and
Malayavat&iacute; remained with bashful eye, drawing lines upon the
ground. And at that moment, one of her companions, who was looking for
her, suddenly came up to her, and said in joyful accents,
&ldquo;Friend, you are lucky, and you are blessed with good fortune in
that you have obtained the very thing which you desired. For, this very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>day, prince Mitr&aacute;vasu said to the great
king, your father, in my hearing, &lsquo;Father, that Vidy&aacute;dhara
prince J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, the object of the
world&rsquo;s reverence, the bestower of the wishing-tree, who has come
here, should be complimented by us, as he is our guest; and we cannot
find any other match as good as him; so let us pay him a compliment by
bestowing on him this pearl of maidens Malayavat&iacute;.&rsquo; The
king approved, saying &lsquo;So be it&rsquo;, and your brother
Mitr&aacute;vasu has now gone to the hermitage of the illustrious
prince on this very errand. And I know that your marriage will take
place at once, so come back to your palace, and let this illustrious
prince also return to his dwelling.&rdquo; When the princess&rsquo;s
companion said this to her, she departed slowly from that place,
rejoicing and regretful, frequently turning her head.</p>
<p>And J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana also returned quickly to his
hermitage, and heard from Mitr&aacute;vasu, who came there, his
commission, which fulfilled all his wishes, and welcomed it with joy.
And as he remembered his former births, he gave him an account of one
in which Mitr&aacute;vasu was his friend, and Mitr&aacute;vasu&rsquo;s
sister his wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9679src" href="#xd27e9679"
name="xd27e9679src">7</a> Then Mitr&aacute;vasu was pleased, and
informed the parents of J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who were
also delighted, and returned, to the joy of his own parents, having
executed his mission successfully. And that very day he took
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana to his own house, and he made
preparations for the marriage festival with a magnificence worthy of
his magic power, and on that very same auspicious day he celebrated the
marriage of his sister to that Vidy&aacute;dhara prince; and then
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, having obtained the desire of his
heart, lived with his newly married wife Malayavat&iacute;. And once on
a time, as he was roaming about out of curiosity with Mitr&aacute;vasu
on that Malaya mountain, he reached a wood on the shore of the sea.
There he saw a great many heaps of bones, and he said to
Mitr&aacute;vasu, &ldquo;What creatures are these whose bones are piled
up here?&rdquo; Then his brother-in-law Mitr&aacute;vasu said to that
compassionate man, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you the story of this in
a few words. Long, long ago, Kadr&uacute; the mother of the snakes
conquered Vinat&aacute;, the mother of Garu&#7693;a, in a treacherous
wager, and made her a slave. Through enmity caused thereby, the mighty
Garu&#7693;a,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9682src" href="#xd27e9682"
name="xd27e9682src">8</a> though he had delivered his mother, began to
eat the snakes the sons of Kadr&uacute;. He was thenceforth continually
in the habit of entering P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and some he smote, some
he trampled, and some died of fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When V&aacute;suki, the king of the snakes, saw that, he
feared that his race would be annihilated at one fell swoop, so he
supplicated Garu&#7693;a, and made a compact with him, saying,
&lsquo;King of birds, I will send you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>one snake every day
to this shore of the southern sea for your meal. But you must by no
means enter P&aacute;t&aacute;la, for what advantage will you gain by
destroying the snakes at one blow?&rsquo; When the king of the snakes
said this, the mighty Garu&#7693;a saw that the proposal was to his
advantage, and agreed to it. And from that time forth, the king of
birds eats every day, on the shore of the sea, a snake sent by
V&aacute;suki. So these are heaps of bones of snakes devoured by
Garu&#7693;a, that have gradually accumulated in course of time, and
come to look like the peak of a mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, that treasure-house of
courage and compassion, had heard, inly grieving, this story from the
mouth of Mitr&aacute;vasu, he thus answered him, &ldquo;One cannot help
grieving for king V&aacute;suki, who, like a coward, offers up every
day his subjects to their enemy with his own hand. As he has a thousand
faces and a thousand mouths, why could he not say with one mouth to
Garu&#7693;a, &lsquo;Eat me first?&rsquo; And how could he be so
cowardly as to ask Garu&#7693;a to destroy his race, and so heartless
as to be able to listen continually unmoved to the lamentation of the
N&aacute;ga women?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9697src" href=
"#xd27e9697" name="xd27e9697src">9</a> And to think that Garu&#7693;a,
though the son of Ka&#347;yapa and a hero, and though sanctified by
being the bearer of <span class="corr" id="xd27e9704" title=
"Source: &#7730;rish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>, should do
such an evil deed! Alas the depths of delusion!&rdquo; When the
noble-hearted one had said this, he formed this wish in his heart,
&ldquo;May I obtain the one essential object in this world by the
sacrifice of the unsubstantial body! May I be so fortunate as to save
the life of one friendless terrified N&aacute;ga by offering myself to
Garu&#7693;a!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was going through these
reflections, a doorkeeper came from Mitr&aacute;vasu&rsquo;s father to
summon them, and J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana sent
Mitr&aacute;vasu home, saying to him, &ldquo;Go you on first, I will
follow.&rdquo; And after he had gone, the compassionate man roamed
about alone, intent on effecting the object he had in view, and he
heard afar off a piteous sound of weeping. And he went on, and saw near
a lofty rocky slab a young man of handsome appearance plunged in grief:
an officer of some monarch seemed to have just brought him and left him
there, and the young man was trying to induce by loving
persuasions<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9709src" href="#xd27e9709" name=
"xd27e9709src">10</a> an old woman, who was weeping there, to
return.</p>
<p>And while J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was listening there in
secret, melted with pity, eager to know who he could be, the old woman,
overwhelmed with the weight of her grief, began to look again and again
at the young man, and to lament his hard lot in the following words,
&ldquo;Alas &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a, you that were obtained by me
by means of a hundred pangs! Alas, virtuous one! Alas! son, the only
scion of our family, where shall I behold you again? Darling, when this
moon of your face is withdrawn, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>your father will fall into
the darkness of grief, and how will he live to old age? How will your
body, that would suffer even from the touch of the sun&rsquo;s rays, be
able to endure the agony of being devoured by Garu&#7693;a? How comes
it that Providence and the king of the snakes were able to find out
you, the only son of ill-starred me, though the world of the snakes is
wide?&rdquo; When she thus lamented, the young man her son said to her,
&ldquo;I am afflicted enough, as it is, mother; why do you afflict me
more? Return home; this is my last reverence to you, for I know it will
soon be time for Garu&#7693;a to arrive here.&rdquo; When the old woman
heard that, she cast her sorrowful eyes all round the horizon, and
cried aloud, &ldquo;I am undone; who will deliver my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, that portion of
a Bodhisattva, having heard and seen that, said to himself, being
profoundly touched with pity, &ldquo;I see, this is an unhappy snake,
of the name of &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a, who has now been sent by
king V&aacute;suki, to serve as food for Garu&#7693;a. And this is his
aged mother, whose only son he is, and who has followed him here out of
love, and is lamenting piteously from grief. So, if I cannot save this
wretched N&aacute;ga by offering up this exceedingly perishable body,
alas! my birth will have been void of fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana had gone through these
reflections, he went joyfully up to the old woman, and said to her,
&ldquo;Mother, I will deliver your son.&rdquo; When the old woman heard
that, she was alarmed and terrified, thinking that Garu&#7693;a had
come, and she cried out, &ldquo;Eat me, Garu&#7693;a, eat me!&rdquo;
Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e9723" title=
"Source: &#346;ankhachu&#7693;a">&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a</span>
said, &ldquo;Mother, do not be afraid, this is not Garu&#7693;a. There
is a great difference between this being who cheers one like the moon,
and the terrible Garu&#7693;a.&rdquo; When
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a said this,
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said, &ldquo;Mother, I am a
Vidy&aacute;dhara, come to deliver your son; for I will give my body,
disguised in clothes, to the hungry Garu&#7693;a; and do you return
home, taking your son with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old woman heard that, she said, &ldquo;By no means, for you
are my son in a still higher sense, because you have shewn such
compassion for us at such a time.&rdquo; When
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana heard that, he replied, &ldquo;You
two ought not to disappoint my wish in this matter.&rdquo; And when he
persistently urged this, &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a said to him;
&ldquo;Of a truth, noble-hearted man, you have displayed your
compassionate nature, but I cannot consent to save my body at the cost
of yours; for who ought to save a common stone by the sacrifice of a
gem? The world is full of people like myself, who feel pity only for
themselves, but people like you, who are inclined to feel pity for the
whole world, are few in number; besides, excellent man, I shall never
find it in my heart to defile the pure race of &#346;ankhap&aacute;la,
as a spot defiles the disk of the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a had in these words attempted to
dissuade him, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315"
name="pb315">315</a>]</span>said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, go back,
and leave this terrible wilderness. Do you not see here this rock of
execution, smeared with the clotted gore of snakes, awful as the
luxurious couch of Death! But I will go to the shore of the sea, and
worship the lord Gokar&#7751;a, and quickly return, before Garu&#7693;a
comes here.&rdquo; When &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a had said this, he
took a respectful leave of his sadly-wailing mother, and went to pay
his devotions to Gokar&#7751;a.</p>
<p>And J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana made up his mind that, if
Garu&#7693;a arrived in the meantime, he would certainly be able to
carry out his proposed self-sacrifice for the sake of another. And
while he was thus reflecting, he saw the trees swaying with the wind of
the wings of the approaching king of birds, and seeming, as it were, to
utter a cry of dissuasion. So he came to the conclusion that the moment
of Garu&#7693;a&rsquo;s arrival was at hand, and determined to offer up
his life for another, he ascended the rock of sacrifice. And the sea,
churned by the wind, seemed with the eyes of its bright-flashing jewels
to be gazing in astonishment at his extraordinary courage. Then
Garu&#7693;a came along, obscuring the heaven, and swooping down,
struck the great-hearted hero with his beak, and carried him off from
that slab of rock. And he quickly went off with him to a peak of the
Malaya mountain, to eat him there; and
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s crest-jewel was torn from his
head, and drops of blood fell from him, as he was carried through the
air. And while Garu&#7693;a was eating that moon of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e9735" title=
"Corrected by author from: Vidykdhara">Vidy&aacute;dhara</span> race,
he said to himself; &ldquo;May my body thus be offered in every birth
for the benefit of others, and let me not enjoy heaven or liberation,
if they are dissociated from the opportunity of benefiting my
neighbour<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; And
while he was saying this to himself, a rain of flowers fell from
heaven.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile his crest-jewel, dripping with his blood, had
fallen in front of his wife Malayavat&iacute;. When she saw it, she
recognized it with much trepidation as her husband&rsquo;s crest-jewel,
and as she was in the presence of her father-in-law and mother-in-law,
she shewed it them with tears. And they, when they saw their
son&rsquo;s crest-jewel, were at once beside themselves to think what
it could mean. Then king J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu and queen
Kanakavat&iacute; found out by their supernatural powers of meditation
the real state of the case, and proceeded to go quickly with their
daughter-in-law to the place where Garu&#7693;a and
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana were. In the meanwhile
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a returned from worshipping Gokar&#7751;a,
and saw, to his dismay, that that stone of sacrifice was wet with
blood. Then the worthy fellow exclaimed with tears, &ldquo;Alas! I am
undone, guilty creature that I am! Undoubtedly that great-hearted one,
in the fulness of his compassion, has given himself to Garu&#7693;a in
my stead. So I will find out to what place the enemy has carried him
off in this moment. If I find him alive, I shall escape sinking in the
mire of dishonour.&rdquo; While he said <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>this, he went
following up the track of the drops of blood, that he saw lying close
to one another on the ground.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Garu&#7693;a, who was engaged in devouring
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, saw that he was pleased; so he
immediately stopped, and said to himself; &ldquo;Strange! This must be
some matchless hero; for the great-hearted one rejoices even while I am
devouring him, but does not lose his life. And on so much of his body
as is not lacerated, he has all the hairs erect, as it were a coat of
mail; and his look is lovingly fixed on me, as if I were his
benefactor. So he cannot be a snake; he must be some saint; I will
cease from devouring him, and question him.&rdquo; While Garu&#7693;a
was thus musing, J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said to him;
&ldquo;King of birds, why do you desist? There is flesh and blood in my
body, and you are not satisfied as yet, so go on eating it.&rdquo; When
the king of birds heard this, he asked him with much astonishment,
&ldquo;Great-souled one, you are not a snake, so tell me who you
are.&rdquo; But J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana answered
Garu&#7693;a, &ldquo;In truth I am a N&aacute;ga; what is the meaning
of this question of yours? Do your kind, for who, that is not foolish,
would act<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9747src" href="#xd27e9747" name=
"xd27e9747src">11</a> contrary to the purpose he had
undertaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was giving this answer to Garu&#7693;a,
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a came near, and called out to Garu&#7693;a
from a distance, &ldquo;Do not do a rash and criminal deed, son of
Vinat&aacute;. What delusion is this that possesses you? He is not a
snake; lo! I am the snake designed for you.&rdquo; When
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a had said this, he came up quickly, and
standing between those two, and seeing Garu&#7693;a bewildered, he went
on to say; &ldquo;Why are you perplexed; do you not see that I have
hoods and two tongues; and do you not observe the charming appearance
of this Vidy&aacute;dhara?&rdquo; While &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a
was saying this, the wife and parents of
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana came there with speed. And his
parents, seeing him mangled, immediately cried out, &ldquo;Alas, son!
Alas, J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana! Alas, compassionate one who
have given your life for others! How could you, son of Vinat&aacute;,
do this thoughtless deed?&rdquo; When Garu&#7693;a heard this, he was
grieved, and he said, &ldquo;What! Have I in my delusion eaten an
incarnation of a Bodhisattva? This is that very
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who sacrifices his life for others,
the renown of whose glory pervades all these three worlds? So, now that
he is dead, the time has arrived for my wicked self to enter the fire.
Does the fruit of the poison-tree of unrighteousness ever ripen
sweet?&rdquo; While Garu&#7693;a was distracted with these reflections,
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, having beheld his family, fell down
in the agony of his wounds, and died.</p>
<p>Then his parents, tortured with sorrow, lamented, and
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a again and again blamed his own
negligence. But J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s wife,
Malayavat&iacute;, looked towards the heaven, and in accents choked
with tears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>thus reproached the goddess Ambik&aacute;, who
before was pleased with her, and granted her a boon, &ldquo;At that
time, O goddess Gaur&iacute;, thou didst promise me that I should have
for husband one destined to be paramount sovereign over all the kings
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, so how comes it that thou hast now falsified
thy promise to me?&rdquo; When she said this, Gaur&iacute; became
visible, and saying &ldquo;Daughter, my speech was not false,&rdquo;
she quickly sprinkled J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana with nectar
from her pitcher.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9759src" href="#xd27e9759"
name="xd27e9759src">12</a> That made the successful hero
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana at once rise up more splendid than
before, with all his limbs free from wounds.</p>
<p>He rose up, and prostrated himself before the goddess, and then all
prostrated themselves, and the goddess said to him, &ldquo;My son, I am
pleased with this sacrifice of thy body, so I now anoint thee with this
hand of mine emperor over the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and thou shalt hold
the office for a kalpa.&rdquo; With these words Gaur&iacute; sprinkled
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana with water from her pitcher, and
after she had been worshipped, disappeared. And thereupon a heavenly
rain of flowers fell on that spot, and the drums of the gods sounded
joyously in the sky.</p>
<p>Then Garu&#7693;a, bending low, said to
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, &ldquo;Emperor, I am pleased with
thee, as thou art an unparalleled hero, since thou, of soul matchlessly
generous, hast done this wonderful deed, that excites the astonishment
of the three worlds, and is inscribed on the walls of the egg of
Brahm&aacute;. So give me an order, and receive from me whatever boon
thou dost desire.&rdquo; When Garu&#7693;a said this, the great-hearted
hero said to him, &ldquo;Thou must repent, and never again devour the
snakes; and let these snakes, whom thou didst devour before, whose
bones only remain, return to life.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Thereupon Garu&#7693;a said, &ldquo;So
be it; from this day forth I will never eat the snakes again; heaven
forefend! As for those that I ate on former occasions, let them return
to life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all the snakes, that he had eaten before, whose bones alone
remained, rose up unwounded, restored to life by the nectar of his
boon. Then the gods, the snakes, and the hermit bands assembled there
full of joy, and so the Malaya mountain earned the title of the three
worlds. And then all the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas heard by the
favour of Gaur&iacute; the strange story of
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana; and they immediately came and bowed
at his feet, and after he had dismissed Garu&#7693;a, they took him to
the Him&aacute;layas, accompanied by his rejoicing relations and
friends, a noble emperor whose great inauguration ceremony had been
performed by Gaur&iacute; with her own hands. There
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, in the society of his mother and
father, and of Mitr&aacute;vasu and Malayavat&iacute;, and of
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a, who had gone to his own house, and
returned again, long enjoyed the dignity of emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, rich in jewels, which had been gained by his

<p>Having told this very noble and interesting tale, the Vet&aacute;la
proceeded to put another question to king Trivikramasena, &ldquo;So
tell me, which of those two was superior in fortitude,
&#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a or J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana? And
the conditions are those which I mentioned before.&rdquo; When king
Trivikramasena heard this question of the Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s, he
broke his silence, through fear of a curse, and said with calm
composure, &ldquo;This behaviour was nowise astonishing in
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, as he had acquired this virtue in
many births; but &#346;ankhach&uacute;&#7693;a really deserves praise,
for that, after he had escaped death, he ran after his enemy
Garu&#7693;a, who had found another self-offered victim<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9782src" href="#xd27e9782" name=
"xd27e9782src">13</a> and had gone a long distance with him, and
importunately offered him his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that excellent Vet&aacute;la had heard this speech of that
king&rsquo;s, he left his shoulder and again went to his own place, and
the king again pursued him as before.</p>

<p class="first">Oesterley remarks that the substance of this story is
told, in the eleventh chapter of the Vikra macharitam, of king
Vikram&aacute;ditya. A R&aacute;kshasa carried off so many persons from
the city of Pala that the inhabitants agreed to give him one human
being every day. The king takes the place of one of these victims, and
the R&aacute;kshasa is so much affected by it, that he promises not to
demand any more victims. A similar contest in generosity is found in
the 2nd Tale of the Siddhi-k&uuml;r, J&uuml;lg, p. 60, but the end of
the story is quite different. (Oesterley&rsquo;s Bait&aacute;l
Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pp. 205&ndash;207.) The story in the
Siddhi-k&uuml;r is probably the 5th Tale in Sagas from the Far East;
&ldquo;How the Serpent-gods were propitiated.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a city of the name<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9815src" href="#xd27e9815" name="xd27e9815src">2</a> of
Kanakapura situated on the bank of the Ganges, in which the bounds of
virtue were never transgressed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319"
href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>and which was inaccessible to
the demon Kali. In it there was a king rightly named Ya&#347;odhana,
who, like a rocky coast, protected the earth against the sea of
calamity. When Destiny framed him, she seemed to blend together the
moon and the sun, for, though he delighted the world, the heat of his
valour was scorching, and the circle of his territory never waned. This
king was unskilled<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9826src" href=
"#xd27e9826" name="xd27e9826src">3</a> in slandering his neighbour, but
skilled in the meaning of the &#346;&aacute;stras, he shewed poverty in
crime, not in treasure and military force. His subjects sang of him as
one afraid only of sin, covetous only of glory, averse to the wives of
others, all compact of valour, generosity, and love.</p>
<p>In that capital of that sovereign there was a great merchant, and he
had an unmarried daughter, named <span class="corr" id="xd27e9837"
title="Source: Unmadin&iacute;">Unm&aacute;din&iacute;</span>. Whoever
there beheld her, was at once driven mad by the wealth of her beauty,
which was enough to bewilder even the god of love himself. And when she
attained womanhood, her politic father, the merchant, went to king
Ya&#347;odhana, and said to him, &ldquo;King, I have a daughter to give
in marriage, who is the pearl of the three worlds; I dare not give her
away to any one else, without informing your Majesty. For to your
Majesty belong all the jewels of the whole earth, so do me the favour
of accepting or rejecting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this report from the merchant, he sent off, with
due politeness, his own Br&aacute;hmans, to see whether she had
auspicious marks or not. The Br&aacute;hmans went and saw that
matchless beauty of the three worlds, and were at once troubled and
amazed, but when they had recovered their self-control, they reflected;
&ldquo;If the king gets hold of this maiden the kingdom is ruined, for
his mind will be thrown off its balance by her, and he will not regard
his kingdom, so we must not tell the king that she possesses auspicious
marks.&rdquo; When they had deliberated to this effect,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9842src" href="#xd27e9842" name="xd27e9842src">4</a>
they went to the king, and said falsely to him, &ldquo;She has
inauspicious marks.&rdquo; Accordingly the king declined to take that
merchant&rsquo;s daughter as his wife.</p>
<p>Then, by the king&rsquo;s orders, the merchant, the father of the
maiden Unm&aacute;din&iacute;, gave her in marriage to the commander of
the king&rsquo;s forces, named Baladhara. And she lived happily with
her husband in his house, but she thought that she had been dishonoured
by the king&rsquo;s abandoning her on account of her supposed
inauspicious marks.</p>
<p>And as time went on, the lion of spring came to that place, slaying
the elephant of winter, that, with flowering jasmine-creepers for
tusks, had ravaged the thick-clustering lotuses. And it sported in the
wood, with luxuriant clusters of flowers for mane, and with mango-buds
for claws. At that season king Ya&#347;odhana, mounted on an elephant,
went out to see the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320"
name="pb320">320</a>]</span>high festival of spring in that city of
his. And then a warning drum was beaten, to give notice to all matrons
to retire, as it was apprehended that the sight of his beauty might
prove their ruin.</p>
<p>When Unm&aacute;din&iacute; heard that drum, she shewed herself to
the king on the roof of her palace, to revenge the insult he had
offered her by refusing her. And when the king saw her, looking like a
flame shooting up from the fire of love, when fanned by spring and the
winds from the Malaya mountain, he was sorely troubled. And gazing on
her beauty, that pierced deep into his heart, like a victorious dart of
Cupid, he immediately swooned. His servants managed to bring him round,
and when he had entered his palace, he found out from them, by
questioning them, that this was the very beauty who had been formerly
offered to him, and whom he had rejected. Then the king banished from
his realm those who reported that she had inauspicious marks, and
thought on her with longing, night after night, saying to himself,
&ldquo;Ah! how dull of soul and shameless is the moon, that he
continues to rise, while her spotless face is there, a feast to the
eyes of the world!&rdquo; Thinking thus in his heart, the king, being
slowly wasted by the smouldering fires of love, pined away day by day.
But through shame he concealed the cause of his grief, and with
difficulty was he induced to tell it to his confidential servants, who
were led by external signs to question him. Then they said; &ldquo;Why
fret yourself? Why do you not take her to yourself, as she is at your
command?&rdquo; But the righteous sovereign would not consent to follow
their advice.</p>
<p>Then Baladhara, the commander-in-chief, heard the tidings, and being
truly devoted to him, he came and flung himself at the feet of his
sovereign, and made the following petition to him, &ldquo;King, you
should look upon this female slave as your slave-girl, not as the wife
of another; and I bestow her freely upon you, so deign to accept my
wife. Or I will abandon her in the temple here, then, king, there will
be no sin in your taking her to yourself, as there might be, if she
were a matron.&rdquo; When the commander-in-chief persistently
entreated the king to this effect, the king answered him with inward
wrath, &ldquo;How could I, being a king, do such an unrighteous deed?
If I desert the path of right, who will remain loyal to his duty? And
how can you, though devoted to me, urge me to commit a crime, which
will bring momentary pleasure,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9861src"
href="#xd27e9861" name="xd27e9861src">5</a> but cause great misery in
the next world? And if you desert your lawful wife, I shall not allow
your crime to go unpunished, for who in my position could tolerate such
an outrage on morality? So death is for me the best course.&rdquo; With
these words the king vetoed the proposal of the commander-in-chief, for
men of noble character lose their lives sooner than abandon the path of
virtue. And in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>the same way the resolute-minded monarch
rejected the petition of his citizens, and of the country-people, who
assembled, and entreated him to the same effect.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the king&rsquo;s body was gradually consumed by the
fire of the grievous fever of love, and only his name and fame
remained.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9873src" href="#xd27e9873" name=
"xd27e9873src">6</a> But the commander-in-chief could not bear the
thought that the king&rsquo;s death had been brought about in this way,
so he entered the fire; for the actions of devoted followers are
inexplicable.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9893src" href="#xd27e9893"
name="xd27e9893src">7</a></p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, sitting on the shoulder of king
Trivikramasena, had told this wonderful tale, he again said to him,
&ldquo;So tell me, king, which of these two was superior in loyalty,
the general or the king; and remember, the previous condition still
holds.&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la said this, the king broke silence,
and answered him, &ldquo;Of these two the king was superior in
loyalty.&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la heard this, he said to him
reproachfully, &ldquo;Tell me, king, how can you make out that the
general was not his superior? For, though he knew the charm of his
wife&rsquo;s society by long familiarity, he offered such a fascinating
woman to the king out of love for him; and when the king was dead, he
burnt himself; but the king refused the offer of his wife without
knowing anything about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la said this to the king, the latter laughed,
and said, &ldquo;Admitting the truth of this, what is there astonishing
in the fact, that the commander-in-chief, a man of good family, acted
thus for his master&rsquo;s sake, out of regard for him? For servants
are bound to preserve their masters even by the sacrifice of their
lives. But kings are inflated with arrogance, uncontrollable as
elephants, and when bent on enjoyment, they snap asunder the chain of
the moral law. For their minds are overweening, and all discernment is
washed out of them, when the waters of inauguration are poured over
them, and is, as it were, swept away by the flood. And the breeze of
the waving chowries fans away the atoms of the sense of scripture
taught them by old men, as it fans away flies and mosquitoes. And the
royal umbrella keeps off from them the rays of truth, as well as the
rays of the sun; and their eyes, smitten by the gale of prosperity, do
not see the right path. And so even kings, that have conquered the
world, like Nahusha and others, have had their minds bewildered by
M&aacute;ra, and have been brought into calamity. But this king, though
his umbrella was paramount in the earth, was not fascinated by
Unm&aacute;din&iacute;, fickle as the goddess of Fortune; indeed,
sooner than set his foot on the wrong path, he renounced life
altogether; therefore him I consider the more self-controlled of the
two.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s, he
again rapidly quitted his shoulder by the might of his delusive power,
and returned to his own place; and the king followed him swiftly, as
before, to recover him: for how can great men leave off in the middle
of an enterprise, which they have begun, even though it be very
difficult?</p>

<p class="first">Oesterley states that this tale is No. 26, in the
Persian T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah, in Iken, p. 109. The
deliberations about carrying off the wife of the commander-in-chief
are, in this form of the story, carried on in the presence of the
counsellors only; and the king is the only one that dies. From the
Persian T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah the story has passed in a very
similar form into the Turkish T&uacute;t&iacute;n&aacute;mah. Compare
Malesp&iacute;n&iacute;, 1, No. 102, (Oesterley&rsquo;s Bait&aacute;l
Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, pp. 207, 208.) The story, as told by
&#346;ivad&aacute;sa, will be found in Bezzenberger&rsquo;s <span lang=
"de">Beitr&auml;ge zur Kunde der Indo-germanischen Sprachen</span>,
Vol. IV, p. 360<span class="corr" title="Source: ,">.</span> Dr.
Zachari&aelig;, the author of the paper, gives a reference to the
Rajatarangin&iacute;, IV, 17&ndash;37, which Professor B&uuml;hler
pointed out to him. He tells us that the story is the 14th in
Jambhaladatta&rsquo;s recension. The story is also found in the
parables of Buddhaghosha; in a form based upon the
Ummadant&iacute;j&aacute;taka. Dr. Zachari&aelig; gives the Pali text
of this J&aacute;taka in an Appendix, and the corresponding Sanskrit
version of the tale from the J&aacute;takam&aacute;l&aacute; of
Arya&#347;&uacute;ra. He also refers his readers to Upham&rsquo;s
Mah&aacute;vanso, pp. 212&ndash;213; Beal, Texts from the Buddhist
canon, commonly known as Dhammapada, Section XXIII, Advantageous
Service; Bigandet, The life or legend of Gaudama, the Buddha of the
Burmese, pp. 220&ndash;221; and Mary Summer, <span lang="fr">Histoire
du Bouddha S&aacute;kya-Mouni</span>, (Paris, 1874,) p. 145.</p>
<p>In the Pali version the Br&aacute;hmans are so bewildered at the
sight of the girl that they cannot eat, but put their rice on their
heads &amp;c. instead of putting it in their mouths; so she has them
driven out by her servants. Out of revenge they tell the king that she
is a <i lang="sa-latn">k&aacute;laka&#7751;&#7751;i</i>, which
according to Childers means &ldquo;a hag.&rdquo; In the
J&aacute;takam&aacute;l&aacute; they are too much bewildered to stand,
much less to eat; but the report which they make is much the same as in
our text, and made from the same motives.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then in that cemetery, full of the flames of funeral
pyres, as of demons, flesh-devouring, with lolling tongues of fire, the
undaunted king Trivikramasena went back that same night to the <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree.</p>
<p>And there he unexpectedly saw many corpses of similar appearance
hanging upon the tree, and they all seemed to be possessed by
Vet&aacute;las. The king said to himself, &ldquo;Ah! what is the
meaning of this? Is this deluding Vet&aacute;la doing this now in order
to waste my time? For I do not know <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>which of these many
corpses here I ought to take. If this night shall pass away without my
accomplishing my object, I will enter the fire, I will not put up with
disgrace.&rdquo; But the Vet&aacute;la discovered the king&rsquo;s
intention, and pleased with his courage, he withdrew that delusion.
Then the king beheld only one Vet&aacute;la on the tree in the corpse
of a man, and he took it down, and put it on his shoulder, and once
more started off with it. And as he trudged along, the Vet&aacute;la
again said to him, &ldquo;King, your fortitude is wonderful: so listen
to this my tale.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son who failed to
acquire the magic power.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city called Ujjayin&iacute;, inferior only
to Bhogavat&iacute; and Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;, which &#346;iva, who
was won by the toilsome asceticism of Gaur&iacute;, being in love with
the matchless pre-eminence of its excellence, himself selected as his
habitation. It is full of various enjoyments, to be attained only by
distinguished well-doing; in that city stiffness and hardness is seen
only in the bosoms of the ladies, curvature only in their
eye-brows,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9942src" href="#xd27e9942" name=
"xd27e9942src">1</a> and fickleness only in their rolling eyes;
darkness only in the nights; crookedness only in the ambiguous phrases
of poets; madness only in elephants; and coldness only in pearls,
sandal-wood juice, and the moon.</p>
<p>In that city there was a learned Br&aacute;hman, named
Devasv&aacute;min, who had offered many sacrifices, and possessed great
wealth, and who was highly honoured by the king, whose name was
Chandraprabha. In time there was born to that Br&aacute;hman a son,
named Chandrasv&aacute;min, and he, though he had studied the sciences,
was, when he grew up, exclusively devoted to the vice of
gambling.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9949src" href="#xd27e9949" name=
"xd27e9949src">2</a> Now once on a time that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s
son, Chandrasv&aacute;min, entered a great gambling-hall to gamble.
Calamities seemed to be continually watching that hall with tumbling
dice for rolling eyes, like the black antelope in colour, and saying to
themselves, &ldquo;Whom shall we seize on here?&rdquo; And the hall,
full of the noise of the altercations of gamblers, seemed to utter this
cry, &ldquo;Who is there whose wealth I could not take away? I could
impoverish even Kuvera the lord of Alak&aacute;.&rdquo; Then he entered
the hall, and playing dice with gamblers, he lost his clothes and all,
and then he lost borrowed money in addition. And when he was called
upon to pay that impossible sum, he could not do it, so the keeper of
the gambling-hall seized him and beat him with sticks.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9955src" href="#xd27e9955" name="xd27e9955src">3</a>
And that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son, when beaten with sticks all over
his body, made himself motionless as a stone, and to all appearance
dead, and remained in that state. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324"
href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he had remained there in that condition for two or three days,
the proprietor of the gambling establishment got angry, and said, in
the gambling-hall, to the gamblers, who frequented it; &ldquo;This
fellow has begun to try on the petrifaction dodge, so take the
spiritless wretch and throw him into some blind well; but I will give
you the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the proprietor said this to the gamblers, they took up
Chandrasv&aacute;min, and carried him to a distant wood to look for a
well. There an old gambler said to the others, &ldquo;This fellow is
all but dead; so what is the good of throwing him into a well now? So
let us leave him here, and say that we left him in a well.&rdquo; All
approved his speech, and agreed to do as he recommended.</p>
<p>Then the gamblers left Chandrasv&aacute;min there and went their
ways, and he rose up and entered an empty temple of &#346;iva that
stood near. There he recovered his strength a little, and reflected in
his grief, &ldquo;Alas! being over-confiding, I have been robbed by
these gamblers by downright cheating, so, where can I go in this
condition, naked, cudgelled, and begrimed with dust? What would my
father, my relations, or my friends say of me, if they saw me? So I
will remain here for the present, and at night I will go out, and see
how I can make shift to get food, to satisfy my hunger.&rdquo; While he
was going through these reflections in hunger and nakedness, the sun
abated his heat, and abandoned his garment the sky, and went to the
mountain of setting.</p>
<p>Thereupon there came there a P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic with his
body smeared with ashes, with matted hair and a trident, looking like a
second &#346;iva. When he saw Chandrasv&aacute;min, he said to him,
&ldquo;Who are you?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Thereupon Chandrasv&aacute;min told him
his story, and bowed before him, and the hermit when he heard it, said
to him; &ldquo;You have arrived at my hermitage, as an unexpected
guest, exhausted with hunger; so rise up, bathe, and take a portion of
the food I have obtained by begging.&rdquo; When the hermit said this
to Chandrasv&aacute;min, he answered, &ldquo;Reverend sir, I am a
Br&aacute;hman; how can I eat a part of your alms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hospitable hermit who possessed magic powers, heard that,
he entered his hut, and called to mind the science which produces
whatever one desires, and the science appeared to him when he called it
to mind, and said, &ldquo;What shall I do for you?&rdquo; And he gave
it this order; &ldquo;Provide entertainment for this guest.&rdquo; The
science answered &ldquo;I will;&rdquo; and then Chandrasv&aacute;min
beheld a golden city rise up, with a garden attached to it, and full of
female attendants. And those females came out of that city, and
approached the astonished Chandrasv&aacute;min, and said to him;
&ldquo;Rise up, good sir; come, eat, and forget your fatigue.&rdquo;
Then they took him inside, and made him bathe, and anointed him; and
they put splendid garments on him, and took him to another magnificent
dwelling; and there the young man beheld <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>a young woman who
seemed their chief, who was beautiful in all her limbs, and appeared to
have been made by the Creator out of curiosity to see what he could do.
She rose up, eager to welcome him, and made him sit beside her on her
throne, and he partook with her of heavenly food, and ate with much
delight betel-nut, flavoured with five fruits.</p>
<p>And next morning he woke up, and saw only that temple of &#346;iva
there, and neither that city, nor that heavenly lady nor her
attendants. Then the hermit came out of the hut smiling, and asked him
how he had enjoyed himself in the night, and the discreet
Chandrasv&aacute;min, in his despondency, said to the hermit, &ldquo;By
your favour, reverend sir, I spent the night happily enough; but now,
without that heavenly lady, my life will depart.&rdquo; When the hermit
heard that, being kind-hearted, he laughed and said to him,
&ldquo;Remain here, you shall have exactly the same experiences this
night also.&rdquo; When the hermit said this, Chandrasv&aacute;min
consented to stay, and by the favour of the hermit, he was provided by
the same means with the same enjoyments every night.</p>
<p>And at last he understood that this was all produced by magic
science, so, one day, impelled by destiny, he coaxed that mighty hermit
and said to him, &ldquo;If, reverend sir, you really take pity on me,
who have fled to you for protection, bestow on me that science, whose
power is so great.&rdquo; When he urged this request persistently, the
hermit said to him, &ldquo;You cannot attain this science; for it is
attained under the water, and while the aspirant is muttering spells
under the water, the science creates delusions to bewilder him, so that
he does not attain success. For there he sees himself born again, and a
boy, and then a youth, and then a young man, and married, and then he
supposes that he has a son. And he is falsely deluded, supposing that
one person is his friend and another his enemy, and he does not
remember this birth, nor that he is engaged in a magic rite for
acquiring science. But whoever, when he seems to have reached
<span class="corr" id="xd27e9981" title=
"Source: twentyfour">twenty-four</span> years, is recalled to
consciousness by the science of his instructor, and being firm of soul,
remembers his real life, and knows that all he supposes himself to
experience is the effect of illusion, and though he is under the
influence of it, enters the fire, attains the science, and rising from
the water, sees the real truth. But if the science is not attained by
the pupil on whom it is bestowed, it is lost to the teacher also, on
account of its having been communicated to an unfit person. You can
attain all the results you desire by my possession of the science; why
do you shew this persistence? Take care that my power is not lost, and
that so your enjoyment is not lost also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the hermit said this, Chandrasv&aacute;min persisted in
saying to him, <span class="corr" id="xd27e9986" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>I shall be able to do all that is
required<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9989src" href="#xd27e9989" name=
"xd27e9989src">4</a>; do not be anxious about that.&rdquo; Then the
hermit consented to give him the science. What will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>not
good men do for the sake of those that implore their aid? Then the
P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic went to the bank of the river, and said to
him, &ldquo;My son, when, in repeating this charm, you behold that
illusion, I will recall you to consciousness by my magic power, and you
must enter the fire which you will see in your illusion. For I shall
remain here all the time on the bank of the river to help you. When
that prince of ascetics had said this, being himself pure, he duly
communicated that charm to Chandrasv&aacute;min, who was purified and
had rinsed his mouth with water. Then Chandrasv&aacute;min bowed low
before his teacher, and plunged boldly into the river, while he
remained on the bank. And while he was repeating over that charm in the
water, he was at once bewildered by its deluding power, and cheated
into forgetting the whole of that birth. And he imagined himself to be
born in his own person in another town, as the son of a certain
Br&aacute;hman, and he slowly grew up. And in his fancy he was invested
with the Br&aacute;hmanical thread, and studied the prescribed
sciences, and married a wife, and was absorbed in the joys and sorrows
of married life, and in course of time had a son born to him, and he
remained in that town engaged in various pursuits, enslaved by love for
his son, devoted to his wife, with his parents and relations.</p>
<p>While he was thus living through in his fancy a life other than his
real one, the hermit his teacher employed the charm, whose office it
was to rouse him at the proper season. He was suddenly awakened from
his reverie by the employment of that charm, and recollected himself
and that hermit, and became aware that all that he was apparently going
through was magic illusion, and he became eager to enter the fire, in
order to gain the fruit, which was to be attained by the charm; but he
was surrounded by his elders, friends, superiors and relations, who all
tried to prevent him. Still, though they used all kinds of arguments to
dissuade him, being desirous of heavenly enjoyment, he went with his
relations to the bank of the river, on which a pyre was prepared. There
he saw his aged parents and his wife ready to die with grief, and his
young children crying; and in his bewilderment he said to himself;
&ldquo;Alas! my relations will all die, if I enter the fire, and I do
not know if that promise of my teacher&rsquo;s is true or not. So shall
I enter the fire? Or shall I not enter it? After all, how can that
promise of my teacher&rsquo;s be false, as it is so precisely in
accordance with all that has taken place? So, I will gladly enter the
fire.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman Chandrasv&aacute;min had gone
through these reflections, he entered the fire.</p>
<p>And to his astonishment the fire felt as cool to him as snow. Then
he rose up from the water of the river, the delusion having come to an
end, and went to the bank. There he saw his teacher on the bank, and he
prostrated himself at his feet, and when his teacher questioned him, he
told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>him all his experiences, ending with the cool
feel of the fire. Then his teacher said to him, &ldquo;My son, I am
afraid you have made some mistake in this incantation, otherwise how
can the fire have become cool to you? This phenomenon in the process of
acquiring this science is unprecedented.&rdquo; When
Chandrasv&aacute;min heard this remark of his teacher&rsquo;s, he
answered, &ldquo;Reverend sir, I am sure that I made no
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the teacher, in order to know for certain, called to mind that
science, and it did not present itself to him or his pupil. So, as both
of them had lost the science, they left that place despondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story, he once more put
a question to king Trivikramasena, after mentioning the same condition
as before; &ldquo;King, resolve this doubt of mine; tell me, why was
the science lost to both of them, though the incantation was performed
in the prescribed way?&rdquo; When the brave king heard this speech of
the Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s, he gave him this answer; &ldquo;I know, lord
of magic, you are bent on wasting my time here, still I will answer. A
man cannot obtain success even by performing correctly a difficult
ceremony, unless his mind is firm, and abides in spotless courage,
unhesitating and pure from wavering. But in that business the mind of
that spiritless young Br&aacute;hman wavered, even when roused by his
teacher,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10008src" href="#xd27e10008" name=
"xd27e10008src">5</a> so his charm did not attain success, and his
teacher lost his mastery over the charm, because he had bestowed it on
an undeserving aspirant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, the mighty Vet&aacute;la again left his
shoulder and went back invisible to his own place, and the king went
back to fetch him as before.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The above story closely resembles one quoted from the
Turkish Tales in the 94th number of the Spectator.</p>
<p>A sultan of Egypt was directed by a great doctor in the law, who had
the gift of working miracles, to place himself in a huge tub of water,
which he accordingly did; and as he stood by the tub amidst a circle of
his great men, the holy man bid him plunge his head into the water and
draw it up again. The king accordingly thrust his head into the water,
and at the same time found himself at the foot of a mountain on the
sea-shore. The king immediately began to rage against his doctor for
this piece of treachery and witchcraft; but at length, knowing it was
in vain to be angry, he set himself to think on proper methods for
getting a livelihood in this strange country<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Accordingly he applied himself to some people,
whom he saw at work in a neighbouring wood: these people conducted him
to a town that stood at a little distance from the wood, where after
some adventures, he married a woman of great beauty and fortune. He
lived with this woman so long that he had by her seven sons and seven
daughters. He was afterwards reduced to great want, and forced to think
of plying in the streets as a porter for his livelihood. One day, as he
was walking alone by the seaside, being seized with many melancholy
reflections upon his former and his present state of life<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e10028" title="Source: .">,</span> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>which had raised a fit of devotion in him, he
threw off his clothes in the desire to wash himself, according to the
custom of the Muhammadans, before he said his prayers.</p>
<p>After his first plunge into the sea, he no sooner raised his head
above the water, than he found himself standing by the side of the tub,
with the great men of his court about him, and the holy man at his
side. He immediately upbraided his teacher for having sent him on such
a course of adventures, and betrayed him into so long a state of misery
and servitude; but was wonderfully surprised when he heard that the
state he talked of was only a dream and a delusion; that he had not
stirred from the place where he then stood; and that he had only dipped
his head into the water, and taken it out again. Oesterley compares the
story of Devadatta in the 26th Taranga of this work.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Thief&rsquo;s Son.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city named Vakrolaka, equal to the city of
the gods; in it there dwelt a king named S&uacute;ryaprabha, equal to
Indra. He, like Vish&#7751;u, rescued this earth, and bore it long time
on his arm, gladdening all men by his frame ever ready to bear their
burdens.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10050src" href="#xd27e10050" name=
"xd27e10050src">1</a> In the realm of that king tears were produced
only by contact with smoke, there was no talk of death except in the
case of the living death of starved lovers, and the only fines were the
fine gold sticks in the hands of his warders. He was rich in all manner
of wealth, and he had only one source of grief, namely, that, though he
had many wives, no son was born to him.</p>
<p>Now, at this point of the story, there was a merchant, of the name
of Dhanap&aacute;la, in the great city of T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, the
wealthiest of the wealthy. And he had born to him one daughter only,
and her name was Dhanavat&iacute;, who was shewn by her beauty to be a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; fallen by a curse. When she grew up to
womanhood, the merchant died; and his relations seized his property, as
the king did not interfere to protect it. Then the wife of that
merchant, who was named Hira&#7751;yavat&iacute;, took her own jewels
and ornaments, which she had carefully concealed, and left her house
secretly at the beginning of night, with her daughter Dhanavat&iacute;,
and fled, to escape <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"
name="pb329">329</a>]</span>from her husband&rsquo;s relations. And
with difficulty did she get outside the town, leaning upon the hand of
her daughter, for without her was the darkness of night, and within her
the darkness of grief. And as she went along in the thick darkness
outside the town, it chanced, so fate would have it, that she ran her
shoulder against a thief impaled on a stake, whom she did not see. He
was still alive, and his pain being aggravated by the blow he received
from her shoulder, he said, &ldquo;Alas! who has rubbed salt into my
wounds?&rdquo; The merchant&rsquo;s wife then and there said to him,
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He answered her, &ldquo;I am a detected
thief impaled here,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10057src" href=
"#xd27e10057" name="xd27e10057src">2</a> and though I am impaled, my
breath has not yet left my body, wicked man that I am. So tell me,
lady, who you are and whither you are going in this manner.&rdquo; When
the merchant&rsquo;s wife heard this, she told him her story; and at
that moment the eastern quarter adorned her face with the outshining
moon, as with a beauty-patch.</p>
<p>Then, all the horizon being lighted up, the thief saw the
merchant&rsquo;s daughter, the maiden Dhanavat&iacute;, and said to her
mother, &ldquo;Listen to one request of mine; I will give you a
thousand pieces of gold; come, give me this maiden daughter of yours to
wife.&rdquo; She laughed, and said, &ldquo;What do you want with
her?&rdquo; Then the thief replied, &ldquo;I am now as good as dead,
and I have no son; and you know, a sonless man does not inherit the
worlds of bliss. But, if you agree to my proposal, whatever son she may
give birth to by my appointment, whoever may be his father, will be the
issue raised up to me. This is the reason why I ask for her, but do you
accomplish that desire of mine.&rdquo; When the merchant&rsquo;s widow
heard this, she consented to it out of avarice. And she brought water
from somewhere or other, and poured it on the hand of that thief, and
said, &ldquo;I give you this my maiden daughter in marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then gave to her daughter the command aforesaid, and then said to
the merchant&rsquo;s widow, &ldquo;Go and dig at the foot of this
banyan-tree, and take the gold you find there; and when I am dead, have
my body burnt with the usual ceremonies, and throw my bones into some
sacred water, and go with your daughter to the city of Vakrolaka. There
the people are made happy by good government under king
S&uacute;ryaprabha, and you will be able to live as you like, free from
anxiety, as you will not be persecuted.&rdquo; When the thief had said
this, being thirsty, he drank some water which she brought; and his
life came to an end, spent with the torture of impalement.</p>
<p>Then the merchant&rsquo;s widow went and took the gold from the foot
of the banyan-tree, and went secretly with her daughter to the house of
a friend of her husband&rsquo;s; and while she was there, she managed
to get that thief&rsquo;s body duly burnt, and had his bones thrown
into a sacred water, and all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>other rites performed. And
the next day she took that concealed wealth, and went off with her
daughter, and travelling along reached in course of time that city
Vakrolaka. There she bought a house from a great merchant named
Vasudatta, and lived in it with her daughter Dhanavat&iacute;.</p>
<p>Now at that time there lived in that city a teacher of the name of
Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min. And he had a pupil, a very handsome
Br&aacute;hman of the name of Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min. And he, though
he was of high birth and well-educated, was so enslaved by the passions
of youth that he fell in love with a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> of the name of
Hans&aacute;val&iacute;. But she demanded a fee of five hundred gold
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and he did not possess this sum, so he was
in a state of perpetual despondency.</p>
<p>And one day that merchant&rsquo;s daughter Dhanavat&iacute; saw him
from the top of her palace, such as I have described, with attenuated
but handsome frame. Her heart was captivated by his beauty; so she
called to mind the injunction of that thief her husband, and artfully
said to her mother, who was near her; &ldquo;Mother, behold the beauty
and youth of this young Br&aacute;hman, how charming they are, raining
nectar into the eyes of the whole world.&rdquo; When that
merchant&rsquo;s widow heard this, she saw that her daughter was in
love with the young Br&aacute;hman, and she thought thus in her mind;
&ldquo;My daughter is bound by the orders of her husband to choose some
man, in order to raise up issue to her husband, so why should she not
invite this one?&rdquo; When she had gone through these reflections,
she entrusted her wish to a confidential maid, and sent her to bring
the Br&aacute;hman for her daughter.</p>
<p>The maid went and took that Br&aacute;hman aside, and communicated
her mistress&rsquo;s wish to him, and that young and dissolute
Br&aacute;hman said to her; &ldquo;If they will give me five hundred
gold d&iacute;n&aacute;rs for Hans&aacute;val&iacute;, I will go there
for one night.&rdquo; When he said this to the maid, she went and
communicated it to the merchant&rsquo;s widow, and she sent the money
to him by her hand. When Manah&#803;sv&aacute;min had received the
money, he went with the maid to the private apartments of the
widow&rsquo;s daughter, Dhanavat&iacute;, who had been made over to
him. Then he saw that expectant fair one, the ornament of the earth, as
the partridge beholds the moonlight, and rejoiced; and after passing
the night there, he went away secretly next morning.</p>
<p>And Dhanavat&iacute;, the merchant&rsquo;s daughter, became pregnant
by him, and in due time she brought forth a son, whose auspicious marks
foreshadowed his lofty destiny. She and her mother were much pleased at
the birth of a son; and then &#346;iva manifested himself to them in a
dream by night, and said to them; &ldquo;Take this boy, as he lies in
his cradle, and leave him, with a thousand gold pieces, early in the
morning, at the door of king S&uacute;ryaprabha. In this way all will
turn out well.&rdquo; The merchant&rsquo;s widow and the
merchant&rsquo;s daughter, having received this command from &#346;iva,
woke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>up, and told one another their dream. And
relying upon the god, they took the boy and the gold, and laid them
together at the gate of king S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s
palace.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10087src" href="#xd27e10087" name=
"xd27e10087src">3</a></p>
<p>In the meanwhile &#346;iva thus commanded in a dream king
S&uacute;ryaprabha, who was tormented with anxiety to obtain a son;
&ldquo;Rise up, king, somebody has placed at the gate of your palace a
handsome child and some gold, take him as he lies in his cradle.&rdquo;
When &#346;iva had said this to the king, he woke up in the morning,
and at that moment the warders came in and told him the same, and so he
went out himself, and seeing at the gate of the palace that boy with a
heap of gold, and observing that he was of auspicious appearance,
having his hands and feet marked with the line, the umbrella, the
banner and other marks, he said, &ldquo;&#346;iva has given me a
suitable child,&rdquo; and he himself took him up in his arms, and went
into the palace with him. And he made a feast, and gave away an
incalculable amount of wealth, so that only the word &ldquo;poor&rdquo;
was without its proper wealth of signification. And king
S&uacute;ryaprabha spent twelve days in music, and dancing, and other
amusements, and then he gave that son the name of Chandraprabha.</p>
<p>And gradually prince Chandraprabha increased in stature as well as
in excellent character, delighting his dependants by both. And in
course of time he grew up, and became capable of bearing the weight of
the earth, winning over the subjects by his courage, his generosity,
his learning, and other accomplishments. And his father, king
S&uacute;ryaprabha, seeing that he possessed these qualities, appointed
him his successor in the kingdom, and being an old man, and having
accomplished all his ends in life, he went to
V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;. And while that son of his,
distinguished for policy, was ruling the earth, he abandoned his body
at V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;, in the performance of severe
asceticism.</p>
<p>And that pious king Chandraprabha, hearing of the death of his
father, lamented for him, and performed the usual ceremonies, and then
said to his ministers, &ldquo;How can I ever pay my debt to my father?
However I will make one recompense to him with my own hand. I will take
his bones and duly fling them into the Ganges, and I will go to
Gay&aacute;, and offer an obsequial cake to all the ancestors, and I
will diligently perform a pilgrimage to all sacred waters, as far as
the eastern sea.&rdquo; When the king said this, his ministers said to
him, &ldquo;Your majesty, kings ought never to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>do
these things, for sovereignty has many weak points, and cannot subsist
a moment without being upheld. So you must pay this debt to your father
by the instrumentality of another. What visiting of holy waters, other
than the doing of your duty, is incumbent upon you? Kings, who are ever
carefully guarded, have nothing to do with pilgrimage, which is exposed
to many dangers.&rdquo; When king Chandraprabha heard this speech of
his ministers&rsquo;, he answered them, &ldquo;Away with doubts and
hesitations! I must certainly go for my father&rsquo;s sake; and I must
visit the sacred waters, while I am young and strong enough. Who knows
what will take place hereafter, for the body perishes in a moment? And
you must guard my kingdom until my return.&rdquo; When the ministers
heard this resolve of the king&rsquo;s, they remained silent. So the
king got ready all the requisites for the journey. Then, on an
auspicious day, the king bathed, made offerings to the fire, gave
complimentary presents to Br&aacute;hmans, and ascended a chariot to
which the horses were yoked, subdued in spirit and wearing the dress of
an ascetic,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10105src" href="#xd27e10105"
name="xd27e10105src">4</a> and started on his pilgrimage. With
difficulty did he induce the feudal chiefs, the R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts,
the citizens, and the country people, who followed him as far as the
frontier, to return, much against their will; and so, throwing the
burden of his realm upon his ministers, king Chandraprabha set out in
the company of his private chaplain, attended by Br&aacute;hmans in
chariots. He was diverted by beholding various garbs, and hearing
various languages, and by the other distractions of travel, and so
seeing on his way all kinds of countries, in course of time he reached
the Ganges. And he gazed upon that river, which seemed with the ridges
of its waves to be making a ladder for mortals to ascend into heaven
by; and which might be said to imitate Ambik&aacute;, since it sprang
from the mountain Himavat, and playfully pulled in its course the hair
of &#346;iva, and was worshipped by the divine &#7770;ishis and the
Ga&#7751;as. So he descended from his chariot, and bathed in that
river, and threw into it in accordance with pious custom the bones of
king S&uacute;ryaprabha.</p>
<p>And after he had given gifts and performed the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i>, he ascended the chariot, and set
out, and in course of time reached Pray&aacute;ga<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10125src" href="#xd27e10125" name="xd27e10125src">5</a>
celebrated by <i lang="sa-latn">&#7771;ishis</i>, where the meeting
streams of the Ganges and Yamun&aacute; gleam for the welfare of men,
like the line of flame and the line of smoke of the sacrificial butter
blending together. There king Chandraprabha fasted, and performed with
various pious actions, such as bathing, distribution of wealth, and so
on, the solemn ceremony of the <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i>, and then he went on to <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e10134" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
which seemed by the silken banners of its temples, tossed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>up
and down by gusts of wind, to cry out from afar, &ldquo;Come and attain
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that city he fasted for three days, and then worshipped &#346;iva
with various meat-offerings, as became his own rank, and then set out
for Gay&aacute;. As he travelled through the woods, the trees, which
were bent down by the weight of their fruit, and in which the birds
were sweetly singing, seemed at every step to be bowing before him and
praising him at the same time; and the winds, throwing about the
woodland flowers, seemed to honour him with posies. And so he crossed
the forest districts and reached the sacred hill of
Gay&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10142src" href="#xd27e10142"
name="xd27e10142src">6</a> And there he duly performed a <i lang=
"sa-latn">&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i>, in which he bestowed many gifts on
Br&aacute;hmans, and then he entered the Holy Wood. And while he was
offering the sacrificial cake to his father in the well of Gay&aacute;,
there rose out of it three human hands to take the cake. When the king
saw this, he was bewildered, and said to his own Br&aacute;hmans;
&ldquo;What does this mean? Into which hand am I to put the
cake?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;King, this hand in which an iron
spike is seen, is certainly the hand of a thief; and this second hand,
which holds a colander,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10160src" href=
"#xd27e10160" name="xd27e10160src">7</a> is the hand of a
Br&aacute;hman; and this third hand, which has the ring and the
auspicious marks, is the hand of a king. So we do not know into which
hand the sacrificial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334"
name="pb334">334</a>]</span>cake is to be put, or what all this
means.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hmans said this to the king, he was
unable to arrive at any certain decision.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, on the shoulder of the king, had told this
wonderful tale, he said to king Trivikramasena, &ldquo;Now into whose
hand should the cake have been put? Let your Highness tell me that; and
remember the previous condition is still binding on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When king Trivikramasena, who was well versed in law, heard this
from the Vet&aacute;la, he broke silence, and answered him; &ldquo;The
sacrificial cake should have been placed in the hand of the thief, for
king Chandraprabha was his son, raised up to him by his appointment,
and he was not the son of either of the other two. For though the
Br&aacute;hman begot him, he cannot be considered his father, as he
sold himself for money for that one night. However he might have been
considered the son of king S&uacute;ryaprabha, because he had the
sacraments performed for him, and brought him up, if the king had not
received his wealth for the purpose. For the gold, which was placed at
the head of the child in the cradle, was the price paid to king
S&uacute;ryaprabha for bringing him up, and other services. Accordingly
king Chandraprabha was the son, begotten by another man, of that thief,
who received his mother with the pouring of water over the hands, who
gave the order for his being begotten, and to whom all that wealth
belonged; and he ought to have placed the sacrificial cake in the
thief&rsquo;s hand; this is my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this, the Vet&aacute;la left his shoulder, and
went to his own place, and king Trivikramasena again went after him to
bring him back.</p>

there is no touching of the thief; Dhanavat&iacute; of her own accord

Literally &ldquo;head of Gay&aacute;.&rdquo; When Gay&aacute;sura was
engaged in devotion on the hill Kol&aacute;hal about 30 miles from
Gay&aacute;, Brahm&aacute; and the other gods came to him, and asked
him what object he had in view. He said his wish was that his body
might become the holiest thing in the world, so that all, who touched
it, might at once obtain salvation. The request was granted. But Yama
complained to Brahm&aacute; that no one now came to hell, so that his
position had become a sinecure. Thereupon Brahm&aacute;, after taking
counsel with the other gods, went to Gay&aacute;sura, and asked him to
give his body for a place on which to perform a sacrifice. He
consented. Then Brahm&aacute; performed his sacrifice on the body of
Gay&aacute;sura, placed several gods on it, and made it immovable. His
body now lies with its head towards the north and its feet towards the
south. It is therefore called Gay&aacute;kshetra. The area of
Gay&aacute;kshetra is ten square miles. The interior part of
Gay&aacute;kshetra, about two square miles in extent, is called
Gay&aacute;&#347;irah&#803; or the head of Gay&aacute;. A more usual
form appears to be Gay&aacute;&#347;irah&#803; the head of the Asura
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10144" title=

Gay&aacute;&#347;irah&#803; is called Gay&aacute;mukha.
&#346;r&aacute;ddhas are performed there. Dharm&aacute;ranya which I
have translated &ldquo;Holy wood&rdquo; is a place in the east of Bodh

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman boy, who offered himself
up to save the life of the king.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city called
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10193src" href=
"#xd27e10193" name="xd27e10193src">1</a> rightly so named, where the
established divisions of the castes never step across the strict line
of demarcation. In it there lived a king, named Chandr&aacute;valoka,
the crest-jewel of kings, who rained showers of nectar into the eyes of
those devoted to him. Wise men praised him as the binding-post of the
elephant of valour, the fountain-head of generosity, and the
pleasure-pavilion of beauty. There was one supreme sorrow in the heart
of that young prince, that, though he enjoyed all kinds of prosperity,
he could not obtain a suitable wife.</p>
<p>Now, one day, the king, accompanied by mounted attendants, went out
to a great forest to hunt, in order to dispel that sorrow. There he
cleft with continual shafts the herds of wild swine, as the sun,
shining in the dun sky,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10200src" href=
"#xd27e10200" name="xd27e10200src">2</a> disperses the darkness with
his rays. Surpassing Arjuna in strength, he made the lions, impetuous
in fight, and terrible with their yellow manes, repose upon beds of
arrows. Like Indra in might, he stripped of their wings<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10203src" href="#xd27e10203" name=
"xd27e10203src">3</a> the mountain-like &#346;arabhas, and laid them
low with the blows of his darts hard as the thunder-bolt. In the ardour
of the chase he felt a longing to penetrate into the centre of the wood
alone, so he urged on his horse with a smart blow of his heel. The
horse, being exceedingly excited by that blow of his heel, and by a
stroke of the whip, cared neither for rough nor smooth, but darting on
with a speed exceeding that of the wind, in a moment traversed ten
<i lang="sa-latn">yojanas</i>, and carried the king, the functions of
whose senses were quite paralysed, to another forest.</p>
<p>There the horse stopped, and the king, having lost his bearings,
roamed about wearied, until he saw near him a broad lake, which seemed
to make signs to him to approach with its lotuses, that, bent down
towards him and then raised again by the wind, seemed like beckoning
hands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10211src" href="#xd27e10211" name=
"xd27e10211src">4</a> So he went up to it, and relieved his horse by
taking off its saddle and letting it roll, and bathed and watered it,
and then tied it up in the shade of a tree, and gave it a heap of
grass. Then he bathed himself, and drank water, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>and
so dispelled his fatigue, and then he let his eye wander hither and
thither in the delightful environs of the lake. And in one part he saw,
at the foot of an <i lang="sa-latn">a&#347;oka</i>-tree, a wonderfully
beautiful hermit&rsquo;s daughter, accompanied by her friend. She wore
garlands of flowers, and a dress of bark, which became her well. And
she looked exceedingly charming on account of the elegant way in which
her hair was plaited together after the hermit fashion. And the king,
who had now fallen within the range of the arrows of love, said to
himself; &ldquo;Who can this be? Can it be S&aacute;vitr&iacute; come
to bathe in the lake? Or can it be Gaur&iacute;, who has slipped away
from the arms of &#346;iva, and again betaken herself to asceticism? Or
can it be the beauty of the moon that has taken upon herself a vow, as
the moon has set, now that it is day? So I had better approach her
quietly and find out.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the king approached
that maiden.</p>
<p>But when she saw him coming, her eyes were bewildered by his beauty,
and her hand relaxed its grasp on the garland of flowers, which she had
before begun to weave, and she said to herself; &ldquo;Who is this that
has found his way into such a wood as this? Is he a Siddha or a
Vidy&aacute;dhara? In truth his beauty might satisfy the eyes of the
whole world.&rdquo; When these thoughts had passed through her mind,
she rose up, and modestly looking askance at him she proceeded to go
away, though her legs seemed to want all power of movement.</p>
<p>Then the polite and dexterous monarch approached her and said,
&ldquo;Fair one, I do not ask you to welcome and entertain a person
seen for the first time, who has come from a distance, and desires no
fruit other than that of beholding you; but how is your running away
from him to be reconciled with the obligations of hermit life?&rdquo;
When the king said this, the lady&rsquo;s attendant, who was equally
dexterous, sat down there, and entertained the king.</p>
<p>Then the eager king said to her with an affectionate manner,
&ldquo;Worthy lady, what auspicious family is adorned by this friend of
yours? What are the ear-nectar-distilling syllables of her name? And
why does she torture in this wilderness, with the discipline
appropriate to ascetics, her body, which is soft as a flower?&rdquo;
When her friend heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s, she answered;
&ldquo;This is the maiden daughter of the great hermit Kanva, born to
him by Menak&aacute;; she has been brought up in the hermitage, and her
name is Ind&iacute;varaprabh&aacute;. She has come here to bathe in
this lake by permission of her father, and her father&rsquo;s hermitage
is at no great distance from this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this to the king, he was delighted, and he mounted his
horse, and set out for the hermitage of the hermit Kanva, with the
intention of asking him for that daughter of his. He left his horse
outside the hermitage, and then he entered with modest humility its
enclosure, which was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"
name="pb337">337</a>]</span>full of hermits with matted hair, and coats
of bark, thus resembling in appearance its trees. And in the middle of
it he saw the hermit Kanva surrounded with hermits, delighting the eye
with his brightness, like the moon surrounded with planets. So he went
up to him, and worshipped him, embracing his feet. The wise hermit
entertained him and dispelled his fatigue, and then lost no time in
saying to him; &ldquo;My son Chandr&aacute;valoka, listen to the good
advice which I am about to give you. You know how all living creatures
in the world fear death: so why do you slay without cause these poor
deer? The Disposer appointed the weapon of the warrior for the
protection of the terrified. So rule your subjects righteously, root up
your enemies, and secure fleeting fortune and her gifts by the warlike
training of horse, and elephant, and so on. Enjoy the delights of rule,
give gifts, diffuse your fame throughout the world, but abandon the
vice of hunting, the cruel sport of death. What is the profit of that
mischievous hunting, in which slayer, victim, and horse<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10229src" href="#xd27e10229" name=
"xd27e10229src">5</a> are all equally beside themselves? Have you have
not heard what happened to P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intelligent king, Chandr&aacute;valoka, heard and accepted
cheerfully this advice of the hermit Kanva, and then answered him,
&ldquo;Reverend Sir, I have been instructed by you; you have done me a
great favour; I renounce hunting, let living creatures be henceforth
free from alarm.&rdquo; When the hermit heard that, he said, &ldquo;I
am pleased with you for thus granting security to living creatures; so
choose whatever boon you desire.&rdquo; When the hermit said this, the
king, who knew his time, said to him, &ldquo;If you are satisfied with
me, then give me your daughter Ind&iacute;varaprabh&aacute;.&rdquo;
When the king made this request, the hermit bestowed on him his
daughter, who had just returned from bathing, born from an Apsaras, a
wife meet for him. Then the wives of the hermits adorned her, and the
marriage was solemnized, and king Chandr&aacute;valoka mounted his
horse and set out thence quickly, taking with him his wife, whom the
ascetics followed as far as the limits of the hermitage with gushing
tears. And as he went along, the sun, seeing that the action of that
day had been prolonged,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10237src" href=
"#xd27e10237" name="xd27e10237src">6</a> sat down, as if wearied, on
the peak of the mountain of setting. And in course of time appeared the
gazelle-eyed nymph of night, overflowing with love, veiling her shape
in a violet robe of darkness.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the king found on the road an <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;vattha</i>-tree, on the bank of a lake, the water of
which was as transparent as a good man&rsquo;s heart. And seeing that
that spot was overshadowed with dense boughs and leaves, and was shady
and grassy, he made up his mind that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>he would pass the
night there. Then he dismounted from his horse, and gave it grass and
water, and rested on the sandy bank of the lake, and drank water, and
cooled himself in the breeze; and then he lay down with that
hermit&rsquo;s daughter, under that tree, on a bed of flowers. And at
that time the moon arose, and removing the mantle of darkness, seized
and kissed the glowing face of the East. And all the quarters of the
heaven were free from darkness, and gleamed, embraced and illuminated
by the rays of the moon, so that there was no room for pride.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10250src" href="#xd27e10250" name=
"xd27e10250src">7</a> And so the beams of the moon entered the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10253" title=
"Source: insterstices">interstices</span> in the bower of creepers, and
lit up the space round the foot of the tree like jewel-lamps.</p>
<p>And the next morning the king left his bed, and after the morning
prayer, he made ready to set out with his wife to rejoin his army. And
then the moon, that had in the night robbed the cheeks of the lotuses
of their beauty, lost its brightness, and slunk, as if in fear, to the
hollows of the western mountain; for the sun, fiery-red with anger, as
if desirous to slay it, lifted his curved sword in his outstretched
fingers.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10258src" href="#xd27e10258" name=
"xd27e10258src">8</a> At that moment there suddenly came there a
Br&aacute;hman demon, black as soot, with hair yellow as the lightning,
looking like a thunder-cloud. He had made himself a wreath of entrails;
he wore a sacrificial cord of hair; he was gnawing the flesh of a
man&rsquo;s head, and drinking blood out of a skull. The monster,
terrible with projecting tusks, uttered a horrible loud laugh, and
vomiting fire with rage, menaced the king in the following words,
&ldquo;Villain! know that I am a Br&aacute;hman demon,
Jv&aacute;l&aacute;mukha by name, and this <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;vattha</i>-tree my dwelling is not trespassed upon
even by gods, but thou hast presumed to occupy and enjoy it with thy
wife. So receive from me, returned from my nightly wanderings, the
fruit of thy presumption. I, even I, O wicked one, will tear out and
devour the heart of thee, whose mind love has overpowered, aye, and I
will drink thy blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this dreadful threat, and saw that his wife was
terrified, knowing that the monster was invulnerable, he humbly said to
him in his terror, &ldquo;Pardon the sin which I have ignorantly
committed against you, for I am a guest come to this your hermitage,
imploring your protection. And I will give you what you desire, by
bringing a human victim, whose flesh will glut your appetite; so be
appeased, and dismiss your anger.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman demon
heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s, he was pacified, and said to
himself, &ldquo;So be it! That will do.&rdquo; Then he said to the
king, &ldquo;I will overlook the insult you have offered me on the
following conditions. You must find a Br&aacute;hman boy, who, though
seven years old and intelligent, is of so noble a character that he is
ready to offer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>himself for your sake. And his mother and father
must place him on the earth, and hold him firmly by the hands and feet,
while he is being sacrificed. And when you have found such a human
victim, you must yourself slay him with a sword-stroke, and so offer
him up to me on the seventh day from this. If you comply with these
conditions, well and good; but, if not, king, I will in a moment
destroy you and all your court.&rdquo; When the king heard this, in his
terror he agreed at once to the conditions proposed, and the
Br&aacute;hman demon immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>Then king Chandr&aacute;valoka mounted his horse, and set out with
Ind&iacute;varaprabh&aacute; in quest of his army, in a state of the
utmost despondency. He said to himself, &ldquo;Alas! I, bewildered by
hunting and love, have suddenly incurred destruction like
P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10271src" href=
"#xd27e10271" name="xd27e10271src">9</a> fool that I am! For whence can
I obtain for this R&aacute;kshasa a victim, such as he has described?
So I will go in the meantime to my own town, and see what will
happen.&rdquo; While thus reflecting, he met his own army, that had
come in search of him, and with that and his wife he entered his city
of Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a. Then the whole kingdom rejoiced, when they
saw that he had obtained a suitable wife, but the king passed the rest
of the day in suppressed sorrow.</p>
<p>The next day he communicated to his ministers in secret all that had
taken place, and a discreet minister among them said to him, &ldquo;Do
not be downcast, king, for I will search for and bring you such a
victim, for the earth contains many marvels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the minister had consoled the king in these words, he had made
with the utmost rapidity a golden image of a seven-years-old child, and
he adorned its ears with jewels, and placed it on a chariot, and had it
carried about in the towns, villages, and stations of herdsmen. And
while that image of a child was being carried about, the minister had
the following proclamation continually made in front of it, with beat
of drum; &ldquo;If a Br&aacute;hman boy of seven years old will
willingly offer himself to a Br&aacute;hman demon for the good of the
community, and if his mother and father will permit the brave boy to
offer himself, and will hold his hands and feet while he is being
slain, the king will give to that boy, who is so eager to benefit his
parents as to comply with these conditions, this image of gold and
gems, together with a hundred villages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it happened that a certain seven-years-old Br&aacute;hman boy,
living on a royal grant to Br&aacute;hmans, who was of great courage
and admirable character, heard this proclamation. Even in his childhood
this boy had always taken pleasure in benefiting his fellow-men, as he
had practised that virtue in a former life; in fact he seemed like the
ripe result of the merits of the king&rsquo;s subjects incarnate in
bodily form. So he came and said to the men who were making this
proclamation, &ldquo;I will offer myself up for your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>good; but first, I will go and inform my
parents; then I will return to you.&rdquo; When he said this to them,
they were delighted, and they let him go. So he went home, and folding
his hands in an attitude of supplication, he said to his parents;
&ldquo;I wish to offer for the good of the community this perishable
body of mine; so permit me to do so, and put an end to your poverty.
For if I do so, the king will give me this image of myself, made of
gold and gems, together with a hundred villages, and on receiving them,
I will make them over to you. In this way I shall pay my debt to you,
and at the same time benefit my fellow-men; and your poverty will be at
an end, and you will have many sons to replace me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he had said this, his parents answered him; &ldquo;What
is this that you say, son? Are you distracted with wind? Or are you
planet-struck? Unless you are one of these, how could you talk in this
wild way? Who would cause his son&rsquo;s death for the sake of wealth?
What child would sacrifice its body?&rdquo; When the boy heard this
speech of his parents, he rejoined; &ldquo;I do not speak from a
disordered intellect; hear my speech, which is full of sense. This
body, which is full of indescribable impurities, which is loathsome by
its very birth, and the abode of pain, will soon perish<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10284src" href="#xd27e10284" name=
"xd27e10284src">10</a> anyhow. So wise men say that the only solid and
permanent thing in a fleeting universe is that merit which is acquired
by means of this very frail and perishable body.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10292src" href="#xd27e10292" name="xd27e10292src">11</a> And what
greater merit can there be than the benefiting of all creatures? So, if
I do not show devotion to my parents, what fruit shall I reap from my
body?&rdquo; By this speech and others of the same kind the resolute
boy induced his weeping parents to consent to his wish. And he went to
the king&rsquo;s servants, and obtained from them that golden image,
together with a grant of a hundred villages, and gave them to his
parents. Then he made the king&rsquo;s servants precede him, and went
quickly, accompanied by his parents, to the king in
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a. Then king Chandr&aacute;valoka, beholding
arrived the boy, whose courage<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10298src"
href="#xd27e10298" name="xd27e10298src">12</a> was so perfect, and who
thus resembled a bright protecting talisman, was exceedingly delighted.
So he had him adorned with garlands, and anointed with unguents, and
putting him on the back of an elephant, he took him with his parents to
the abode of the Br&aacute;hman demon.</p>
<p>Then the chaplain drew a circle near the <i lang=
"sa-latn">a&#347;vattha</i>-tree, and performed the requisite rites,
and made an oblation to the fire. And then the Br&aacute;hman demon
Jv&aacute;l&aacute;mukha appeared, uttering a loud laugh, and reciting
the Vedas. His appearance was very terrible; he was drunk with a full
draught of blood, yawning, and panting frequently; his eyes blazed, and
he darkened the whole horizon with the shadow of his body. Then king
Chandr&aacute;valoka, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href=
"#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>beholding him, bent before him,
and said; &ldquo;Adorable one, I have brought you this human sacrifice,
and it is now the seventh day, gentle Sir, since I promised it you; so
be propitious, receive this sacrifice, as is due.&rdquo; When the king
made this request, the Br&aacute;hman demon looked at the
Br&aacute;hman boy, licking the corners of his mouth with his
tongue.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10310src" href="#xd27e10310" name=
"xd27e10310src">13</a></p>
<p>At that moment the noble boy, in his joy, said to himself,
&ldquo;Let not the merit, which I acquire by this sacrifice of my body,
gain for me heaven, or even a salvation which involves no benefits to
others, but may I be privileged to offer up my body for the benefit of
others in birth after birth!&rdquo; While he was forming this
aspiration, the heaven was suddenly filled with the chariots of the
heavenly host, who rained flowers.</p>
<p>Then the boy was placed in front of the Br&aacute;hman demon, and
his mother took hold of his hands and his father of his feet. Then the
king drew his sword, and prepared to slay him; but at that moment the
child laughed so loudly, that all there, the Br&aacute;hman demon
included, abandoned the occupation in which they were engaged, and in
their astonishment put their palms together, and bowing, looked at his
face.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this entertaining and romantic tale,
he once more put a question to king Trivikramasena; &ldquo;So tell me,
king, what was the reason that the boy laughed in such an awful moment
as that of his own death? I feel great curiosity to know it, so, if you
know, and do not tell me, your head shall split into a hundred
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this from the Vet&aacute;la, he answered him,
&ldquo;Hear what was the meaning of that child&rsquo;s laugh. It is
well known that a weak creature, when danger comes upon it, calls upon
its father or mother to save its life. And if its father and mother be
gone, it invokes the protection of the king who is appointed to succour
the afflicted, and if it cannot obtain the aid of the king, it calls
upon the deity under whose special protection it is. Now, in the case
of that child, all those were present, and all behaved in exactly the
opposite manner to what might have been expected of them. The
child&rsquo;s parents held its hands and feet out of greed of gain, and
the king was eager to slay it, to save his own life, and the
Br&aacute;hman demon, its protecting deity, was ready to devour it. The
child said to itself; &lsquo;To think that these should be thus
deluded, being led so much astray for the sake of the body, which is
perishable, loathsome within, and full of pain and disease. Why should
they have such a strange longing for the continuance of the body, in a
world in which Brahm&aacute;, Indra, Vish&#7751;u, &#346;iva, and the
other gods must certainly perish.&rsquo; Accordingly the Br&aacute;hman
boy laughed out of joy and wonder, joy at feeling that he had
accomplished his object, and wonder at beholding the marvellous
strangeness of their delusion.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the king had said this, he ceased, and the Vet&aacute;la
immediately left his shoulder, and went back to his own place,
disappearing by his magic power. But the king, without hesitating for a
moment, rapidly pursued him; the hearts of great men, as of great seas,
are firm and unshaken.</p>

<p class="first">Oesterley (p. 210) tells us that a boy is in the same
way sold to a king as a victim in the 32nd tale of the Turkish
collection of tales, called &ldquo;The Forty Viziers.&rdquo; When the
king is about to rip up the child&rsquo;s body, the child laughs for
the same reason as in our text. The cause of the sacrifice is however
different. The king is to be healed by placing his feet in the body of
a boy.</p>
<p>The promise of a golden image to any one who is willing to sacrifice
his life is also found in the Bengali edition of the
Sinh&aacute;sana-dv&aacute;trin&#347;ati. A rich man makes a golden
image, with an inscription on it to the effect that whoever is willing
to sacrifice his life shall have it. Vikram&aacute;ditya goes to the
place disguised, and cuts off his head, but the goddess heals him,

<h3 class="main">Story of Anangamanjar&iacute;, her husband
Ma&#7751;ivarman, and the Br&aacute;hman Kamal&aacute;kara.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city called Vi&#347;&aacute;l&aacute;,
which is like a second city of Indra, made by the Creator on earth, for
the sake of virtuous people who have fallen from heaven. In it there
lived a fortunate king, named Padman&aacute;bha, who was a source of
joy to good men, and excelled king Bali. In the reign of that king
there lived in that city a great merchant, named Arthadatta, who
surpassed in opulence the god of wealth. And to him there was born a
daughter named Anangamanjar&iacute;, who was exhibited on earth by the
Creator as a likeness of a heavenly nymph. And that merchant gave her
to the son of a distinguished merchant, dwelling in
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, and named Ma&#7751;ivarman. But as he was
very fond of his daughter Anangamanjar&iacute;, because she was his
only child, he would not let her leave his house, but kept her there
with her husband. But Anangamanjar&iacute;&rsquo;s husband
Ma&#7751;ivarman was as distasteful to her, as a biting bitter medicine
to a sick man. But that lovely one was dearer than life to her husband,
as wealth hardly won and long hoarded is to a miser. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now once on a time that Ma&#7751;ivarman, longing to see his
parents, went to his home in T&aacute;mralipt&iacute; to visit them.
After some days had passed, the hot season descended upon the land,
impeding the journey of men absent from home with the sharp shafts of
the sun&rsquo;s rays. The winds blew laden with the fragrance of the
jasmine and trumpet-flower, and seemed like the hot<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10355src" href="#xd27e10355" name="xd27e10355src">1</a> sighs
of the cardinal points on account of the departure of spring. Lines of
dust raised by the wind flew up to heaven, like messengers sent by the
heated earth to hasten the approach of the clouds. The days passed
slowly, like travellers exhausted by the severe heat, and longing for
the shade of the trees. The nights, pale-gleaming with moonbeams,
became exceedingly<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10363src" href=
"#xd27e10363" name="xd27e10363src">2</a> reduced owing to the loss of
the spring with all its happy meetings.</p>
<p>One day in that season, that merchant&rsquo;s daughter
Anangamanjar&iacute; was sitting with her intimate friend in a lofty
window of her house, white with sandal-wood ointment, and elegantly
dressed in a thin garment of silk. While there, she saw a young
Br&aacute;hman, named Kamal&aacute;kara, the son of the king&rsquo;s
chaplain, passing by, and he looked like the god of Love, risen from
his ashes, going to find Rati. And when Kamal&aacute;kara saw that
lovely one overhead, like the orb of the moon,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10374src" href="#xd27e10374" name="xd27e10374src">3</a> he was
full of joy, and became like a cluster of <i>kumuda</i>-flowers. The
sight of those two young persons became to one another, by the mighty
command of Cupid, a priceless<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10392src"
href="#xd27e10392" name="xd27e10392src">4</a> fascination of the mind.
And the two were overcome by passion, which rooted up their modesty and
carried away by a storm of love-frenzy, which flung their minds to a
distance. And Kamal&aacute;kara&rsquo;s companion, as soon as he saw
that his friend was love-smitten, dragged him off, though with
difficulty, to his own house.</p>
<p>As for Anangamanjar&iacute;, she enquired what his name was, and
having no will of her own, slowly entered the house with that
confidante of hers. There she was grievously afflicted with the fever
of love, and thinking on her beloved, she rolled on the bed, and
neither saw nor heard anything. After two or three days had passed,
being ashamed and afraid, unable to bear the misery of separation, thin
and pale, and despairing of union with her beloved, which seemed a
thing impossible, she determined on suicide. So, one night, when her
attendants were asleep, she went out, drawn as it were, by the moon,
which sent its rays through the window, like fingers, and made for a
tank at the foot of a tree in her own garden. There she approached an
image of the goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, her family deity, that
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>been set up with much magnificence by her
father, and she bowed before the goddess, and praised her, and said,
&ldquo;Though I have not obtained Kamal&aacute;kara for a husband in
this life, let him be my husband in a future birth!&rdquo; When the
impassioned woman had uttered these words in front of the goddess, she
made a noose with her upper garment, and fastened it to an
<i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile it happened that her confidante, who was sleeping
in the same room, woke up, and not seeing her there, went to the garden
to look for her. And seeing her there engaged in fastening a noose
round her neck, she cried out, &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; and running
up, she cut that noose which she had made. Anangamanjar&iacute;, when
she saw that her confidante had come and cut the noose, fell on the
ground in a state of great affliction. Her confidante comforted her,
and asked her the cause of her grief, and she at once told her, and
went on to say to her, &ldquo;So you see, friend
M&aacute;latik&aacute;, as I am under the authority of my parents and
so on, and have little chance of being united to my beloved, death is
my highest happiness.&rdquo; While Anangamanjar&iacute; was saying
these words, she was exceedingly tortured with the fire of Love&rsquo;s
arrows, and being overpowered with despair, she fainted away.</p>
<p>Her friend M&aacute;latik&aacute; exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas! the
command of Cupid is hard to resist, since it has reduced to this state
this friend of mine, who was always laughing at other misguided women,
who shewed a want of self-restraint.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10409src" href="#xd27e10409" name="xd27e10409src">5</a>&rdquo;
Lamenting in these words, she slowly brought Anangamanjar&iacute; round
with cold water, fanning, and so on, and in order to allay her heat,
she made her a bed of lotus-leaves, and placed on her heart a necklace
cool as snow. Then Anangamanjar&iacute;, with her eyes gushing with
tears, said to her friend, &ldquo;Friend, the necklace and the other
applications do not allay my internal heat. But do you by your
cleverness accomplish something which will really allay it. Unite me to
my beloved, if you wish to preserve my life.&rdquo; When she said this,
M&aacute;latik&aacute; lovingly answered her, &ldquo;My friend, the
night is now almost at an end, but to-morrow I will make an arrangement
with your beloved, and bring him to this very place. So in the
meanwhile control yourself, and enter your house.&rdquo; When she said
this, Anangamanjar&iacute; was pleased, and drawing the necklace from
her neck, she gave it to her as a present. And she said to her,
&ldquo;Now go to your house, and early to-morrow go thence to the house
of my beloved, and may you prosper!&rdquo; Having dismissed her
confidante in these words, she entered her own apartments.</p>
<p>And early next morning, her friend M&aacute;latik&aacute; went,
without being seen by any one, to the house of Kamal&aacute;kara; and
searching about in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href=
"#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>garden, she saw him at the foot of
a tree. He was rolling about, burning with the fire of love, on a bed
composed of lotus-leaves moistened with sandal-wood juice, and a
confidential friend of his was trying to give him relief by fanning him
with a plantain-leaf. She said to herself, &ldquo;Is it possible that
he has been reduced to this stage of love&rsquo;s malady by separation
from her<span class="corr" id="xd27e10425" title=
"Source: &rdquo;?">?&rdquo;</span> So she remained there in
concealment, to find out the truth about it.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that friend of Kamal&aacute;kara&rsquo;s said to
him, &ldquo;Cast your eye, my friend, for a moment round this
delightful garden, and cheer up your heart. Do not give way to
despondency.&rdquo; When the young Br&aacute;hman heard this, he
answered his friend, &ldquo;My friend, my heart has been taken from me
by Anangamanjar&iacute; the merchant&rsquo;s daughter, and my breast
left empty; so how can I cheer up my heart. Moreover Love, finding me
robbed of my heart, has made me a quiver for his arrows; so enable me
to get hold of that girl, who stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young Br&aacute;hman said that,
M&aacute;latik&aacute;&rsquo;s doubts were removed, and she was
delighted, and showed herself, and went up to him, and said,
&ldquo;Happy man, Anangamanjar&iacute; has sent me to you, and I hereby
give you her message, the meaning of which is clear, &lsquo;What sort
of conduct is this for a virtuous man, to enter a fair one&rsquo;s
bosom by force, and after stealing away her heart, to go off without
showing himself.&rsquo; It is strange too, that though you have stolen
the lady&rsquo;s heart, she now wishes to surrender to you herself and
her life. For day and night she furnaces forth from her hot sighs,
which appear like smoke rising from the fire of love in her burning
heart. And her tear-drops, black with collyrium, fall frequently,
looking like bees attracted by the fragrance of her lotus-like face. So
if you like, I will say what will be for the good of both of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When <span class="corr" id="xd27e10434" title=
"Source: Malatik&aacute;">M&aacute;latik&aacute;</span> said this,
Kamal&aacute;kara answered her, &ldquo;My good lady, this speech of
yours, though it comforts me by shewing that my beloved loves me,
terrifies me, as it tells that the fair one is in a state of
unhappiness. So you are our only refuge in this matter; do as you think
best.&rdquo; When Kamal&aacute;kara said this, M&aacute;latik&aacute;
answered, &ldquo;I will to-night bring Anangamanjar&iacute; secretly
into the garden belonging to her house, and you must take care to be
outside. Then I will manage by some device of mine to let you in, and
so you will be able to see one another in accordance with your
wishes.&rdquo; When M&aacute;latik&aacute; had by these words delighted
the young Br&aacute;hman, she went away, having accomplished her
object, and delighted Anangamanjar&iacute; also.</p>
<p>Then the sun, in love with the twilight, departed somewhere or
other, together with the day, and the heaven adorned itself, placing
the moon on its western quarter, like a patch on the forehead. And the
pure white <i>kumuda</i>-cluster laughed joyously with the cheerful
faces of its opened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346"
name="pb346">346</a>]</span>flowers, as if to say, &ldquo;Fortune has
left the lotus-cluster and come to me.&rdquo; Thereupon the lover
Kamal&aacute;kara also adorned himself, and full of impatience, slowly
approached the outside of the door that led into the garden of
Anangamanjar&iacute;&rsquo;s house. Then M&aacute;latik&aacute; managed
to bring into that garden Anangamanjar&iacute;, who had with difficulty
got through the day. And she made her sit in the middle of it, in a
bower of mango-trees, and went out, and brought in Kamal&aacute;kara
also. And when he entered, he beheld Anangamanjar&iacute; in the midst
of dense-foliaged trees, as gladly as the traveller beholds the
shade.</p>
<p>While he was advancing towards her, she saw him, and as the violence
of her passion robbed her of shame, she eagerly ran forward, and threw
her arms round his neck. She faltered out, &ldquo;Where are you going?
I have caught you,&rdquo; and immediately her breath was stopped by the
weight of excessive joy, and she died. And she fell on the ground, like
a creeper broken by the wind. Alas! strange is the course of love, that
is terrible in its consequences. When Kamal&aacute;kara beheld that
misfortune, which was terrible as a thunder-stroke, he said,
&ldquo;Alas! what is this?&rdquo; and fell senseless on the ground. In
a moment he recovered consciousness; and then he took his beloved up in
his arms, and embraced and kissed her, and lamented much. And then he
was so violently oppressed by excessive weight of sorrow, that his
heart burst asunder at once, with a crack. And when
M&aacute;latik&aacute; was lamenting over their corpses, the night,
seeing that both these lovers had met their end, came to an end, as if
out of grief. And the next day, the relations of both, hearing from the
gardeners what had happened, came there distracted with shame, wonder,
grief, and bewilderment. And they remained for a long time doubtful
what to do, with faces downcast from distress; bad women are a grievous
affliction, and a source of calamity to their family.</p>
<p>At this moment Ma&#7751;ivarman, the husband of
Anangamanjar&iacute;, came, full of longing to see her, from his
father&rsquo;s house in T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;. When he reached his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and heard what had taken place, he came
running to that garden, with his eyes blinded with tears. There,
beholding his wife lying dead by the side of another man, the
passionate man at once yielded up his breath, that was heated with the
fire of grief. Then the people there began to cry out, and to make an
uproar, and all the citizens heard what had taken place, and came there
in a state of astonishment.</p>
<p>Then the goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, who was close at hand,
having been called down into that garden long ago by the father of
Anangamanjar&iacute;, was thus supplicated by her Ga&#7751;as;
&ldquo;Goddess, this merchant Arthadatta, who has established an image
of thee in his garden, has always been devoted to thee, so have mercy
upon him in this his affliction.&rdquo; When the beloved of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>&#346;iva, the refuge of the distressed, heard
this prayer of her Ga&#7751;as, she gave command that the three should
return to life, free from passion. So they all, by her favour,
immediately arose, as if awaking from sleep, free from the passion of
love. Then all the people were full of joy, beholding that marvel; and
Kamal&aacute;kara went home, with his face downcast from shame; and
Arthadatta, having recovered his daughter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10453src" href="#xd27e10453" name="xd27e10453src">6</a>
Anangamanjar&iacute;, who looked thoroughly ashamed of herself,
together with her husband, returned to his house in high spirits.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story that night on the way, he
again put a question to king Trivikramasena. He said, &ldquo;King, tell
me, which of those three, who were blinded by passion, was the most
infatuated? And remember, the curse <span class="corr" id="xd27e10464"
title="Source: beforementioned">before-mentioned</span> will take
effect, if you know and do not say.&rdquo; When the king heard this
question of the Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s, he answered him, &ldquo;It seems
to me that Ma&#7751;ivarman was the most infatuated with passion of the
three. For one can understand those two dying, as they were desperately
in love with one another, and their amorous condition had been fully
developed by lapse of time. But Ma&#7751;ivarman was terribly
infatuated, for when he saw his wife dead of love for another man, and
the occasion called for indignation, he was so far from being angry
that, in his great love, he died of grief.&rdquo; When the king had
said this, the mighty Vet&aacute;la again left his shoulder, and
departed to his own place, and the king again went in pursuit of
him.</p>

<p class="first">Oesterley, page 217, gives a story which resembles
this in its conclusion. A king finds a girl being carried off by
robbers. He delivers her and places her in a temple, promising to bring
her food. But on his way he meets a <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>,
who conducts him to another girl, with whom he falls desperately in
love, and so forgets the girl he rescued. She is found by a merchant.
He takes her to his house and sets food before her. He then kills a
rat, and boasts of his valour; (see page 16 of this volume.) This
conduct, contrasted with that of the king, makes the girl die of
disgust. The merchant kills himself. The king, not finding the first
girl where he left her, commits suicide. The
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> considers that she has caused the
death of three persons, and kills herself in a fit of remorse. The
Vet&aacute;la asks, &ldquo;Which of these four deaths was the most
extraordinary?&rdquo; The king answers, &ldquo;That of the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, for the others died of excess of

<h3 class="main">Story of the four Br&aacute;hman brothers who
resuscitated the tiger.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived once on the earth a king, named
Dhara&#7751;&iacute;var&aacute;ha, who was lord of the town of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10498src" href=
"#xd27e10498" name="xd27e10498src">1</a> In his realm, which abounded
in Br&aacute;hmans, there was a royal grant to Br&aacute;hmans named
Brahmasthala; and on it there lived a Br&aacute;hman of the name of
Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min. He had a wife that was as well-suited to him
as the oblation to the fire. And in course of time he had four sons by
her. And when they had learnt the Vedas, and passed their childhood,
Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min went to heaven, and his wife followed
him.</p>
<p>Then all his sons there, being in a miserable state, as they had no
protectors, and having had all their property taken from them by their
relations, deliberated together, and said, &ldquo;We have no means of
support here, so why should we not go hence to the house of our
maternal grandfather in the village named Yajnasthala?&rdquo; Having
determined on this, they set out, living on alms, and after many days
they reached the house of their maternal grandfather. Their grandfather
was dead, but their mother&rsquo;s brothers gave them shelter and food,
and they lived in their house, engaged in reading the Vedas. But after
a time, as they were paupers, their uncles came to despise them, and
neglected to supply them with food, clothes, and other necessaries.</p>
<p>Then their hearts were wounded by the manifest contempt shewn for
them by their relations, and they brooded over it in secret, and then
the eldest brother said to the rest; &ldquo;Well! brothers, what are we
to do? Destiny performs every thing, no man can do anything in this
world at any place or time. For to-day, as I was wandering about in a
state of distraction, I reached a cemetery; and in it I saw a man lying
dead upon the ground, with all his limbs relaxed. And when I saw him, I
envied his state, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href=
"#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>I said to myself; &lsquo;Fortunate
is this man, who is thus at rest, having got rid of his burden of
grief.&rsquo; Such was the reflection that then occurred to me; so I
determined to die: and I tried to hang myself by means of a rope
fastened to the branch of a tree. I became unconscious, but my breath
did not leave my body; and while I was in this state, the rope broke,
and I fell to the earth. And as soon as I recovered consciousness, I
saw that some compassionate man was fanning me with his garment. He
said to me, &lsquo;Friend, say, why do you allow yourself to be thus
afflicted, though you are wise? For joy springs from good deeds, and
pain from evil deeds, these are their only sources. If your agitation
is due to pain, then perform good deeds; how can you be so foolish as
to desire to incur the pains of hell by suicide?&rsquo; With these
words that man consoled me, and then departed somewhere or other, but I
have come here, having abandoned my design of committing suicide. So,
you see that, if Destiny is adverse, it is not even possible to die.
Now I intend to go to some holy water, and there consume my body with
austerities, in order that I may never again endure the misery of
poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the eldest brother said this, his younger brothers said to him,
&ldquo;Sir, why are you, though wise, afflicted with pain merely
because you are poor? Do you not know that riches pass away like an
autumn cloud. Who can ever count on retaining Fortune or a fickle
woman, though he carry them off and guard them carefully, for both are
insincere in their affection and secretly hostile to their possessor?
So a wise man must acquire by vigorous exertion some eminent
accomplishment, which will enable him frequently to bind<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10515src" href="#xd27e10515" name=
"xd27e10515src">2</a> and lead home by force riches which are like
bounding deer.&rdquo; When the eldest brother was addressed in this
language by his brothers, he at once recovered his self-control, and
said, &ldquo;What accomplishment of this kind should we acquire?&rdquo;
Then they all considered and said to one another, &ldquo;We will search
through the earth and acquire some magic power.&rdquo; So having
adopted this resolution, and fixed upon a trysting-place at which to
meet, the four separated, going east, west, north and south.</p>
<p>And in course of time they met again at the appointed spot, and
asked one another what each had learned. Then one of them said,
&ldquo;I have learned this magic secret; if I find a bit of a bone of
any animal, I can immediately produce on it the flesh of that
animal.&rdquo; When the second heard this speech of his
brother&rsquo;s, he said, &ldquo;When the flesh of any animal has been
superinduced upon a piece of bone, I know how to produce the skin and
hair appropriate to that animal.&rdquo; Then the third said, &ldquo;And
when the hair and flesh and skin have been produced, I am able to
create the limbs of the animal to which the bone belonged.&rdquo; And
the fourth said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350"
name="pb350">350</a>]</span>&ldquo;When the animal has its limbs
properly developed, I know how to endow it with life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had said this to one another, the four brothers went into
the forest to find a piece of bone, on which to display their skill.
There it happened that they found a piece of a lion&rsquo;s bone, and
they took it up without knowing to what animal it belonged. Then the
first covered it with the appropriate flesh, and the second in the same
way produced on it all the requisite skin and hair, and the third
completed the animal by giving it all its appropriate limbs, and it
became a lion, and then the fourth endowed it with life. Then it rose
up a very terrible lion, furnished with a dense shaggy mane, having a
mouth formidable with teeth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10530src" href=
"#xd27e10530" name="xd27e10530src">3</a> and with hooked claws at the
end of its paws. And charging the four authors of its being, it slew
them on the spot, and then retired glutted to the forest. So those
Br&aacute;hmans perished by making the fatal mistake of creating a
lion: for who can give joy to his own soul by raising up a noisome
beast?</p>
<p>So, if Fate be not propitious, an accomplishment, though painfully
acquired, not only does not bring prosperity, but actually brings
destruction. For the tree of valour only bears fruit, as a general
rule, when the root, being uninjured,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10538src" href="#xd27e10538" name="xd27e10538src">4</a> is
watered with the water of wisdom, and when it is surrounded with the
trench of policy.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, sitting on the shoulder of the king, had
told this tale on the way, that night, to king Trivikramasena, he went
on to say to him, &ldquo;King, which of these four was guilty in
respect of the production of the lion, that slew them all? Tell me
quickly, and remember that the old condition is still binding on
you.&rdquo; When the king heard the Vet&aacute;la say this, he said to
himself, &ldquo;This demon wishes me to break silence, and so to escape
from me. Never mind, I will go and fetch him again.&rdquo; Having
formed this resolution in his heart, he answered that Vet&aacute;la,
&ldquo;That one among them, who gave life to the lion, is the guilty
one. For they produced the flesh, the skin, the hair, and the limbs, by
magic power, without knowing what kind of animal they were making: and
therefore no guilt attaches to them on account of their ignorance. But
the man, who, when he saw that the animal had a lion&rsquo;s shape,
gave life to it, in order to display his skill, was guilty of the death
of those Br&aacute;hmans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mighty Vet&aacute;la heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s,
he again left his shoulder by magic power and went back to his own
place, and the king again went in pursuit of him. <span class=

<p class="first">The story, as given in the Panchatantra (Benfey, Vol.
II, p. 332), is somewhat different. Here we have four brothers of whom
three possess all knowledge, but one only possesses common sense. The
first brother joins together the bones of the lion, the second covers
them with skin, flesh, and blood, the third is about to give the animal
life, when the brother, who possesses common sense, says &ldquo;If you
raise him to life, he will kill us all.&rdquo; Finding that the third
brother will not desist from his intention, he climbs up a tree and so
saves his life, while his three brothers are torn to pieces.</p>

again took down that Vet&aacute;la from the <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree, and
though the Vet&aacute;la transformed himself in all possible ways, he

<h3 class="main">Story of the Hermit who first wept and then
danced.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the land of Kalinga a city named
&#346;obh&aacute;vat&iacute;, like the city of Indra in heaven, the
abode of those that act aright. It was ruled by a king named Pradyumna,
whose sway was mighty, and who, like the god Pradyumna, was celebrated
for his exceeding power and valour. The only detraction heard in his
realm was that of the string from the bow, the only pressure that of
the fingers on the cymbal, vice was only known in the name of the
age,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10575src" href="#xd27e10575" name=
"xd27e10575src">1</a> and keenness only in the pursuit of
knowledge.</p>
<p>In a certain part of that town there was a grant named Yajnasthala,
given by that king, on which many Br&aacute;hmans were settled. There
lived on it a very wealthy Br&aacute;hman who had mastered the Vedas,
whose name was Yajnasoma. He maintained a sacrificial fire, and
honoured guests, and the gods. After his youth was past, there was born
to him by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>his wife, who was in every way a suitable match
for him, an only son, the child of a hundred wishes. And that promising
boy grew up in his father&rsquo;s house, and the Br&aacute;hmans duly
named him Devasoma. And when he had attained the age of sixteen years,
that boy, who captivated all by his knowledge, modesty, and other good
qualities, suddenly died of a fever. Then Yajnasoma, together with his
wife, remained lovingly embracing that dead boy, and lamenting over
him, and refused for a long time to let him be taken away to be
burnt.</p>
<p>Then the old men assembled and reproved that Br&aacute;hman in the
following words, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, are you not aware, though you
know what is near and far, that the condition of this Fata Morgana of a
world is frail as a bubble on water? Look at those kings who filled the
earth with their armies, and enjoyed themselves in this world, deeming
themselves immortal, lying on jewelled couches on the delightful
summits of palaces, that resounded with the warbling of music, having
their bodies anointed with sandal-wood ointment and other fragrant
unguents, and begirt with beautiful women. Even these no one could save
from being consumed by flesh-devouring flames, lying alone on the
funeral pyre in the cemetery whither the dead are followed by weeping
friends, and when their extremities had been shrivelled, from being at
last devoured by the jackals: much less can any others escape this
fate. So tell us, wise man, what mean you by embracing that
corpse?&rdquo; Many other speeches of this kind did they address to
him.</p>
<p>At last with difficulty his relations got him to stop clinging to
his dead son, and then, after the body had been laid out, they put it
on a bier, and with loud lamentations carried it to the burning-place,
accompanied by many people who shed tears on account of the
calamity.</p>
<p>Now at that time there was dwelling in that cemetery an old
P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic possessing supernatural power, who lived
in a hut. His name was V&aacute;ma&#347;iva. His body was emaciated
with age and excessive asceticism, and bound round with veins, as if
for fear that it would break. He was covered all over with hair white
with ashes, his matted locks were yellow as lightning, and he looked
like a second &#346;iva. When that hermit heard in the distance the
lamentation of those people outside his hut, he said to the pupil that
lived with him, &ldquo;Rise up! go and find out the meaning of this
confused noise outside in the cemetery, such as I never heard before,
and come back quickly, and tell me.&rdquo; Now this pupil was one who
had taken a vow of living on the products of begging; he was a fool,
and a rogue, and an egoist, puffed up with contemplation, magical
powers, and other things of the kind, and at this time he was annoyed
because his teacher had rebuked him. So, when his teacher gave him this
order, he answered him, &ldquo;I will not go; go yourself, for my time
for begging is fast slipping away.&rdquo; When the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>teacher heard that, he said, &ldquo;Out on you,
fool, devoted to your belly! Only half one watch of the day has passed:
how can it be your time for begging now?&rdquo; When the wicked pupil
heard that, he was angry, and said to his teacher; &ldquo;Out on you,
you decrepit old creature! I am no longer your pupil, and you are no
longer my teacher. I will go elsewhere, carry this vessel
yourself.&rdquo; When he had said this, he put down in front of him his
stick and water-vessel, and got up and went away.</p>
<p>Then the hermit left his hut, laughing as he went, and came to the
place where the young Br&aacute;hman had been brought to be burned. And
when the hermit saw him, with the people lamenting for the flower of
his youth, being afflicted with old age, and possessed of magical
powers, he determined to enter his body. So he quickly went aside, and
first wept aloud, and immediately afterwards he danced with appropriate
gesticulations.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10606src" href="#xd27e10606"
name="xd27e10606src">2</a> Then the ascetic, longing to be young again,
abandoned his own body, and at once entered by magic power that young
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s body. And immediately the young Br&aacute;hman
on the pyre, which was ready prepared, returned to life, and rose up
with a yawn. When his relations and all the people saw that, they
raised a loud shout of &ldquo;Hurrah! he is alive! he is
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that ascetic, who was a mighty sorcerer, and had thus entered
the young Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s body, not intending to abandon his
vow, told them all the following falsehood; &ldquo;Just now, when I
went to the other world, &#346;iva himself restored my life to me,
telling me that I must take upon me the vow of a P&aacute;&#347;upata
ascetic. And I must this moment go into a solitary place and support
this vow, otherwise I cannot live, so depart you, and I also will
depart.&rdquo; Saying this to all those present, the resolute votary,
bewildered with mixed feelings of joy and grief, dismissed them to
their own homes. And he himself went, and threw that former body of his
into a ravine; and so that great magician, who had taken the vow,
having become young, went away to another place.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story that night on the way, he
again said to king Trivikramasena, &ldquo;Tell me, king, why did that
mighty magician, when entering another body, first weep, and then
dance? I have a great desire to know this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that king, who was a chief of sages, heard this question of the
Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s, fearing the curse, he broke silence, and gave
him this answer, &ldquo;Hear what the feelings of that ascetic were. He
was grieved because he thought that he was just going to abandon that
body, which had grown up with him through many years, by living in
which he had acquired magic power, and which his parents had fondled,
when he was a child, so he wept violently; for affection for
one&rsquo;s body is a deeply rooted feeling. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>But
he danced for joy, because he thought that he was about to enter a new
body, and that by means of that he would acquire greater magic power;
for to whom is not youth pleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la, who was inside that corpse, heard this
speech of the king&rsquo;s, he left his shoulder and went back to that
<i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree; but that exceedingly undaunted monarch again
ran after him, to recover him; for the resolution of determined men
surpasses in firmness the mighty mountains, and remains unshaken even
at the end of a <i>kalpa</i>.</p>

<p class="first">Then the brave king Trivikramasena, disregarding the
awful night, which in that terrible cemetery assumed the appearance of
a R&aacute;kshas&iacute;, being black with darkness, and having the
flames of the funeral pyres for fiery eyes, again went to the
<i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree, and took from it the Vet&aacute;la, and put him
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>And while he was going along with him, as before, the Vet&aacute;la

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of the father that married the daughter and the
son that married the mother.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in the Dekkan a king of a small province,
who was named Dharma; he was the chief of virtuous men, but he had many
relations who aspired to supplant him. He had a wife named
Chandravat&iacute;, who came from the land of M&aacute;lava; she was of
high lineage, and the most virtuous of women. And that king had born to
him by that wife one daughter, who was not without cause named
L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10642src"
href="#xd27e10642" name="xd27e10642src">1</a></p>
<p>And when that daughter had attained a marriageable age, king Dharma
was ejected from his throne by his relations, who banded together and
divided his realm. Then he fled from his kingdom at night with his wife
and that daughter, taking with him a large number of valuable jewels,
and he deliberately set out for M&aacute;lava the dwelling-place of his
father-in-law. And in the course of that same night he reached the
Vindhya forest with his wife and daughter. And when he entered it, the
night, that had escorted him thus far, took leave of him with drops of
dew by way of tears. And the sun ascended the eastern mountain,
stretching forth its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"
name="pb355">355</a>]</span>first rays, like a warning hand, to
dissuade him from entering that brigand-haunted wood. Then he travelled
on through it with his wife and daughter, having his feet wounded with
sharp points of <i>ku&#347;a</i>-grass, and he reached a village of the
Bhillas. It was full of men that robbed their neighbours of life and
property, and shunned by the virtuous, like the strong city of
Death.</p>
<p>Then beholding the king from a distance with his dress and
ornaments, many &#346;avaras, armed with various weapons, ran to
plunder him. When king Dharma saw that, he said to his daughter and
wife, &ldquo;The barbarians will seize on you first, so enter the wood
in this direction.&rdquo; When the king said this to them, queen
Chandravat&iacute; and her daughter L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute;, in
their terror, plunged into the middle of the wood. And the brave king,
armed with sword and shield, killed many of the &#346;avaras, who came
towards him, raining arrows. Then the chief summoned the whole village,
and falling on the king, who stood there alone, they slashed his shield
to pieces and killed him; and then the host of bandits departed with
his ornaments. And queen Chandravat&iacute;, concealed in a thicket of
the wood, saw from a distance her husband slain: so in her bewilderment
she fled with her daughter, and they entered another dense forest a
long distance off. There they found that the shadows of the trees,
afflicted by the heat of midday, had laid themselves at their cool
roots, imitating travellers. So, tired and sad, the queen sat down
weeping with her daughter, in a spot on the bank of a lotus-lake, under
the shade of an <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a chief, who lived near, came to that forest on
horseback, with his son, to hunt. He was named Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha,
and when he saw their footsteps imprinted in the dust, he said to his
son Sinhapar&aacute;krama, &ldquo;We will follow up these lovely and
auspicious tracks, and if we find the ladies to whom they belong, you
shall choose whichever you please of them.&rdquo; When
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha said this, his son Sinhapar&aacute;krama said
to him, &ldquo;I should like to have for a wife the one that has these
small feet, for I know that she will be young and suited to me. But
this one with large feet, being older than the other, will just suit
you. When Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha heard this speech of his son&rsquo;s,
he said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you say? Your mother has only
recently gone to heaven, and now that I have lost so good a wife, how
can I desire another?&rdquo; When Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha&rsquo;s son
heard that, he said to him, &ldquo;Father, do not say so, for the home
of a householder is empty without a wife. Moreover, have you not heard
the stanza composed by M&uacute;ladeva? &lsquo;Who, that is not a fool,
enters that house in which there is no shapely love eagerly awaiting
his return, which, though called a house, is really a prison without
chains.&rsquo; So, father, my death will lie at your door, if you do
not take as your wife that companion of the lady whom I have
chosen.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha heard this speech of his son&rsquo;s,
he approved it, and went on slowly with him, tracking up their
footsteps. And he reached that spot near the lake, and saw that dark
queen Chandravat&iacute;, adorned with many strings of pearls, sitting
in the shade of a tree. She looked like the midnight sky in the middle
of the day, and her daughter L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute;, like the
pure white moonlight, seemed to illumine her. And he and his son
eagerly approached her, and she, when she saw him, rose up terrified,
thinking that he was a bandit.</p>
<p>But the queen&rsquo;s daughter said to her, &ldquo;Mother, do not be
afraid, these are not bandits, these two gentle-looking well-dressed
persons are certainly some nobles come here to hunt.&rdquo; However the
queen still continued to hesitate; and then Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha got
down from his horse and said to the two ladies, &ldquo;Do not be
alarmed; we have come here to see you out of love; so take
confidence<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10666src" href="#xd27e10666"
name="xd27e10666src">2</a> and tell us fearlessly who you are, since
you seem like Rati and Pr&iacute;ti fled to this wood in sorrow at
Cupid&rsquo;s having been consumed by the flames of &#346;iva&rsquo;s
fiery eye. And how did you two come to enter this unpeopled wood? For
these forms of yours are fitted to dwell in a gem-adorned palace. And
our minds are tortured to think how your feet, that deserve to be
supported by the lap of beautiful women, can have traversed this ground
full of thorns. And, strange to say, the dust raised by the wind,
falling on your faces, makes our faces lose their brightness from
despondency.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10675src" href="#xd27e10675"
name="xd27e10675src">3</a> And the furious heat of the beams of the
fierce-rayed sun, as it plays on your flower-soft bodies, burns us. So
tell us your story; for our hearts are afflicted; we cannot bear to see
you thus abiding in a forest full of wild beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha said this, the queen sighed, and full
of shame and grief, slowly told him her story. Then
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, seeing that she had no protector, comforted
her and her daughter, and coaxed them with kind words into becoming
members of his family. And he and his son put the queen and her
daughter on their horses, and conducted them to their rich palace in
Vittapapur&iacute;. And the queen, being helpless, submitted to his
will, as if she had been born again in a second life. What is an
unprotected woman, fallen into calamity in a foreign land, to do? Then
Sinhapar&aacute;krama, the son of Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, made
Chandravat&iacute; his wife, on account of the smallness of her feet.
And Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha made her daughter, the princess
L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute;, his wife, on account of the largeness
of her feet. For they made this agreement originally, when they saw the
two tracks of the small footsteps and the large footsteps: and who ever
swerves from his plighted word? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357"
href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span></p>
<p>So, from the mistake about the feet, the daughter became the wife of
the father, and the mother the wife of the son, and so the daughter
became the mother-in-law of her own mother, and the mother became the
daughter-in-law of her own daughter. And in course of time, both of
them had by those husbands sons and daughters, and they also had sons
and daughters in due course of time. So Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and
Sinhapar&aacute;krama lived in their city, having obtained as wives
L&aacute;va&#7751;yavat&iacute; and Chandravat&iacute;.</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had told this story on the way at night, he
again put a question to king Trivikramasena; &ldquo;Now, king, about
the children who were in course of time born to the mother and daughter
by the son and the father in those two lines&mdash;what relationship
did they bear to one another? Tell me if you know. And the curse before
threatened will descend on you, if you know and do not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this question of the
Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s<span class="corr" id="xd27e10693" title=
"Source: .">,</span> he turned the matter over and over again in his
mind, but he could not find out, so he went on his way in silence. Then
the Vet&aacute;la in the dead man&rsquo;s body, perched on the top of
his shoulder, laughed to himself, and reflected; &ldquo;Ha! Ha! The
king does not know how to answer this puzzling question, so he is glad,
and silently goes on his way with very nimble feet. Now I cannot manage
to deceive this treasure-house of valour any further;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10696src" href="#xd27e10696" name="xd27e10696src">4</a> and
this is not enough to make that mendicant stop playing tricks with me.
So I will now deceive that villain, and by an artifice bestow the
success, which he has earned, upon this king, whom a glorious future
awaits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had gone through these reflections, he said
to the king, &ldquo;King, though you have been worried with so many
journeys to and fro in this cemetery terrible with black night, you
seem quite happy, and you do not shew the least irresolution. I am
pleased with this wonderful courage that you shew.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10705src" href="#xd27e10705" name="xd27e10705src">5</a> So now
carry off this body, for I am going out of it; and listen to this
advice which I give you for your welfare, and act on it. That wicked
mendicant, for whom you have fetched this human corpse, will
immediately summon me into it, and honour me. And wishing to offer you
up as a victim, the rascal will say to you, &lsquo;King, prostrate
yourself on the ground in such a way that eight limbs will touch
it.&rsquo; Then, great king, you must say to that ascetic,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10721src" href="#xd27e10721" name=
"xd27e10721src">6</a> &lsquo;Shew me first how to do it, and then I
will do exactly as you do.&rsquo; Then he will fling himself on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>ground, and shew you how to perform the
prostration, and that moment you must cut off his head with the sword.
Then you will obtain that prize which he desires, the sovereignty of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas; enjoy this earth by sacrificing him! But
otherwise that mendicant will offer you up as a victim; it was to
prevent this that I threw obstacles in your way for such a long time
here. So depart; may you prosper!&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la had
said this, he went out of that human corpse, that was on the
king&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Then the king was led by the speech of the Vet&aacute;la, who was
pleased with him, to look upon the ascetic
Ksh&aacute;nti&#347;&iacute;la as his enemy, but he went to him in high
spirits, where he sat under that <i>banyan</i>-tree, and took with him
that human corpse.</p>

<p>So the king came up to him, and the mendicant, seeing that he had
brought the corpse, rose up delighted, and said, praising him;
&ldquo;Great king, you have conferred on me a favour difficult to
accomplish. To think that one like you should undertake this enterprise
in such a place and at such a time! Indeed they say with truth that you
are the best of all noble kings, being a man of unbending
courage,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10759src" href="#xd27e10759" name=
"xd27e10759src">3</a> since you forward the interests of another with
such utter disregard of self. And wise men say that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>greatness of great ones consists in this very
thing, that they swerve not from what they have engaged to do, even
though their lives are in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the mendicant, thinking he had gained his end, took
the corpse down from the shoulder of that king. And he bathed it, and
anointed it, and threw a garland round it, and placed it within that
circle. And he smeared his limbs with ashes, and put on a sacrificial
thread of hair, and clothed himself in the garments of the dead, and
thus equipped he continued for a time in meditation. Then the mendicant
summoned that mighty Vet&aacute;la by the power of spells, and made him
enter the corpse; and proceeded to worship him. He offered to him an
<i>argha</i> of white human teeth in a skull by way of an
<i>argha</i>-vessel; and he presented to him flowers and fragrant
unguents; and he gratified him with the savoury reek of human
eyes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10787src" href="#xd27e10787" name=
"xd27e10787src">4</a> and made an offering to him of human flesh. And
when he had finished his worship, he said to the king, who was at his
side, &ldquo;King, fall on the ground, and do obeisance with all your
eight limbs to this high sovereign of spells who has appeared here, in
order that this bestower of boons may grant you the accomplishment of
your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard that, he called to mind the words of the
Vet&aacute;la, and said to the mendicant, &ldquo;I do not know how to
do it, reverend sir; do you shew me first, and then I will do exactly
as you.&rdquo; Then the mendicant threw himself on the ground, to shew
the king what he was to do, and then the king cut off his head with a
stroke of his sword. And he tore and dragged<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10798src" href="#xd27e10798" name="xd27e10798src">5</a> the lotus
of his heart out of his inside, and offered his heart and head as two
lotuses to that Vet&aacute;la.</p>
<p>Then the delighted hosts of goblins uttered shouts of applause on
every side, and the Vet&aacute;la said to the king from inside the
corpse, &ldquo;King, the sovereignty of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, which
this mendicant was aiming at, shall fall to your lot after you have
finished the enjoyment of your earthly sway. Since I have given you
much annoyance, choose whatever boon you desire.&rdquo; When the
Vet&aacute;la said this, the king said to him, &ldquo;Since you are
pleased with me, every boon that I could desire is obtained;
nevertheless, as your words cannot be uttered in vain, I crave this
boon of you:&mdash;may these first twenty-four questions and answers,
charming with their various tales, and this conclusion, the
twenty-fifth of the series, be all famous and honoured on the
earth!&rdquo; When the king made this request to the Vet&aacute;la, the
latter replied, &ldquo;So be it! and now listen, king; I am going to
mention a peculiar excellence which it shall possess. This string of
tales, consisting of the twenty-four first, and this final concluding
tale, shall become, under the title of the Twenty-five Tales of a
Vampire, famous and honoured on the earth, as conducing to prosperity!
Whosoever shall read <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360"
name="pb360">360</a>]</span>respectfully even a <i>&#347;loka</i> of
it, or whosoever shall hear it read, even they two shall immediately be
freed from their curse. And Yakshas, and Vet&aacute;las, and
Kushm&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;as, and witches, and R&aacute;kshasas, and
other creatures of the kind shall have no power where this shall be
recited.&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la had said this, he left that
human corpse, and went by his supernatural deluding power to the
habitation he desired.</p>
<p>Then &#346;iva, being pleased, appeared, accompanied by all the
gods, to that king, visibly manifest, and said to him, as he bowed
before him; &ldquo;Bravo! my son, for that thou hast to-day slain this
hypocritical ascetic, who was so ardently in love with the imperial
sovereignty over the Vidy&aacute;dharas! I originally created thee out
of a portion of myself, as Vikram&aacute;ditya, in order that thou
mightest destroy the Asuras, that had become incarnate in the form of
Mlechchhas. And now thou hast again been created by me as a heroic king
of the name of Trivikramasena, in order that thou mightest overcome an
audacious evildoer. So thou shalt bring under thy sway the earth with
the islands and the realms below, and shalt soon become supreme ruler
over the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And after thou hast long enjoyed heavenly
pleasures, thou shalt become melancholy, and shalt of thy own will
abandon them, and shalt at last without fail be united with me. Now
receive from me this sword named Invincible, by means of which thou
shalt duly obtain all this.&rdquo; When the god &#346;iva had said this
to the king, he gave him that splendid sword, and disappeared after he
had been worshipped by him with devout speeches and flowers. Then king
Trivikramasena, seeing that the whole business was finished, and as the
night had come to an end, entered his own city
Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na. There he was honoured by his rejoicing
subjects, who in course of time came to hear of his exploits during the
night, and he spent the whole of that day in bathing, giving gifts, in
worshipping &#346;iva, in dancing, singing, music, and other enjoyments
of the kind. And in a few days that king, by the power of the sword of
&#346;iva, came to enjoy the earth, that was cleared of all enemies,
together with the islands and the lower regions; and then by the
appointment of &#346;iva he obtained the high imperial sovereignty over
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and after enjoying it long, at last became
united with the blessed one, so attaining all his ends.</p>
<p>(<i>Here ends the Vet&aacute;lapanchavin&#347;ati.</i>)</p>
<p>When<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10820src" href="#xd27e10820" name=

M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, after he had been long separated from him
by a curse, had told him all this, he went on to say to him, &ldquo;So,
prince, after that old Br&aacute;hman had told me in that village this
story, called the Twenty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361"
href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>Tales of a Vampire, he went
on to say to me, &lsquo;Well, my son, did not that heroic king
Trivikramasena obtain from the favour of a Vet&aacute;la the thing that
he desired? So do you also receive from me this spell, and laying aside
your state of despondency, win over a chief among the Vet&aacute;las,
in order that you may obtain reunion with prince
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta. For nothing is unattainable by those who
possess endurance; who, my son, will not fail, if he allows his
endurance to break down? So do what I recommend you to do out of
affection; for you kindly delivered me from the pain of the bite of a
poisonous serpent.&rsquo; When the Br&aacute;hman said this, I received
from him the spell with the practice to be employed with it, and then,
king, I took leave of him, and went to Ujjayin&iacute;. There I got
hold of a corpse in the cemetery at night, and I washed it, and
performed all the other necessary processes with regard to it, and I
summoned a Vet&aacute;la into it by means of that spell, and duly
worshipped him. And to satisfy his hunger, I gave him human flesh to
eat; and being greedy for the flesh of men, he ate that up quickly, and
then said to me; &lsquo;I am not satisfied with this; give me some
more.&rsquo; And as he would not wait any time, I cut off my own
flesh,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10831src" href="#xd27e10831" name=
"xd27e10831src">8</a> and gave it to him to please him: and that made
that prince of magicians exceedingly pleased with me. Then he said to
me, &lsquo;My friend, I am much pleased now with this intrepid valour
of thine, so become whole in thy limbs as thou wast before, and crave
from me whatever boon thou desirest.&rsquo; When the Vet&aacute;la said
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10846" title=
"Source: this this">this</span> to me, I answered him then and there:
&lsquo;Convey me, god, to that place where my master
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta is; there is no other boon which I desire
more than this.&rsquo; Then the mighty Vet&aacute;la said to me;
&lsquo;Then quickly get up on my shoulder, that I may carry thee
rapidly to that master of thine.&rsquo; When the Vet&aacute;la said
this, I consented, and eagerly climbed up on his shoulder, and then the
Vet&aacute;la, that was inside that human corpse, rapidly set out
through the air, carrying me with him. And he has brought me here
to-day, king, and when that mighty Vet&aacute;la saw you on the way, he
brought me down from the air, and thus I have been made to reach the
sole of your foot. And I have to-day been reunited with my master, and
the Vet&aacute;la has departed, having accomplished what was required
of him. This, O bestower of honour,<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Then, the story being ended, the delighted
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta rose up from the middle of the path, and set
out again for Ujjayin&iacute; for which he had long ago started in
order to find <span class="corr" id="xd27e10891" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>,
with a party of eight, including himself, having recovered
Vikramake&#347;arin, accompanied by Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and
Vimalabuddhi, and Vichitrakatha, and Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, and
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti, and the Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi,
and he kept looking out for those of his companions separated from him
by the curse of the N&aacute;ga, whom he had not yet recovered.</p>
<p>And in course of time, he reached a treeless desert, all the water
in which had been dried up by the heat, and which was full of sand
heated by the fierce blaze of the sun. And as the prince was traversing
it, he said to his ministers, &ldquo;Observe how long, terrible, and
difficult to cross is this great desert; for it has in it no refuge, it
is pathless and abandoned by men; and the blaze of its fire of grief
seems to ascend in these sandy mirages; its rough and dishevelled locks
are represented by the dry rustling blades of grass; and its thorns
make it appear to have its hair standing on end through fear of the
lions, tigers, and other noisome beasts; and it laments in the cries of
its deer exhausted by the heat and longing for water. So we must cross
this terrible desert as quickly as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had said this, he quickly crossed
that desert with his ministers, who were afflicted with hunger and
thirst. And he beheld in front of him a great lake filled with pellucid
and cold water, looking like streams that had flowed down from the moon
after it had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363"
name="pb363">363</a>]</span>melted with the heat of the sun. It was so
broad that it filled the whole horizon, and it looked like a
jewel-mirror made by the Fortune of the three worlds, in order to
behold in it the reflection of herself. That lake resembled the
Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, for in it the
Dh&aacute;rtar&aacute;sh&#7789;ras<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10900src"
href="#xd27e10900" name="xd27e10900src">2</a> were making a
disturbance, and many Arjuna trees were reflected;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e10903src" href="#xd27e10903" name="xd27e10903src">3</a> and it
was refreshing and sweet to the taste; it was like the churned sea of
doom, for its precious fluid was drunk by the blue-necked jays that
assembled near it,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10906src" href=
"#xd27e10906" name="xd27e10906src">4</a> and Vish&#7751;u might have
resorted to it to find the goddess of Beauty:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10909src" href="#xd27e10909" name="xd27e10909src">5</a> it
resembled an earthly P&aacute;t&aacute;la, for its profound cool depths
were never reached by the rays of the sun, and it was an unfailing
receptacle of lotuses.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10913src" href=
"#xd27e10913" name="xd27e10913src">6</a></p>
<p>And on the western shore of that lake the prince and his ministers
saw a great and wonderful tree. Its numerous far-reaching boughs,
agitated by the wind, appeared like arms, and the cloud-stream that
clung to its head was like the Ganges, so that it resembled &#346;iva
dancing. With its lofty top, that pierced the sky, it seemed to be
standing erect out of curiosity to see the beauty of the garden
Nandana. It was adorned with fruit of heavenly flavour, that clung to
its branches, and so it looked like the wishing-tree of heaven, with
goblets of nectar suspended on it by the gods. It waved its shoots like
finger-tips, and seemed with the voices of its birds to say again and
again, &ldquo;Let no one question me in any way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While prince M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was looking at that tree,
his ministers, worn out with hunger and thirst, ran towards it, and the
moment they saw those fruits on it, they climbed up to eat them, and
immediately they lost their human form, and were all six suddenly
turned into fruits. Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was bewildered at
not seeing those friends of his, and he called on every one of them
there by name. But when they gave no answer, and could not be seen
anywhere, the prince exclaimed in a voice agonized with despair,
&ldquo;Alas! I am undone!&rdquo; and fell on the ground in a swoon. And
the Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi, who had not climbed up the tree, was
the only one left at his side.</p>
<p>So the Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi at once said to him by way of
consolation, &ldquo;Why, my sovereign, do you lose your firmness, and
despair, though you have learned wisdom? For it is the man, who is not
distracted in calamity, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href=
"#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>that obtains prosperity. Did you
not find those ministers, after they had been separated from you by the
curse of the N&aacute;ga? In like manner shall you again recover them,
and get back the others also, and moreover you shall soon be united
with &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.&rdquo; When &#346;rutadhi
said this to the prince, he answered him; &ldquo;How can this be? The
truth is that all this train of events was arranged for our ruin by the
Disposer. If it was not so arranged, how came the Vet&aacute;la to
appear in the night, and Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama to do as he did,
and how came it to pass that I heard about
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; through the conversation that took
place between them, and that I set out from Ayodhy&aacute; to fetch
her? How came it to pass also that we were all separated from one
another in the Vindhya forest by the curse of the N&aacute;ga, and that
some of us were in course of time reunited, and that this second
separation has now taken place and with it the ruin of all my plans? It
all tallies together, my friend. The fact is they have been devoured in
that tree by a demon, and without them what is
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; to me, or what is my life worth to
me? So away with delusions?&rdquo; When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had
said this, he rose up to throw himself into the lake out of sorrow,
although &#346;rutadhi tried to prevent him.</p>
<p>At that moment a bodiless voice came from the air, &ldquo;My son, do
not act rashly, for all will end well for thee. The god
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a himself dwells in this tree, and he has been to-day
insulted by thy ministers unwittingly. For they, king, being pinched
with hunger, climbed up into the tree in which he dwells, to pick its
fruits, in a state of impurity, having neither rinsed their mouths nor
washed their hands and feet; so the moment that they touched the
fruits, they became fruits themselves. For Ga&#7751;e&#347;a inflicted
on them this curse, &lsquo;Let them become that on which their minds
are fixed?&rsquo; Moreover, thy four other ministers, who, the moment
they arrived here, climbed up the tree in the same way, were turned
into fruits by the god. Therefore do thou propitiate this
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a with ascetic practices, and by his favour thou shalt
attain all thy objects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had been thus addressed by the voice
from the air, that seemed to rain nectar into his ears, hope again
sprang up in his bosom, and he gave up all idea of suicide. So he
bathed in the lake, and worshipped Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, who dwelt in that
tree, without taking food, and joining his palms in an attitude of
supplication, praised him in the following words; &ldquo;Hail thou
elephant-faced lord, who art, as it were, worshipped by the earth, that
with its plains, rocks, and woods, bows under the crushing weight of
thy tumultuous dance! Hail thou that hast the twin lotuses of thy feet
worshipped by the three worlds, with the gods, Asuras, and men, that
dwell in them; thou, whose body is in shape like a pitcher for the
abundant storing of various splendid successes! Hail, thou, the flame
of whose might blazes forth like twelve <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>fierce suns rising at
once; thou that wast a premature day of doom to the race of the
Daityas, whom &#346;iva, Vish&#7751;u, and Indra found hard to conquer!
Hail, thou that wardest off calamity from thy votaries! Hail, thou that
diffusest a blaze of flame with thy hand, while it glitters with thy
mighty axe, that seems anxious to illuminate thee in sport! I fly for
refuge to thee, O Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, that wast worshipped even by
Gaur&iacute;, in order that her husband might successfully accomplish
his undertaking in the conquest of Tripura; honour to thee!&rdquo; When
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had in these words praised
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, he spent that night fasting, on a bed of
<i>ku&#347;a</i>-grass under that tree. In the same way that prince
spent eleven nights, being engaged in propitiating Ga&#7751;e&#347;a,
the king of impediments; and &#346;rutadhi remained in attendance on
him.</p>
<p>And on the night of the twelfth day Ga&#7751;e&#347;a said to him in
a dream, &ldquo;My son, I am pleased with thee; thy ministers shall be
released from their curse, and thou shalt recover them; and with them
thou shalt go and win &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; in due
course; and thou shalt return to thy own city, and rule the whole
earth.&rdquo; After M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had been thus informed
in a dream by the god Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, he woke up, when the night
came to an end, and told &#346;rutadhi the vision that he had seen.
&#346;rutadhi congratulated him on it; and then, in the morning, the
prince bathed and worshipped Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and proceeded to walk
round the tree in which the god dwelt, with his right hand towards
it,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10935src" href="#xd27e10935" name=
"xd27e10935src">7</a> and while he was thus engaged, all his ten
ministers came down from the tree, having been released from the form
of fruits, and fell at his feet. Besides the six who were mentioned
before, there were Vy&aacute;ghrasena and Sth&uacute;lab&aacute;hu, and
Meghabala, and the fourth D&#7771;i&#7693;hamush&#7789;i.</p>
<p>Then the prince, having recovered all those ministers at the same
instant, with eye, with gestures,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10941src"
href="#xd27e10941" name="xd27e10941src">8</a> and with voice agitated
by the workings of joy, looked at his ministers, one by one, again and
again, exceedingly lovingly, and embraced them, and then spoke to them;
having successfully attained his object. And they, beholding with tears
in their eyes their master, who, after the asceticism which he had gone
through, was slender as a new moon, and having been told the true
explanation of the whole by &#346;rutadhi, felicitated themselves on
having truly a protecting lord.</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, having attained good hope of
accomplishing his enterprise, joyfully broke his fast with those
ministers, who had performed all necessary ablutions in the tank.

<p class="first">Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, refreshed by breaking
his fast, sat down with those ministers of his on the bank of that
lake. Then he courteously asked those four ministers, whom he had
recovered that day, for an account of their adventures during the time
that he was separated from them. Thereupon that one of them, who was
called Vy&aacute;ghrasena, said to him, &ldquo;Listen, prince, I now
proceed to relate our adventures. When I was carried to a distance from
you by the curse of the N&aacute;ga P&aacute;r&aacute;vat&aacute;ksha,
I lost my senses, and in that state I wandered through the forest by
night. At last I recovered consciousness, but the darkness, which
enveloped me, prevented me from seeing where the cardinal points lay,
and what path I ought to take. At last the night, that grief made
long,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10959src" href="#xd27e10959" name=
"xd27e10959src">1</a> came to an end; and in course of time the sun
arose, that mighty god, and revealed all the quarters of the heaven.
Then I said to myself &lsquo;Alas! Where can that master of mine be
gone? And how will he manage to exist here alone separated from us? And
how am I to recover him? Where shall I look for him? What course shall
I adopt? I had better go to Ujjayin&iacute;; for I may perhaps find him
there; for he must go there, to find
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.&rsquo; With such hopes I set out
slowly for Ujjayin&iacute;, threading that difficult forest that
resembled calamity, scorched by the rays of the sun, that resembled
showers of fiery powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at last, somehow or other, I reached a lake, with
full-blown lotuses for expanded eyes, that seemed to hold converse with
me by means of the sweet cries of its swans and other water-birds; it
stretched forth its ripples like hands; its surface was calm and
broad;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10970src" href="#xd27e10970" name=
"xd27e10970src">2</a> the very sight of it took away all grief; and so
in all points it resembled a good man. I bathed in it, and ate
lotus-fibres, and drank water; and while I was lingering on its bank, I
saw these three arrive there, D&#7771;i&#7693;hamush&#7789;i, and
Sth&uacute;lab&aacute;hu, and Meghabala. And when we met, we asked one
another for tidings of you. And as none of us knew anything about you,
and we suspected the worst, we made up our minds to abandon the body,
being unable to endure separation from you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at that moment a hermit-boy came to bathe in that lake;
his name was Mah&aacute;tapas, and he was the son of
D&iacute;rghatapas. He had matted hair, he diffused a brightness of his
own, and he seemed like the god of Fire, blazing with mighty flame,
having become incarnate in the body of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>a Br&aacute;hman, in
order to consume once more the Kh&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;ava
forest;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10977src" href="#xd27e10977" name=
"xd27e10977src">3</a> he was clothed in the skin of a black antelope,
he had an ascetic&rsquo;s water-vessel in his left hand, and on his
right wrist he bore a rosary of <i>Aksha</i>-seeds by way of a
bracelet; the perfumed earth that he used in bathing was stuck on the
horns of the deer that came with him, and he was accompanied by some
other hermit-boys like himself<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> The moment he saw us about to throw ourselves into
the lake, he came towards us; for the good are easily melted with
compassion, and shew causeless friendship to all. And he said to us,
&lsquo;You ought not to commit a crime characteristic of cowards, for
poltroons, with their minds blinded with grief, fall into the gulfs of
calamity, but resolute men, having eyes enlightened by discernment,
behold the right path, and do not fall into the pit, but assuredly
attain their goal. And you, being men of auspicious appearance, will no
doubt attain prosperity; so tell me, what is your grief? For it grieves
my heart to see you thus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the hermit-boy had said this, I at once told him the
whole of our adventure from the beginning; then that boy, who could
read the future,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10988src" href=
"#xd27e10988" name="xd27e10988src">4</a> and his companions, exhorted
us with various speeches, and diverted our minds from suicide. Then the
hermit-boy, after he had bathed, took us to his father&rsquo;s
hermitage, which was at no great distance, to entertain us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There that hermit&rsquo;s son bestowed on us the
<i>arghya</i>, and made us sit down in a place, in which even the trees
seemed to have entered on a course of penance, for they stood aloft on
platforms of earth, and lifted on high their branches like arms, and
drank in the rays of the sun. And then he went and asked all the trees
in the hermitage, one after another, for alms. And in a moment his
alms-vessel was filled with fruits, that of themselves dropped from the
trees; and he came back with it to us. And he gave us those fruits of
heavenly flavour, and when we had eaten them, we became, as it were,
satisfied with nectar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the day came to an end, and the sun descended into
the sea, and the sky was filled with stars, as if with spray flung up
by his fall, and the moon, having put on a white bark-robe of
moonlight, had gone to the ascetic grove on the top of the eastern
mountain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11001src" href="#xd27e11001" name=
"xd27e11001src">5</a> as if desiring to withdraw from the world on
account of the fall of the sun, we went to see the hermits, who had
finished all their duties, and were sitting together in a certain part
of the hermitage. We bowed before them, and sat down, and those great
sages welcomed us, and with kindly words at once asked us whence we
came. Then that hermit-boy told them our history until the time of our
entering the hermitage. Then a wise hermit there, of the name of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>Kanva, said to us, &lsquo;Come, why have you
allowed yourselves to become so dispirited, being, as you are, men of
valour? For it is the part of a brave man to display unbroken firmness
in calamity, and freedom from arrogance in success, and never to
abandon fortitude. And great men attain the title of great by
struggling through great difficulties by the aid of resolution, and
accomplishing great things. In illustration of this, listen to this
story of Sundarasena, and hear how he endured hardship for the sake of
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;?&rsquo; When the hermit Kanva had said this,
he began, in the hearing of us and of all the hermits, to tell the
following tale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Sundarasena and
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a country named Nishada, that adorns the face
of the northern quarter; in it there was of old a city of the name of
Alak&aacute;. In this city the people were always happy in abundance of
all things,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11014src" href="#xd27e11014"
name="xd27e11014src">6</a> and the only things that never enjoyed
repose were the jewel-lamps. In it there lived a king of the name of
Mah&aacute;sena, and not without reason was he so named, for his
enemies were all consumed by the wonderful and terrible fire of his
valour, which resembled that of the god of war. That king had a prime
minister named Gu&#7751;ap&aacute;lita, who was like a second
&#346;esha, for he was a mine of valour, and could bear up, like that
serpent, the weight of the earth. The king, having destroyed his
enemies, laid upon him the weight of his kingdom and devoted himself to
pleasure; and then he had a son born to him by his queen <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e11020" title=
"Source: &#346;asiprabh&aacute;">&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;</span>,
named Sundarasena. Even when he was a child, he was no child in good
qualities, and the goddesses of valour and beauty chose him for their
self-elected husband.</p>
<p>That prince had five heroic ministers, equal in age and
accomplishments, who had grown up with him from their childhood,
Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha, and Bh&iacute;mabhuja, and
Vy&aacute;ghrapar&aacute;krama, and the heroic Vikrama&#347;akti, and
the fifth was <span class="corr" id="xd27e11025" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>. And they
were all men of great courage, endowed with strength and wisdom,
well-born, and devoted to their master, and they even understood the
cries of birds.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11028src" href="#xd27e11028"
name="xd27e11028src">7</a> And the prince lived with them in his
father&rsquo;s house without a suitable wife, being unmarried, though
he was grown up. And that heroic Sundarasena and his ministers
reflected, &ldquo;Courage invincible in assault, and wealth won by his
own arm, and a wife equal to him in beauty become a hero on this earth.
Otherwise, what is the use of this beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one day the prince went out of the town to hunt, accompanied by
his soldiers, and by those five companions, and as he was going out, a
certain famous female mendicant named K&aacute;ty&aacute;yan&iacute;,
bold from the maturity of her age, who had just returned from a distant
foreign country, saw him, and said to herself, when she beheld his
superhuman beauty, &ldquo;Is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>this the Moon without
Rohi&#7751;&iacute; or the god of Love without Rati?&rdquo; But when
she asked his attendants, and found out that it was the prince, she was
astonished, and praised the marvellousness of the creation of the
Disposer.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11038src" href="#xd27e11038" name=
"xd27e11038src">8</a> Then she cried out to the prince from a distance
with a shrill and far reaching voice, &ldquo;Be victorious, O
prince,&rdquo; and so saying she bowed before him. But at that moment
the mind of the prince was wholly occupied by a conversation which he
had begun with his ministers, and he went on without hearing the female
ascetic. But she was angry, and called out to him in such a loud voice
that he could not help hearing her, &ldquo;Ho! prince! why do you not
listen to the blessing of such a one as I am? What king or prince is
there on the earth that does not honour me?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11050src" href="#xd27e11050" name="xd27e11050src">9</a> But if
your youth and other advantages render you so proud now, it is certain
that, if you obtain for a wife that ornament of the world, the maiden
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, the daughter of the king of
Hansadv&iacute;pa, you will be too much puffed up with arrogance to
listen to the speech of &#346;iva,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11053src"
href="#xd27e11053" name="xd27e11053src">10</a> the great Indra, and
other gods, much less to the words of wretched men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ascetic had said this, Sundarasena, being full of
curiosity, called her to him, and bent before her and propitiated her.
And being anxious to question her, he sent her under the care of his
servants to rest in the house of his minister Vikrama&#347;akti. Then
the prince went off, and after he had enjoyed the sport of hunting, he
returned to his palace, and said his daily prayers, and took his food,
and then he sent for the ascetic, and put the following question to
her, &ldquo;Reverend mother, who is this maiden named
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, that you spoke of to-day? Tell me, for I
feel great curiosity about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ascetic heard this, she said to him, &ldquo;Listen, I will
tell you the whole story. I am in the habit of wandering about the
whole of this earth and the islands, for the sake of visiting sacred
bathing-places and other holy spots. And in the course of my travels I
happened to visit Hansadv&iacute;pa. There I saw the daughter of king
Mand&aacute;radeva, a suitable match for the sons of gods, not to be
beheld by those who have done evil works; she bears the name of
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and has a form as charming as the presiding
goddess of the garden of the gods; the sight of her kindles love, and
she seems like another moon all composed of nectar, created by the
Disposer. There is no other beauty on the earth equal to hers;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11066src" href="#xd27e11066" name=
"xd27e11066src">11</a> only you, prince, I think, emulate her wealth of
loveliness. As for those who have not seen her, their eyes are useless,
and they have been born in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince heard this from the mouth of the female ascetic, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;Mother, how are we to get a sight
of her beauty, which is so surpassing?&rdquo; When the female ascetic
heard this speech of his, she said, &ldquo;I took such interest in her
on that occasion that I painted a picture of her on <span class="corr"
id="xd27e11079" title="Source: canvass">canvas</span>; and I have it
with me in a bag; if you feel any curiosity about it, look at
it.&rdquo; When she had said this, she took the picture of the lady out
of the bag, and shewed it to the gratified prince. And Sundarasena,
when he beheld that maiden, who, though she was present there only in a
picture, seemed to be of romantic beauty, and like a flowing forth of
joy, immediately felt his limbs covered all over with hairs erect from
horripilation, as if he had been pierced with the dense arrows of the
god of the flowery bow.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11082src" href=
"#xd27e11082" name="xd27e11082src">12</a> He remained motionless,
hearing nothing, speaking nothing, seeing nothing; and with his whole
heart fixed on her, was for a long time as if painted in a picture.</p>
<p>When the prince&rsquo;s ministers saw that, they said to that female
ascetic, &ldquo;Reverend mother, paint prince Sundarasena on this piece
of <span class="corr" id="xd27e11099" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>, and let us have a specimen of your
skill in catching likenesses.&rdquo; The moment she heard that, she
painted the prince on <span class="corr" id="xd27e11102" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>. And when they saw that it was a
striking likeness, all, who were present there, said, &ldquo;The
reverend lady&rsquo;s likenesses exactly resemble the originals, for
when one looks at this picture, one thinks that one sees the prince
himself; so the beauty of the princess Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; is
sure to be such as it is represented in the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ministers had said this<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> prince Sundarasena took the two pictures, and
being pleased, honoured that female ascetic. And he dismissed with
appropriate honours that dweller in a lonely spot. And he entered the
inner part of the palace, carrying with him the picture of his beloved.
He flung himself on a bed and said to himself &ldquo;Can this be my
charmer&rsquo;s face, or a moon that has purged away the spot that
defiles its beauty?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11110src" href=
"#xd27e11110" name="xd27e11110src">13</a> In this way he remained
examining Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, limb by limb, though he had only
her painted form before him: and in this state he continued every day,
abstaining from meat and drink; and so in the course of a few days he
was completely exhausted by the pain of love&rsquo;s fever.</p>
<p>When his parents, &#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute; and Mah&aacute;sena,
found that out, they came of their own accord and asked his friends the
cause of his indisposition. And his companions told them the whole
story, as it had happened, how the daughter of the king of
Hansadv&iacute;pa had come to be the cause of his complaint. Then
Mah&aacute;sena said to Sundarasena, &ldquo;My son, why do you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>so improperly conceal this attachment of yours?
For Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; is a pearl of maidens, and she will be a
good match for you. Besides, her father Mand&aacute;radeva is a great
friend of mine. So why do you torment yourself about a matter of this
kind, which is quite becoming, and can be easily arranged by an
ambassador?&rdquo; When king Mah&aacute;sena had said this, he
deliberated, and sent off an ambassador named Surathadeva to
Hansadv&iacute;pa, to ask for the daughter of king Mand&aacute;radeva.
And he put into his hand the portrait of Sundarasena, executed on
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11117" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span> by that female ascetic, which shewed
how wonderfully handsome he was.</p>
<p>The ambassador travelled quickly, and reached the city of king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya on the shore of the sea, named
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura. There he embarked on a ship, and after
some days he reached the palace of king Mand&aacute;radeva in
Hansadv&iacute;pa. He was announced by the wardens and entered the
palace, and saw that king, and after he had in due form delivered to
him the present, he said to him, &ldquo;Great monarch, king
Mah&aacute;sena sends you this message, &lsquo;Give your daughter to my
son Sundarasena; for a female ascetic, of the name of
K&aacute;ty&aacute;yan&iacute;, made a portrait of her, and brought it
here, and shewed it to my son, as the picture of a pearl of maidens.
And as Sundarasena&rsquo;s beauty so nearly resembled hers, I felt a
desire to have his form painted on <span class="corr" id="xd27e11122"
title="Source: canvass">canvas</span> also, and herewith I send the
picture. Look at it. Moreover, my son, who is of such astonishing
beauty, does not wish to be married, unless he can find a wife that
resembles him, and nobody but your daughter is a match for him in
appearance.&rsquo; This is the message the king entrusted to me, when
he put this portrait into my hand; look at it, king, let the
spring-flower creeper be united to the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this speech of the ambassador&rsquo;s, he was
delighted, and he sent for his daughter Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; and
the queen her mother. And in their company he opened and looked at that
portrait, and immediately he ceased to cherish the proud thought, that
there was no fitting match for his daughter on the earth. And he
said<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;My
daughter&rsquo;s beauty will not have been created in vain, if she is
united to this prince. She does not look her best without him, nor is
he complete without her; what is the lotus-bed without the swan, and
what is the swan without the lotus-bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this, and the queen expressed her complete
approbation of it, Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; suddenly became bewildered
with love. She remained with her wide expanded eyes immoveably fixed on
the picture, as if possessed, as if asleep, (though she was wide
awake,) as if herself a painting. Then Mand&aacute;radeva, seeing his
daughter in that state, consented to give her in marriage, and he
honoured that ambassador.</p>
<p>And on the next day the king sent off his counter-ambassador, who
was a Br&aacute;hman named Kum&aacute;radatta, to king Mah&aacute;sena.
And he said to the two ambassadors, &ldquo;Go quickly to that king
Mah&aacute;sena, the lord of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=
"#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>Alak&aacute;, and say to him from
me, &lsquo;I give you my daughter out of friendship; so tell me, will
your son come here, or shall I send my daughter to
you?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the two ambassadors had received this
message from the king, they immediately started off together on the sea
in a ship; and they reached &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura, and thence
they travelled by land, and reached that opulent city of Alak&aacute;,
which seemed like the original Alak&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11137src" href="#xd27e11137" name="xd27e11137src">14</a> They
went to the king&rsquo;s palace, and entered it with the usual
courtesies, and saw king Mah&aacute;sena who welcomed them. And they
told that king the answer which Mand&aacute;radeva entrusted to them;
and when the king heard it, he was pleased, and shewed both of them
great honour.</p>
<p>Then the king found out the star, under which the princess was born,
from her father&rsquo;s ambassador; and he asked his astrologers when a
favourable time would arrive for the marriage of his son. And they
answered that an auspicious time would present itself in three months
for bridegroom and bride, on the fifth day of the white fortnight of
the month K&aacute;rtika. And so the king of Alak&aacute; informed
Mand&aacute;radeva that the marriage ought to take place on that day,
and that he would send his son, and this he wrote in a letter, and
committed it to the care of the ambassador Kum&aacute;radatta, and
another ambassador of his own named Chandrasv&aacute;min. So the
ambassadors departed, and gave the letter as they were directed, and
told the king of Hansadv&iacute;pa all that had taken place. The king
approved, and after honouring Chandrasv&aacute;min, the ambassador of
Mah&aacute;sena, he sent him back to his master. And he returned to
Alak&aacute;, and reported that the business was satisfactorily
settled; and then all on both sides remained eagerly expecting the
auspicious day.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; in Hansadv&iacute;pa,
who had long ago fallen in love with the prince from seeing his
picture, thought that the auspicious day for the marriage was a long
way off, and felt unable to endure so much delay; and being
affectionate, she became desperately enamoured, and was grievously
tormented with the fire of love. And in the eager longing of her heart
for Sundarasena, even the anointing with sandal-wood ointment became a
shower of hot coals on her body, and a bed of lotus-leaves was to her a
bed of hot sand, and the rays of the moon seemed like the scorching
points of flame of a forest conflagration. She remained silent,
avoiding food, adopting a vow of loneliness; and when her confidante
questioned her in her anxiety, she was at last, with difficulty,
induced to make the following avowal; &ldquo;My friend, my marriage is
far off, and I cannot bear to wait for the time, separated from my
intended husband, the son of the king of Alak&aacute;. Distant is the
time, and the place, and various is the course of Fate; so who knows
what will happen to any one here in the meantime? So I had better
die.&rdquo; Saying this, Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, being sick with
separation, passed immediately into a miserable state. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>When her father and mother heard that from the mouth of her
confidante, and saw her in such a condition, they deliberated with the
ministers, and came to the following conclusion, &ldquo;That king
Mah&aacute;sena, the sovereign of Alak&aacute;, is on good terms with
us, and the princess Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; is unable to endure the
delay here, so why should we feel any delicacy about it? Happen what
will, let us send her to Alak&aacute;, for when she is near her
beloved, she will be able patiently to endure the delay.&rdquo; When
king Mand&aacute;radeva had gone through these deliberations, he
comforted his daughter Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and made her embark
on a ship with wealth and attendants, and after her mother had recited
a prayer for her good fortune, he sent her off from Hansadv&iacute;pa
by sea on an auspicious day, to travel to Alak&aacute;, in order that
she might be married there; and he sent with her a minister of his own,
named Vin&iacute;tamati.</p>
<p>And after the princess, travelling in a ship on the ocean, had left
Hansadv&iacute;pa some days&rsquo; sail behind her, there suddenly rose
up against her a roaring cloud, as it were a bandit, showering
raindrops like arrows, that sang terribly in the whistling wind. And
the gale, like mighty fate, in a moment dragged her ship to a distance,
and smote it, and broke it in pieces. And those attendants were
drowned, and among them Vin&iacute;tamati; and all her treasure was
whelmed in the ocean.</p>
<p>But the sea lifted up the princess with a wave, as it were with an
arm, and flung her up alive in a forest on the shore, near the scene of
the shipwreck. To think that she should have fallen into the sea, and
that a towering wave should have landed her in a forest! Behold now,
how nothing is impossible to Destiny! Then she, in such a situation,
terrified and confused, seeing that she was alone in a solitary wood,
was again plunged in a sea, but this time it was the sea of grief. She
exclaimed, &ldquo;Where have I arrived? Surely it is a very different
place from that for which I set out! Where too are those attendants of
mine? Where is Vin&iacute;tamati? Why has this suddenly happened to me?
Where shall I go, ill-starred as I am? Alas! I am undone! What shall I
do? Cursed Fate, why did you rescue me from the sea? Ah! father! Ah,
mother! Ah, husband, son of the king of Alak&aacute;! Look; I am
perishing before I reach you; why do you not deliver me?&rdquo; While
uttering these and similar exclamations, Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; wept
copiously with tears that resembled the pearls of a broken
necklace.</p>
<p>And at that very time a hermit, named Matanga, came there from his
hermitage, which was not far off, to bathe in the sea. That sage, who
was accompanied by his daughter, named Yamun&aacute;, who had observed
a vow of virginity from her childhood, heard the sound of
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;&rsquo;s weeping. And with his daughter he
approached her kindly, and he saw her, looking like a doe separated
from a herd of deer, casting her sorrowing eyes in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>every direction. And the great sage said to her
with an affectionate voice, &ldquo;Who are you, and how did you get
into this wood, and why do you weep?&rdquo; Then
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, seeing that he was a compassionate man,
slowly recovered herself, and told him her story, with face dejected
from shame.</p>
<p>Then the hermit Matanga, after meditating, said to her,
&ldquo;Princess, cease to despair; recover your composure! Though you
are delicate of body as a <i>&#347;ir&iacute;sha</i>-flower, the
calamity of sorrow afflicts you; do misfortunes ever consider whether
their victim is tender or not? But you shall soon obtain the husband
you desire; so come to this hermitage of mine, which is at no great
distance from this place; and remain there with this daughter of mine
as in your own house.&rdquo; When the great hermit had comforted her
with these words, he bathed, and accompanied by his daughter, led
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; to his hermitage. There she remained leading
an ascetic life, longing to meet her husband, delighting herself with
waiting upon that sage, accompanied by his daughter.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Sundarasena, who was emaciated with long
expectation, remained killing the time in Alak&aacute;, continually
counting the days, eager for his marriage with
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and his friend Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha and
the rest were trying to console him. And in course of time, as the
auspicious day drew nigh, his father, the king, made preparations for
his journey to Hansadv&iacute;pa. And after prayers had been offered
for a prosperous journey, prince Sundarasena started from his home on
an auspicious day, shaking the earth with his armies.</p>
<p>And as he was marching along with his ministers, he reached in
course of time, to his delight, that city &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura,
which adorned the shore of the sea. There king Mahendr&aacute;ditya,
hearing of his approach, came to meet him, bowing humbly, and the
prince entered the city with his followers, and mounted on an elephant,
he reached the palace of the king. And as he went along, the splendour
of his beauty fluttered the hearts of the ladies of the city, as the
hurricane flutters the lotus-bed. In the palace, king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya shewed him every attention, and promised to
accompany him: and so he rested there that day. And he spent the night
in such thoughts as these, &ldquo;Shall I ever get across the sea, and
win that blushing bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And next morning he left his army in that very city, and went with
king Mahendr&aacute;ditya to the shore of the sea<span class="corr"
title="Not in source">.</span> There he and his ministers, together
with that king, embarked on a large ship, that was well supplied with
food and water. And the prince made the small retinue, that he could
not help taking, embark on a second ship. Then the ship was let go, and
its flag fluttered in the wind, and those two kings, who were in it,
shaped their course towards the south-western quarter.</p>
<p>And after two or three days had passed, as they were sailing on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>sea, there suddenly arose a great hurricane. And
the ranges of forest on the shores of the sea shook to and fro, as if
in astonishment at the unprecedented character of the gale. And the
waters of the sea, inverted by the wind, were turned upside down, again
and again, as affections are by lapse of time. And an offering of
jewels was made to the sea accompanied by a loud cry of woe; and the
pilots let loose the sail and relaxed their efforts at the same time;
and all excitedly flung out very heavy stones on all sides, fastened by
chains, and flung away their hopes of life at the same time; and the
two vessels, driven to and fro by the waves, as elephants by
elephant-drivers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11174src" href=
"#xd27e11174" name="xd27e11174src">15</a> wandered about in the sea, as
if in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of a battle.</p>
<p>Then Sundarasena, beholding that, was moved from his seat, as if
from his self-command,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11188src" href=
"#xd27e11188" name="xd27e11188src">16</a> and said to king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya, &ldquo;It is through my demerits in former births
that this day of doom has suddenly come upon you. So I cannot endure to
witness it; I will fling myself into the sea.&rdquo; When the prince
had said this, he quickly girt his upper garment round his loins, and
flung himself then and there into the sea. And when his five friends,
Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha and the others, saw that, they too flung
themselves in, and Mahendr&aacute;ditya did the same. And while, having
recovered their presence of mind, they were swimming across the ocean,
they all went in different directions, being separated by the force of
the waves. And immediately the wind fell, and the sea became hushed and
calm, and bore the semblance of a good man whose wrath is
appeased.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11197src" href="#xd27e11197" name=
"xd27e11197src">17</a></p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Sundarasena, with whom was
D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi, found a ship that had been driven from
somewhere or other by the wind, and with that minister of his as his
only companion he climbed up on it, as it were on a second swing of
incertitude oscillating between rescue and destruction. Then, having
lost all courage, he drifted, not knowing his bearings, looking on the
whole world as made of water, confiding in his god: and the ship, which
was wafted along by a gentle and favourable breeze, as if by a deity,
carried him to the shore in three days. There it stuck fast, and he and
his companion sprang to shore and to a hope of life at the same
moment.</p>
<p>And when there, he recovered breath, and said to <span class="corr"
id="xd27e11204" title=
"Source: D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>;
&ldquo;I have escaped even from the sea, from the infernal regions,
though I went below; but since I have not been able to do so without
causing the death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376"
name="pb376">376</a>]</span>of my ministers Vikrama&#347;akti, and
Vy&aacute;ghrapar&aacute;krama, and Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha and
Bh&iacute;mabhuja, such fine fellows as they were, and also of king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya, who became without cause so good a friend to
me,&mdash;of all these,&mdash;how can I now live with honour?&rdquo;
When he said this, his minister D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi said to him,
&ldquo;Prince, recover your composure; I am persuaded that we shall
have good fortune; for they may perhaps make their way across the sea,
as we have done. Who can discern the mysterious way of
Destiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi was saying this and other things of
the same kind, two hermits came there to bathe. The good men, seeing
that the prince was despondent, came up to him, and asked him his
story, and said kindly to him; &ldquo;Wise sir, even the gods are not
able to alter the mighty influence of actions in a previous state of
existence, that bestow joy and sorrow. So a resolute man, who wishes to
take leave of sorrow, should practise right doing; for right doing is
the true remedy for it, not regrets, nor emaciation of the body. So
abandon despondency, and preserve your body by resolute endurance; as
long as the body is preserved, what object of human endeavour cannot be
attained? Moreover, you possess auspicious marks; you are certain to
enjoy prosperity.&rdquo; Saying this the hermits consoled him, and took
him to their hermitage.</p>
<p>And prince Sundarasena remained waiting there for some days,
accompanied by D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile his ministers Bh&iacute;mabhuja and
Vikrama&#347;akti, having swum across the sea, reached the shore in a
separate place. And hoping that perhaps the prince might have escaped
from the sea like themselves, they entered that great forest, and
searched for him bewildered with grief. And his other two ministers,
Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha and Vy&aacute;ghrapar&aacute;krama, and king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya, in the same way escaped from the sea, and
sorrowfully sought for Sundarasena, and when they did not find him,
were afflicted; and at last they found their ship unharmed and went to
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura. Then those two ministers, and the army
that had been left in that city, hearing what had happened,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11215src" href="#xd27e11215" name=
"xd27e11215src">18</a> went weeping to their own city Alak&aacute;. And
when they arrived without the prince, lamenting their loss, the
citizens wept, and one universal wail was heard in the city. When king
Mah&aacute;sena and his queen heard that news of their son, they were
in such a state that they would have died, if it were not that their
allotted term of life had not yet expired. And when the king and the
queen were bent on suicide, the ministers dissuaded them with various
speeches, which gave them reasons for entertaining hope. Then the king
remained in a temple of Svayambh&uacute;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11221src" href="#xd27e11221" name="xd27e11221src">19</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>outside the town, engaged in asceticism with his
attendants, enquiring for news of his son.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile king Mand&aacute;radeva, in Hansadv&iacute;pa,
heard the news of the shipwreck of his daughter, and of that of his
proposed son-in-law. And he also came to know that his
son-in-law&rsquo;s two ministers had arrived in Alak&aacute;, and that
king Mah&aacute;sena there was keeping himself alive by hope, being
engaged in practising austerities. Then that king also, who was
afflicted by grief for the loss of his daughter, and was only prevented
by his ministers from committing suicide, entrusted to them the care of
his kingdom, and with the queen Kandarpasen&aacute; went to the city of
Alak&aacute; to visit king Mah&aacute;sena, who was his partner in
misfortune. And he made up his mind that he would do whatever that king
did, as soon as he had trustworthy intelligence with regard to the fate
of his son. And so he came to king Mah&aacute;sena, who was still more
grieved when he heard of the fate of Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and
sorrowed in sympathy with him. Then that king of Hansadv&iacute;pa
remained practising austerities with the king of Alak&aacute;,
restraining his senses, eating little, sleeping on
<i>darbha</i>-grass.</p>
<p>When they had been all scattered in this way in different directions
by the Disposer, as leaves by a wind, it happened that Sundarasena set
forth from the hermitage in which he was, and reached that hermitage of
Matanga, in which Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; was staying. There he
beheld a lake of clear water, the bank of which was thickly planted
with trees bent down with the weight of many ripe fruits of various
flavours. As he was weary, he bathed in that lake, and ate sweet
fruits, and then walked on with D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi, and reached a
forest stream. And going along its bank, he saw some hermit maidens
engaged in gathering flowers near a temple containing a Linga. And in
the midst of them he beheld one hermit maiden, who seemed to be the
peerless beauty of the world, illuminating the whole wood with her
loveliness, as if with moonlight, making all the regions full of blown
blue lilies with her glance, and sowing with her foot-falls a thicket
of lotuses in the forest.</p>
<p>Then the prince said to D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi, &ldquo;Who can
this be? Can she be a nymph of heaven worthy of being gazed upon by the
hundred-eyed Indra; or is she the presiding goddess of the forest with
her shoot-like fingers clinging to the flowers? Surely the Creator
framed this very wonderful form of hers after he had perfected his
skill by continual practice in creating many nymphs of heaven. And lo!
she exactly resembles in appearance my beloved
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, whose beauty I beheld in a picture. Why
should she not be the lady herself? But how can this be? She is in
Hansadv&iacute;pa far away from this heart of the forest. So I
cannot<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11236src" href="#xd27e11236" name=
"xd27e11236src">20</a> conceive who this fair one is, and whence she
comes, and how she comes to be here.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>And
D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi, when he saw that fair maid, said to the
prince, &ldquo;She must be whom you suppose her to be, otherwise how
could her ornaments, though made of forest flowers, thus resemble a
necklace, a zone, a string of bells, and the other ornaments usually
worn? Moreover, this beauty and delicacy are not produced in a forest;
so you may be certain that she is some heavenly nymph, or some
princess, not the daughter of a hermit. Let us rise up and stand
here<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11247src" href="#xd27e11247" name=
"xd27e11247src">21</a> a moment to find out.&rdquo; When <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e11256" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span> had said
this, they both of them stood there concealed by a tree.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile those hermit maidens, having gathered their
flowers, went down into that river with that lovely girl to bathe. And
while they were amusing themselves by splashing about in it, it
happened that an alligator came and seized that lovely girl. When those
maidens saw that, they were bewildered, and they cried out in their
sorrow, &ldquo;Help, help, ye woodland deities! For here is
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, while bathing in the river, suddenly and
unexpectedly seized by an alligator, and perishing.&rdquo; When
Sundarasena heard that, he thought to himself, &ldquo;Can this really
be that beloved of mine?&rdquo; and rushing forward he quickly killed
that alligator with his dagger. And when she fell from the
monster&rsquo;s mouth, as it were from the mouth of death, he carried
her up on the bank, and comforted her.</p>
<p>And she, for her part, having got over her fear, and seeing that he
was a charming person, said to herself, &ldquo;Who is this
great-hearted one that my good fortune has brought here to save my
life? Wonderful to say, he bears a close resemblance to that lover of
mine whom I saw in a picture, the high-born son of the king of
Alak&aacute;. Can he possibly be that very man? But out on my evil
thought! Heaven forefend! May such a man never be an exile from his
native land! So it is not fitting for me now to remain in the society
of a strange man. Accordingly, I will leave this place: may prosperity
be the lot of this great-souled one!&rdquo; After going through these
reflections, Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; said to those companions of
hers, &ldquo;First take a respectful leave of this noble gentleman, and
then come with me; we will now depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When prince Sundarasena, whose doubts were before unsatisfied, heard
this, he conceived great confidence from merely hearing his own name,
and he questioned one of her companions, saying to her,<a id=
"xd27e11265" name="xd27e11265"></a> &ldquo;Auspicious one, whose
daughter and of what condition is this friend of yours? Tell me, for I
feel a great desire to know.&rdquo; When he questioned the hermit
maiden in these words, she said to him, &ldquo;This is the princess
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, the daughter of king Mand&aacute;radeva, the
sovereign of Hansadv&iacute;pa. She was being conducted to the city of
Alak&aacute; to be married to prince Sundarasena, when her ship was
wrecked in the sea, and the waves flung her up upon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>the
shore: and the hermit Matanga found her there and brought her to his
hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, Sundarasena&rsquo;s friend <span class="corr"
id="xd27e11271" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>, dancing
like one bewildered with joy and despondency, said to the prince,
&ldquo;I congratulate you on having now been successful in obtaining
the princess Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;; for is not this that very lady
of whom we were thinking?&rdquo; When he had said this, her companions
the hermit maidens questioned him, and he told them his story; and they
gladdened with it that friend of theirs. Then Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;
exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, my husband,&rdquo; and fell weeping at the feet
of that Sundarasena. He, for his part, embraced her and wept, and while
they were weeping there, even stocks and herbs wept, melted with
compassion.</p>
<p>Then the hermit Matanga, having been informed of all this by those
hermit maidens, came there quickly, accompanied by Yamun&aacute;. He
comforted that Sundarasena, who prostrated himself at his feet, and
took him with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; to his own hermitage. And that
day he refreshed him by entertaining him, and made him feel happy; and
the next day the great hermit said to that prince, &ldquo;My son, I
must to-day go for a certain affair to &#346;vetadv&iacute;pa, so you
must go with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; to Alak&aacute;; there you must
marry this princess and cherish her; for I have adopted her as my
daughter, and I give her to you. And you shall rule the earth for a
long time with her; and you shall soon recover all those ministers of
yours.&rdquo; When the hermit had said this to the prince and his
betrothed, he took leave of them, and went away through the air with
his daughter Yamun&aacute;, who was equal to himself in power.</p>
<p>Then Sundarasena, with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and accompanied by
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11278" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>, set out
from that hermitage. And when he reached the shore of the sea, he saw
coming near him a light ship under the command of a young merchant. And
in order to accomplish his journey more easily, he asked the young
merchant who was the owner of that ship, through <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11281" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>, hailing
him from a distance, to give him a passage in it. The wicked merchant,
who beheld Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and was at once distracted with
love, consented, and brought his ship near the shore. Then Sundarasena
first placed his beloved on board the ship, and was preparing to get on
board himself from the bank where he stood, when the wicked merchant,
coveting his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, made a sign to the steersman, and
so set the ship in motion. And the ship, on board of which the princess
was crying piteously, rapidly disappeared from the view of Sundarasena,
who stood gazing at it.</p>
<p>And he fell on the ground crying out, &ldquo;Alas! I am robbed by
thieves,&rdquo; and wept for a long time, and then <span class="corr"
id="xd27e11286" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span> said to
him, &ldquo;Rise up! Abandon despondency! this is not a course
befitting a hero. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380"
name="pb380">380</a>]</span>Come along! Let us go in that direction to
look for that thief: for even in the most grievous hour of calamity the
wise do not take leave of their fortitude.&rdquo; When Sundarasena had
been thus exhorted by <span class="corr" id="xd27e11291" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>, he was at
last induced to rise up from the shore of the sea and set out.</p>
<p>And he went on his way weeping, and crying out, &ldquo;Alas, queen!
Alas, Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;!&rdquo; continually scorched by the
fire of separation, fasting, accompanied only by the weeping
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11296" title=
"Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>; and
almost beside himself with distraction he entered a great wood. And
when in it, he paid no attention to the wise counsels of his friend,
but ran hither and thither, thinking only of his beloved. When he saw
the creepers in full bloom, he said, &ldquo;Can this be my beloved come
here, adorned with blown flowers, having escaped from that
merchant-robber?&rdquo; When he saw the beautiful lotuses, he said,
&ldquo;Can she have dived into a tank in her fear, and is she lifting
up her face with long-lashed eyes and looking at me?&rdquo; And when he
heard the cuckoos singing concealed by the leafy creepers, he
said<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Is the
sweet-voiced fair one here addressing me?&rdquo; Thus raving at every
step, he wandered about for a long time, scorched by the moon, as if it
were the sun; and so to him the night was the same as the day.</p>
<p>And at last the prince with <span class="corr" id="xd27e11304"
title="Source: Dri&#7693;habuddhi">D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi</span>
emerged from that wood, though with difficulty, and having lost his
way, reached a great wilderness. It was perilous with fierce
rhinoceroses, dangerous as being inhabited by lions, and so was as
formidable<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11307src" href="#xd27e11307"
name="xd27e11307src">22</a> as an army, and moreover it was beset by a
host of bandits. When the prince entered this wilderness, which was
refugeless, and full of many misfortunes, like misery, he was set upon
with uplifted weapons, by some Pulindas, who happened to be on the look
out for human victims to offer to Durg&aacute;, by order of Vindhyaketu
the king of the Pulindas, who lived in that region. When the prince was
tormented with five fires, of misfortune, exile, the grief of
separation, that affront from a base man, fasting, and the fatigue of
the journey; alas! Fate created a sixth fire in the form of an attack
of bandits, as if in order to exhaust his self-command.</p>
<p>And when many of the bandits rushed towards him to seize him,
showering arrows, he, with only one companion to help him, killed them
with his dagger. When king Vindhyaketu discovered that, he sent forward
another force, and Sundarasena, being skilled in fighting, killed a
great many bandits belonging to that force also. At last he and his
companion fainted from the exhaustion of their wounds; and then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>those &#346;avaras bound them, and took them and
threw them into prison. The prison was full of multitudes of vermin,
filthy with cobwebs, and it was evident that snakes frequented it, as
they had dropped there the skins that clung to their throats. The dust
in it rose as high as the ancle,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11320src"
href="#xd27e11320" name="xd27e11320src">23</a> it was honey-combed with
the holes and galleries of mice, and full of many terrified and
miserable men that had been thrown into it. In that place, which seemed
the very birthplace of hells, they saw those two ministers
Bh&iacute;mabhuja and Vikrama&#347;akti, who, like themselves, had
entered that wilderness after escaping from the sea, in order to look
for their master, and had been already bound and thrown into prison.
They recognised the prince and fell weeping at his feet, and he
recognised them, and embraced them, bathed in tears.</p>
<p>Then their woes were increased a hundredfold by seeing one another;
but the other prisoners there said to them, in order to console them,
&ldquo;Enough of grief! Can we avoid the effect of acts done in a
previous state of existence? Do you not see that the death of all of us
together is imminent? For we have been collected here by this king of
the Pulindas, in order that he may offer us up to Durg&aacute; on the
coming fourteenth day of the month. So why should you grieve? The way
of Fate, that sports with living beings, is strange; as she has given
you misfortune, she may in the same way give you prosperity.&rdquo;
When the other prisoners had said this to them, they remained there
bound with them; it is terrible to see how little respect calamities
shew even for the great.</p>
<p>And when the fourteenth day arrived, they were all taken thence by
the orders of the king to the temple of Durg&aacute; to be sacrificed.
It seemed like the mouth of death, the flame of the lamp being its
lolling tongue, the range of bells being its row of teeth, to which the
heads of men clung.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11334src" href=
"#xd27e11334" name="xd27e11334src">24</a> Then Sundarasena, when he saw
that goddess, bowed before her, and praised her with mind humbled by
devotion, and uttered this prayer, &ldquo;O thou goddess that didst
quell the oppression of the Asuras with thy blood-streaming trident,
which mangled haughty Daityas, thou that givest security to thy
votaries, look upon me, goddess, that am burned up with the forest-fire
of grief, with a favourable nectar-shedding eye, and refresh me. Honour
to thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the prince was saying this, Vindhyaketu, that king of the
Pulindas, came there to worship the goddess Durg&aacute;. The moment
the prince saw the king of the Bhillas, he recognised him, and being
bowed down with shame, said of his own accord to his friends,
&ldquo;Ha! this is that very Vindhyaketu, the chief of the Pulindas,
who comes to my father&rsquo;s court to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb382" href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>pay him homage, and
is the lord of this vast wilderness. Whatever may happen, we must not
say anything here, for it is better for a man of honour to die, than to
make known who he is under such circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the prince was saying this to his ministers, king Vindhyaketu
said to his servants, &ldquo;Come now, shew me this heroic human
victim, who killed so many of my warriors when he was being
captured.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> As
soon as his servants heard this, they brought Sundarasena, smeared with
clotted blood, and defiled with wounds, into the presence of that king.
When the king of the Bhillas saw him, he half recognised him, and being
terrified, said to him, &ldquo;Tell me, who are you, and whence do you
come?&rdquo; Sundarasena answered the king of the Bhillas, &ldquo;What
does it matter who I am, or whence I come? Do what you are about to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Vindhyaketu recognised him completely by his voice, and
exclaiming excitedly, &ldquo;Alas! Alas!&rdquo; fell on the ground.
Then he embraced the prince, and said, &ldquo;Alas, great king
Mah&aacute;sena, see what a fitting return I, villain that I am, have
now made for your numerous benefits, in that I have here reduced to
such a state your son, whom you value as your life, prince Sundarasena,
who has come here from somewhere or other!&rdquo; This and many other
such laments he uttered in such a way that all there began to shed
tears. But the delighted companions of Sundarasena comforted the Bhilla
king, saying to him, &ldquo;Is not this much that you recognised the
prince before any misfortune had happened? What could you have done
after the event had taken place? So why do you despond in the midst of
this joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king fell at the feet of Sundarasena, and lovingly honoured
him, and Sundarasena got him to set all the human victims free. And
after he had shown him all due respect, he took him to his village and
his friends with him, and proceeded to bandage his wounds and
administer medicines to him; and he said to him, &ldquo;Tell me,
prince, what brought you to this place, for I have a great desire to
know.&rdquo; Then Sundarasena related to him all his adventures. And
that prince of the &#346;avaras, being astonished, said to him,
&ldquo;What a wonderful chain of events! That you should have set out
to marry Mandaravat&iacute;, and that you should then have been
wrecked<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11353src" href="#xd27e11353" name=
"xd27e11353src">25</a> in the sea, and that this should have led to
your reaching the hermitage of Matanga, and to your meeting your
beloved there, and that this merchant, in whom you confided, should
have carried her off from you, and that you should have entered the
wilderness, and have been imprisoned for sacrifice, and recognised by
me and delivered from that death&mdash;how strangely does all this hang
together! Therefore honour by all means to mysteriously working
Destiny! And you must not feel anxious about your beloved, for, as
Destiny has done all this, she will also do you that other service
soon.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>While the king of the Pulindas was saying this, his
commander-in-chief came quickly in a state of high delight, and
entering said to him, &ldquo;King, a certain merchant entered this
wilderness with his followers, and he had with him much wealth and a
very beautiful lady, a very gem of women; and when I heard of this, I
went with an army, and seized him and his followers, with the wealth
and the lady, and I have them here outside.&rdquo; When Sundarasena and
Vindhyaketu heard this, they said to themselves &ldquo;Can these be
that merchant and Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;?&rdquo; And they said,
&ldquo;Let the merchant and the lady be brought in here at once,&rdquo;
and thereupon the commander-in-chief brought in that merchant and that
lady. When D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi saw them, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Here
is that very princess Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and here is that
villain of a merchant. Alas, princess! How came you to be reduced to
this state, like a creeper scorched by the heat, with your bud-like lip
dried up, and with your flower-ornaments stripped off?&rdquo; While
D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi was uttering this exclamation, Sundarasena
rushed forward, and eagerly threw his arms round the neck of his
beloved. Then the two lovers wept for a long time, as if to wash off
from one another, by the water of a shower of tears, the defilement of
separation.</p>
<p>Then Vindhyaketu, having consoled them both, said to that merchant,
&ldquo;How came you to carry off the wife of one who confided in
you?&rdquo; Then the merchant said, with a voice trembling with fear,
&ldquo;I have fruitlessly done this to my own destruction, but this
holy saint was preserved by her own unapproachable splendour; I was no
more able to touch her, than if she had been a flame of fire; and I did
intend, villain that I was, to take her to my own country, and after
her anger had been allayed, and she had been reconciled to me, to marry
her.&rdquo; When the merchant had said this, the king ordered him to be
put to death on the spot; but Sundarasena saved him from execution;
however he had his abundant wealth confiscated, a heavier loss than
that of life; for those that have lost their wealth die daily, not so
those that have lost their breath.</p>
<p>So Sundarasena had that merchant set at liberty, and the wretched
creature went where he would, pleased at having escaped with life; and
king Vindhyaketu took Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and went with her and
Sundarasena to the palace of his own queen. There he gave orders to his
queen, and had Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; honoured with a bath, with
clothes and with unguents, and after Sundarasena had been in the same
way bathed and adorned, he made him sit down on a splendid throne, and
honoured him with gifts, pearls, musk, and so on. And on account of the
reunion of that couple, the king made a great feast, at which all the
&#346;avara women danced delighted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, the next day, Sundarasena said to the king, &ldquo;My wounds
are healed, and my object is attained, so I will now go hence to my own
city; and, please, send off at once to my father a messenger with a
letter, to tell the whole story, and announce my
arrival.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11372src" href="#xd27e11372"
name="xd27e11372src">26</a> When the &#346;avara chief heard this, he
sent off a messenger with a letter, and gave him the message which the
prince suggested.</p>
<p>And just as the letter-carrier was reaching the city of
Alak&aacute;, it happened that king Mah&aacute;sena and his queen,
afflicted because they heard no tidings of Sundarasena, were preparing
to enter the fire in front of a temple of &#346;iva, surrounded by all
the citizens, who were lamenting their approaching loss. Then the
&#346;avara, who was bearing the letter, beholding king
Mah&aacute;sena, came running up proclaiming who he was, stained with
dust, bow in hand, with his hair tied up in a knot behind with a
creeper, black himself, and wearing a loin-cincture of
<i>vilva</i>-leaves. That letter-carrier of the king of the Bhillas
said, &ldquo;King, you are blessed with good fortune to-day, as your
son Sundarasena has come with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, having escaped
from the sea; for he has arrived at the court of my master Vindhyaketu,
and is on his way to this place with him, and has sent me on
before.&rdquo; Having said this, and thus discharged his confidential
commission, the letter-carrier of the Bhilla king laid the letter at
the monarch&rsquo;s feet. Then all the people there, being delighted,
raised a shout of joy; and the letter was read out, and the whole of
the wonderful circumstances became known; and king Mah&aacute;sena
recompensed the letter-carrier, and abandoned his grief, and made great
rejoicings, and entered his palace with all his retainers. And the next
day, being impatient, he set out to meet his son, whose arrival he
expected, accompanied by the king of Hansadv&iacute;pa. And his force
of four arms marched along with him, innumerable, so that the earth
trembled, dreading insupportable weight.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Sundarasena set out from that village of the
Bhillas for his own home, with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;. And he was
accompanied by his friends Vikrama&#347;akti and Bh&iacute;mabhuja,
whom he found in the prison, and D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi too was with
him. He himself rode on a horse swift as the wind, by the side of
Vindhyaketu, and seemed by the hosts of Pulindas that followed him, to
be exhibiting the earth as belonging to that race. And as he was
marching along, in a few days he beheld on the road his father coming
to meet him, with his retinue and his connections. Then he got down
from his horse, and the people beheld him with joy, and he and his
friends went up and fell at the feet of his father. His father, when he
beheld his son looking like the full moon, felt like the sea which
surges up with throbbings of joy, and overflows its bounds, and could
not contain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>himself for happiness.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11390src" href="#xd27e11390" name="xd27e11390src">27</a> And when
he saw Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, his daughter-in-law, bowing at his
feet, he considered himself and his family prosperous, and rejoiced.
And the king welcomed D&#7771;i&#7693;habuddhi and the other two
ministers of his son, who bowed at his feet, and he received
Vindhyaketu with still warmer welcome.</p>
<p>Then Sundarasena bowed before his father-in-law Mand&aacute;radeva,
whom his father introduced to him, and rejoiced exceedingly; and
beholding his ministers Cha&#7751;&#7693;aprabha and
Vy&aacute;ghrapar&aacute;krama, who had arrived before, clinging to his
feet, he considered that all his wishes were accomplished. And
immediately king Mahendr&aacute;ditya, who was delighted at hearing
what had happened, came there from &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura out of
affection. Then prince Sundarasena, mounted on a splendid horse,
escorting his beloved, as Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara did Rambh&aacute;,
went with all those to his own home, the city of Alak&aacute;, the
dwelling-place of all felicities, abounding in virtuous men. And
accompanied by his beloved he entered the palace of his father, being
sprinkled, as he passed through the city, by the wives of the citizens,
who were all crowding to the windows, with the blue lotuses of their
eyes. And in the palace he bowed at the feet of his mother, whose eyes
were full of tears of joy, and then spent that day in rejoicings, in
which all his relations and servants took part.</p>
<p>And the next day, in the long desired hour fixed by the astrologers,
the prince received the hand of Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, who was
bestowed on him by her father. And his father-in-law, king
Mand&aacute;radeva, as he had no son, bestowed on him many priceless
jewels, in his joy, and the reversion of his kingdom after his own
death. And his father, king Mah&aacute;sena, without exhausting the
earth, made a great feast, in a style suitable to his desires and
means, in which all prisoners were released, and a rain of gold was
seen.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11397src" href="#xd27e11397" name=
"xd27e11397src">28</a> And having beheld Sundarasena prosperous by his
union with Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and having taken part in his
wedding festivities, in which all the women danced to song, and having
been honoured by king Mah&aacute;sena, king Mand&aacute;radeva returned
to his own territory, and the king of &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkapura
returned to that city, and Vindhyaketu, the lord of the great
wilderness, returned to his domain.</p>
<p>And after some days had elapsed, king Mah&aacute;sena, perceiving
that his son Sundarasena was virtuous and beloved by the subjects,
established him in his throne, and went himself to the forest. And
prince Sundarasena, having thus obtained the kingdom, and having
conquered all his enemies by the might of his arm, ruled with those
ministers the whole earth, and found his joy in the possession of
Mand&aacute;ravat&iacute; ever increasing. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the minister Vy&aacute;ghrasena had told this story on the bank
of the lake to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, he went on to say to him,
&ldquo;This wonderful tale, prince, did the hermit Kanva relate to us
in the hermitage, and at the end of the tale the compassionate man said
to us, to comfort us, &lsquo;So, my sons, those who endure with
resolute hearts terrible misfortunes hard to struggle through, attain
in this way the objects they most desire; but those others, whose
energies are paralysed by loss of courage, fail. Therefore abandon this
despondency, and go on your way. Your master also, prince <span class=

"Source: Mrig&aacute;nkadatta">M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta</span>, shall
recover all his ministers, and shall long rule the earth, after having
been united with &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;.&rsquo; When that
great hermit had said this to us, we plucked up courage, and spent the
night there, and then set out from that hermitage, and in course of
time reached this wood, travel-worn. And while here, being tortured
with excessive thirst and hunger, we climbed up this tree sacred to
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11411" title=
"Source: Gane&#347;a">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</span>, to get fruits, and we
were ourselves turned into fruits, and we have now, prince, been
released from our fruit-transformation by your austerities. Such have
been the adventures of us four, during our separation from you<a class=

<p>When <span class="corr" id="xd27e11422" title=

<p class="first">Then, the next morning, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta
rose up from the shore of that beautiful lake, together with all his
ministers, who had rejoined him; and in company with them, and the
Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi, set out for Ujjayin&iacute;, to win
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, after he had paid his orisons to
that tree of <span class="corr" id="xd27e11435" title=
"Source: Gane&#347;a">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</span>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11438src" href="#xd27e11438" name="xd27e11438src">1</a></p>
<p>Then the heroic prince, accompanied by his ministers, again crossed
various stretches of woodland, which contained many hundreds of lakes,
and were black with <i>tam&aacute;la</i>-trees<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11446src" href="#xd27e11446" name="xd27e11446src">2</a>
throughout their whole expanse, looking like nights in the rainy
season, when the clouds collect; and others which had their canes
broken by terrible infuriated elephants roaming through them, in which
the <i>arjuna</i>-trees formed a strong contrast to the
<i>tam&aacute;la</i>-trees,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11458src" href=
"#xd27e11458" name="xd27e11458src">3</a> and which thus resembled so
many cities of king Vir&aacute;&#7789;a; and ravines of mighty
mountains, which were pure, though strewn with flowers, and though
frequented by subdued hermits, were haunted by fierce beasts; and at
last came near the city of Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>Then he reached the river Gandhavat&iacute;, and dispelled his
fatigue by bathing in it, and after crossing it, he arrived with his
companions in that cemetery of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la. There he beheld
the image of mighty Bhairava, black with the smoke from neighbouring
pyres, surrounded with many fragments of bones and skulls, terrible
with the skeletons of men which it held in its grasp, worshipped by
heroes, frequented by many troops of demons, dear to sporting
witches.</p>
<p>And after crossing the cemetery, he beheld the city of
Ujjayin&iacute;, a <i>yuga</i> old, ruled by king Karmasena. Its
streets were watched by guards with various weapons, who were
themselves begirt by many brave high-born R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts; it was
surrounded with ramparts resembling the peaks of mighty mountains; it
was crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, and hard for
strangers to enter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388"
name="pb388">388</a>]</span></p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta beheld that city, which was thus
inaccessible on every side, he turned his face away in despondency, and
said to his ministers, &ldquo;Alas! ill-starred man that I am! though
it has cost me hundreds of hardships to reach this city, I cannot even
enter it; what chance then have I of obtaining my beloved?&rdquo; When
they heard this, they said to him, &ldquo;What! do you suppose, prince,
that this great city could ever be stormed by us, who are so few in
number? We must think of some expedient to serve in this emergency, and
an expedient will certainly be found; how comes it that you have
forgotten that this expedition has frequently been enjoined by the
gods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had been thus addressed by his
ministers, he remained for some days roaming about outside the
city.</p>
<p>Then his minister Vikramake&#347;arin called to mind that
Vet&aacute;la, which he had long ago won over, intending to employ him
to fetch the prince&rsquo;s love from her dwelling-house. And the
Vet&aacute;la came, black in hue, tall, with a neck like a camel,
elephant-faced, with legs like a bull, eyes like an owl, and the ears
of an ass. But finding that he could not enter the city, he departed;
the favour of &#346;iva secures that city against being invaded by such
creatures.</p>
<p>Then the Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi, who was versed in policy,
said to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, as he was sitting in gloom,
surrounded by his ministers, longing in his heart to enter the city;
&ldquo;Why, prince, though you know the true principles of policy, do
you remain bewildered, like one ignorant of them? Who will ever be
victorious in this world by disregarding the difference between himself
and his foe? For at every one of the four gates of this city, two
thousand elephants, twenty-five thousand horses, ten thousand chariots,
and a hundred thousand footmen remain harnessed and ready, day and
night, to guard it; and they are hard to conquer, being commanded by
heroes. So, as for a handful of men, like ourselves, entering it by
force, that is a mere chimerical fancy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11480src" href="#xd27e11480" name="xd27e11480src">4</a> not a
measure calculated to ensure success. Moreover, this city cannot be
overthrown by a small force; and a contest with an overwhelming force
is like fighting on foot against an elephant. So join with your friend
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u the king of the Pulindas, whom you
delivered from the terrible danger of the water-monsters in the
Narmad&aacute;, and with his friend Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha the very
powerful king of the M&aacute;tangas, who is attached to you on account
of his alliance with him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11495src" href=
"#xd27e11495" name="xd27e11495src">5</a> and with that king of the
Kir&aacute;tas, named &#346;aktirakshita, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>who is famous for his
valour and has observed a vow of strict chastity from his youth
upwards, and let them all bring their forces, and then do you, thus
strengthened by allies, fill every quarter with your hosts, and so
accomplish the object you have in view. Moreover, the king of the
Kir&aacute;tas is awaiting your coming from a distance in accordance
with your agreement; how have you come to forget this? And no doubt,
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u is ready awaiting your arrival, in the
territory of<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11503src" href="#xd27e11503"
name="xd27e11503src">6</a> the king of the M&aacute;tangas, for you
made this agreement with him. So let us go to the castle named
Karabhagr&iacute;va, on the southern slope of the Vindhyas, in which
that chief of the M&aacute;tangas dwells. And let us summon there
&#346;aktirakshita, the king of the Kir&aacute;tas, and united with
them all make a fortunate expedition with every chance of success.</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and his ministers heard this speech
of &#346;rutadhi&rsquo;s, which was full of sense and such as the wise
would approve, they eagerly accepted it, saying, &ldquo;So be
it.&rdquo; And the next day the prince adored that unresting traveller
of the sky, the sun, the friend of the virtuous, that had just arisen,
revealing every quarter of the world,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11527src" href="#xd27e11527" name="xd27e11527src">7</a> and set
out for the abode of Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha king of the
M&aacute;tangas on the southern slope of the Vindhya range. And his
ministers Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama, and Vy&aacute;ghrasena, and
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and Meghabala with Vimalabuddhi, and
Sth&uacute;lab&aacute;hu with Vichitrakatha, and Vikramake&#347;arin,
and Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti, and &#346;rutadhi and
D&#7771;i&#7693;hamush&#7789;i followed him. With them he successively
crossed forests wide-ranging as his own undertakings, and stretches of
woodland profound as his own schemes, with no better refuge at night
than the root of a tree<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11530src" href=
"#xd27e11530" name="xd27e11530src">8</a> on the shore of a lake, and
reached and ascended the Vindhya mountain lofty as his own soul.</p>
<p>Then the prince went from the summit of the mountain down its
southern slope, and beholding afar off the villages of the Bhillas full
of elephants&rsquo; tusks and deer-skins, he said to himself,
&ldquo;How am I to know where the dwelling of that king of the
M&aacute;tangas is?&rdquo; While engaged in such reflections, he and
his ministers saw a hermit boy come towards them, and after doing
obeisance to him, they said, &ldquo;Fair Sir, do you know in what part
of this region the palace of Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha, the king of the
M&aacute;tangas, is? For we wish to see him.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>When that good young ascetic heard this, he said, &ldquo;Only a
<i>kos</i> distant from this place is a spot called Panchavat&iacute;,
and not far from it was the hermitage of the hermit Agastya, who with
small effort cast down from heaven the haughty king Nahusha; where
R&aacute;ma, who by command of his father took up his dwelling in a
forest, accompanied by Lakshma&#7751;a and his wife S&iacute;t&aacute;,
long waited on that hermit; where Kabandha,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11545src" href="#xd27e11545" name="xd27e11545src">9</a> who
guided R&aacute;ma to the slaughter of the R&aacute;kshasas, proceeded
to attack R&aacute;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a, as R&aacute;hu does the sun
and moon, whose arm a <i>yojana</i> in length R&aacute;ma felled, so
that it resembled Nahusha in his serpent form, come to supplicate
Agastya; where even now the R&aacute;kshasas hearing the roaring of the
clouds at the beginning of the rainy season, call to mind the twanging
of the bow of R&aacute;ma; where the aged deer, that were fed by
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11551" title=
"Source: &#346;it&aacute;">S&iacute;t&aacute;</span>, beholding the
regions deserted in every direction, with eyes filling with tears,
reject the mouthful of grass; where M&aacute;r&iacute;cha, who brought
about S&iacute;t&aacute;&rsquo;s separation from her husband, assumed
the form of a golden deer and enticed away R&aacute;ma, as if to save
from slaughter those deer, that were still left alive; where, in many a
great lake full of the water of the K&aacute;ver&iacute;, it appears as
if Agastya had vomited up in driblets the sea that he swallowed. Not
far from that hermitage, on a table-land of the Vindhya, is a
stronghold tangled and inaccessible, named Karabhagr&iacute;va. In it
dwells that mighty Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha of terrible valour, chief
of the M&aacute;tangas, whom kings cannot conquer. And he commands a
hundred thousand bowmen of that tribe, every one of whom is followed by
five hundred warriors. With the aid of those brigands he robs caravans,
destroys his enemies, and enjoys this great forest, caring nought for
this or that king.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11554src" href=
"#xd27e11554" name="xd27e11554src">10</a></p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had heard this from the young
hermit, he took leave of him, and went quickly, with his companions, in
the direction indicated by him, and in course of time he arrived in the
environs of Karabhagr&iacute;va that stronghold of the king of the
M&aacute;tangas, which were crowded with Bhilla villages. And within
them he beheld near at hand on every side crowds of &#346;avaras,
adorned with peacocks&rsquo; feathers and elephants&rsquo; teeth,
clothed in tigers&rsquo; skins, and living on the flesh of deer. When
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta saw those Bhillas, he said to his ministers,
&ldquo;See! these men live a wild forest life like animals, and yet,
strange to say, they recognise Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha as their king.
There is no race in the world without a king; I do believe the gods
introduced this magical name among men in their alarm, fearing that
otherwise the strong would devour the weak, as great fishes eat the
little.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11559src" href="#xd27e11559"
name="xd27e11559src">11</a> And while he was saying this, and trying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>to find the path that led to the stronghold
Karabhagr&iacute;va, the scouts of M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, the
king of the &#346;avaras, who had already arrived there, recognized
him, having seen him before. They immediately went and told that
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u of his arrival; and he with his army went
to meet him. And when that king of the Pulindas came near, and saw the
prince, he alighted from his horse, and ran forward, and fell at his
feet. And he embraced the prince, who asked after his health, and then
mounted him and his ministers on horses, and brought them to his own
camp. And that king of the &#346;avaras sent his own warder to inform
the king of the M&aacute;tangas of the prince&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>And Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha, the king of the M&aacute;tangas,
quickly came there from his own place, and his appearance justified his
name.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11569src" href="#xd27e11569" name=
"xd27e11569src">12</a> He seemed like a second Vindhya range, for his
body was firm as a rocky peak, his hue was black as
<i>tam&aacute;la</i>, and Pulindas lay at his foot. His face was
rendered terrible by a natural three-furrowed frown, and so he appeared
as if Durg&aacute;, the dweller in the Vindhya range, had marked him
with the trident, to claim him as her own. Though young, he had seen
the death of many &ldquo;secular birds;&rdquo; though black, he was not
comely; and he crouched to none, though he hugged the foot of a
mountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11575src" href="#xd27e11575" name=
"xd27e11575src">13</a> Like a fresh cloud, he displayed the peacock
tail and the gay-coloured bow; like Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11587src" href="#xd27e11587" name=
"xd27e11587src">14</a> his body was scarred by the furious boar; like
Gha&#7789;otkacha, he was mighty and possessed a haughty and terrible
shape;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11590src" href="#xd27e11590" name=
"xd27e11590src">15</a> like the Kali age, he allowed those born under
his sway to take pleasure in wickedness and break through the bonds of
rule. And the mass of his host came filling the earth, like the stream
of the Narmad&aacute;, when let loose from the embrace of
Arjuna.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11599src" href="#xd27e11599" name=
"xd27e11599src">16</a> And so the aggregated army of the
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las moved on, blackening all the horizon with
a dark hue, making those who beheld it say in perplexity to themselves
&ldquo;Can this be a mass of rock that has rolled down from the Anjana
mountain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11604src" href="#xd27e11604" name=
"xd27e11604src">17</a> or is it a premature bank of the clouds of the
day of doom, that has descended upon the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And their chief Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha came up to
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, placing his head upon the ground even when
at a distance, and bowed before him, and said &ldquo;To-day the goddess
Durg&aacute; is pleased with me, in that your Highness, of such a noble
race, has come to my house. On that account <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>I
consider myself fortunate and successful. When the king of the
M&aacute;tangas had said this, he gave him a present of pearls, musk,
and other rarities. And the prince kindly accepted it with the usual
courtesies. Then they all encamped there. That great forest was covered
all over with elephants fastened to posts, with horses in stables, and
tented footmen; and was scarcely able to contain itself, being confused
with its good fortune in thus being assimilated to a city, which was
unprecedented in the course of its existence.</p>
<p>Then, in that wood, when M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had bathed in
the river for good fortune, and had taken food, and was sitting at his
ease, in a secluded spot, surrounded by his ministers,
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u also being present,
Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha said to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, in the
course of conversation, speaking in a tone softened by affection and
regard, &ldquo;This king M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u came here a long
time ago, and has been remaining here with me, my lord, awaiting your
orders. So where, my prince, have you all remained so long? And what
have you done? Tell me, now, the business that detained you.&rdquo;
When the prince heard this speech of his, he said, &ldquo;After I had
left the palace of our friend here M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, with
Vimalabuddhi and Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara, and &#346;rutadhi, and
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11615" title=
"Source: Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;kram&#803;a">Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama</span>,
whom I had also recovered, I found on my way this <span class="corr"
id="xd27e11618" title=
"Source: Pracha&#7751;&#7693;as&aacute;kti">Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#347;akti</span>
and Vichitrakatha, and in course of time also this Vikramake&#347;arin.
Then these men here found on the borders of a beautiful lake a tree
sacred to Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and climbed up it to pick its fruit, and
so were turned into fruits themselves by the curse of the god. Then I
propitiated Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and not without difficulty set them
free, and at the same time I delivered these other four ministers of
mine, D&#7771;i&#7693;hamush&#7789;i and Vy&aacute;ghrasena and
Meghabala and Sth&uacute;lab&aacute;hu, who had previously suffered the
same transformation. With all these, thus recovered, I went to
Ujjayin&iacute;; but the gates were guarded, and we could not even
enter the town; much less could we think of any device for carrying off
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;. And as I had no army with me, I
had no <i>locus standi</i> for sending an ambassador. So we deliberated
together, and came here to you. Now, my friend, you and your allies
have to decide whether we shall attain our end or no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had related his adventures in these
words, Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha and M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u said,
&ldquo;Be of good courage; this is but a little matter for us to
accomplish at once; our lives were originally created for your sake. We
will bring here that king Karmasena in chains, and we will carry off
his daughter &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king of the M&aacute;tangas and
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u said this, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta said
lovingly and very respectfully, &ldquo;What will you not be able to
accomplish, for this resolute courage of yours is a sufficient
guarantee that you will carry out that furtherance of your
friend&rsquo;s interests which you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393"
href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>have undertaken. When the
Creator made you here, he infused into your composition qualities
borrowed from your surroundings, the firmness of the Vindhya hills, the
courage of the tigers, and the warm attachment to friends of the
forest<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11630src" href="#xd27e11630" name=
"xd27e11630src">18</a> lotuses. So deliberate and do what is
fitting.&rdquo; While M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was saying this, the
sun retired to rest on the summit of the mountain of setting. Then they
also rested that night in the royal camp, as was meet, sleeping in
booths made by the workmen.</p>
<p>And the next morning M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta sent off
Gu&#7751;&aacute;kara to bring his friend &#346;aktirakshita, the king
of the Kir&aacute;tas. He went and communicated the state of affairs to
that sovereign; and in a very few days the king of the Kir&aacute;tas
returned with him, bringing a very large force. Ten hundred thousand
footmen, and two hundred thousand horse, and a myriad of furious
elephants on which heroes were mounted, and eighty-eight thousand
chariots followed that king, who darkened the heaven with his banners
and his umbrella. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, with his friends and
ministers, went to meet him in high spirits and honoured him and
conducted him into the camp. And in the meanwhile other friends and
relations of the king of the M&aacute;tangas, and all those of king
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, having been summoned by messengers, came
in.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11637src" href="#xd27e11637" name=
"xd27e11637src">19</a> And the camp swelled like the ocean, giving joy
to the heart of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta: with shouts rising up like
the roar of the waves, and hundreds of battalions pouring in like
rivers. And Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha honoured<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11646src" href="#xd27e11646" name="xd27e11646src">20</a> those
assembled kings with musk, and garments, and pieces of flesh, and
spirits distilled from fruits. And M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u the
king of the &#346;avaras gave them all splendid baths, unguents, food,
drink, and beds. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta sat down to eat with
all those kings who were seated in their proper places.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11652src" href="#xd27e11652" name=
"xd27e11652src">21</a> He even went so far as to make the king of the
M&aacute;tangas eat in his presence though at a little distance from
him: the fact is, it is necessity and place and time that take
precedence, not one man of another.</p>
<p>And the next day, when the newly arrived force of Kir&aacute;tas and
others had rested, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, sitting on a throne of
ivory in the assembly of the kings, where he had been duly honoured,
after he had had the place cleared of attendants, said to his friends,
the king of the M&aacute;tangas, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>the others,
&ldquo;Why do we now delay? Why do we not quickly march towards
Ujjayin&iacute; with the whole of this force?&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi heard this, he said to that prince,
&ldquo;Listen prince, I now speak according to the opinion of those who
know policy. A king who wishes to be victorious must first see the
distinction between what is practicable and what is not practicable.
What cannot be accomplished by an expedient, he should reject as
impracticable. That is practicable which can be accomplished by an
expedient. Now expedients in this matter are of four kinds, and are
enumerated as conciliation, gifts, division and force. This order
represents their comparative advantages, the first being better than
the second, and so on. So, my prince, you ought first to make use of
conciliation in this business. For, as king Karmasena is not greedy of
gain, gifts are not likely to succeed; nor is division likely to be of
any use, for none of his servants are angry, or covetous, or indignant
with him, on account of having been treated with neglect. As for force,
its employment is risky; as that king lives in a difficult country, has
a very formidable army, and has never been conquered by any king
before. Moreover even mighty ones cannot always be assured of having
the fortune of victory on their side in battles; besides, it is not
becoming in one, who is a suitor for a maiden&rsquo;s hand, to
slaughter her relations. So let us send an ambassador to that monarch,
adopting the method of conciliation. If that does not succeed, the
method of force shall be employed as being unavoidable.&rdquo; All
there, when they heard this speech of &#346;rutadhi&rsquo;s, approved
it, and praised his statesmanship.</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta deliberated with them all, and sent
a servant of the king of the Kir&aacute;tas, a noble Br&aacute;hman,
Suvigraha by name, who possessed all the requisites of a diplomatist,
to king Karmasena, as an ambassador to communicate the result of their
deliberations, and he carried with him a letter, and was also entrusted
with a verbal message. The ambassador went to Ujjayin&iacute;, and,
being introduced by the warder, entered the king&rsquo;s palace, the
interior of which looked very magnificent, as its zones were crowded
with splendid horses, and with elephants; and he saw that king
Karmasena, sitting on his throne, surrounded by his ministers. He did
obeisance to that sovereign, who welcomed him; and after he had sat
down, and his health had been enquired after, he proceeded to deliver
to him his letter. And the king&rsquo;s minister, named
Prajn&aacute;ko&#347;a, took it, and broke the seal, and unfolding the
letter, proceeded to read it out to the following effect.
&ldquo;All-Hail! The auspicious M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, ornament of
the circle of the earth, son of the great king of kings who is lord of
the city of Ayodhy&aacute;, the fortunate Amaradatta, from the slope of
the forest at the foot of the castle of Karabhagr&iacute;va, where he
now is, with kings submissive and obedient to him, sends this plain
message to the great king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href=
"#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>Karmasena in Ujjayin&iacute;, who
is the moon of the sea of his own race, with all due respect; You have
a daughter, and you must without fail give her to another, so give her
to me; for she has been declared by the gods a suitable wife for me. In
this way we shall become allies, and our former enmity will be at an
end; if you do not consent, I will appeal to my own strong arms to give
me this object of my desires.&rdquo; When the letter had been thus read
by the minister Prajn&aacute;ko&#347;a, king Karmasena, inflamed with
rage, said to his ministers, &ldquo;These people are always hostile to
us; and observe, this man, not knowing his place, has on the present
occasion worded his communication in an objectionable form. He has put
himself first and me last, out of contempt; and at the end the
conceited fellow has bragged of the might of his arm. So, I do not
consider that I ought to send any reply; as for giving him my daughter,
that is out of the question. Depart, ambassador; let your master do
what he can.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11669src" href=
"#xd27e11669" name="xd27e11669src">22</a></p>
<p>When king Karmasena said this, that Br&aacute;hman ambassador
Suvigraha, being a man of spirit, gave him an answer well-suited to the
occasion, &ldquo;Fool, you boast now, because you have not seen that
prince; make ready; when be arrives, you will learn the difference
between yourself and your opponent.&rdquo; When the ambassador said
this, the whole court was in a state of excitement; but the king,
though in wrath, said, &ldquo;Away with you! Your person is inviolable,
so what can we do?&rdquo; Then some of those present, biting their
lips, and wringing their hands together, said one to another,
&ldquo;Why do we not follow him and kill him this moment.&rdquo; But
others, being masters of themselves, said, &ldquo;Let the young fool of
a Br&aacute;hman go! why do you trouble yourselves about the speech of
this babbler? We will shew what we can do.&rdquo; Others again,
appearing to foreshadow by their frowns the speedy bending of their
bows, remained silent, with faces red with rage.</p>
<p>The whole court being thus incensed, the ambassador Suvigraha went
out, and repaired to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta in his camp. He told
him and his friends what Karmasena had said; and the prince, when he
heard it, ordered the army to march. Then the sea of soldiers, set in
motion by the order of the commander, as by a violent gust of wind, in
which men, horses, and elephants moved like bounding sea-monsters,
exciting satisfaction in the mind of the allied monarchs,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11677src" href="#xd27e11677" name=
"xd27e11677src">23</a> assumed an agitation terrifying to the minds of
timid men. Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, making the earth miry with
the foam of high-mettled horses, and the frontal ichor of elephants,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=

drums, moved on slowly to Ujjayin&iacute; to victory.</p>

<p class="first">Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, accompanied by his
friends, crossed the Vindhya range, and with his army ready for battle,
reached the frontier of Ujjayin&iacute;. When the brave king Karmasena
heard that, he also made ready for the fight, and with his army moved
out from the city to meet him. And when those two armies came to close
quarters, and could see one another, a battle took place between them,
that gladdened heroes. The battlefield seemed like the dwelling-place
of Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, as it was full of timid demons dispersed
in terror by the roar of the Man-lion;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11690src" href="#xd27e11690" name="xd27e11690src">1</a> the
continued dense showers of arrows flying through the air, and cutting
one another, descended on brave warriors, like locusts on the tender
herb. Dense clouds of pearls gleamed as they sprang from the frontal
globes of elephants struck with swords, resembling the necklace of the
Fortune of that battle broken in her agitation. That place of combat
appeared like the mouth of Death; and the sharp points of spears, that
seized on men, horses, and elephants, were like his fangs. The heads of
strong-armed warriors, cut off with crescent-headed arrows, flew up to
heaven, as if leaping up<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11699src" href=
"#xd27e11699" name="xd27e11699src">2</a> to kiss the heavenly nymphs;
and at every moment trunks of brave heroes danced, as if in delight at
the battle of their noble leader being gloriously illuminated; and so
for five days that hero-destroying battle went on, with flowing rivers
of blood, rich in mountains of heads.</p>
<p>And in the evening of the fifth day the Br&aacute;hman &#346;rutadhi
came secretly to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta when he was closeted with
his ministers, and said to him, &ldquo;While you were engaged in
fighting, I went away from the camp, in the disguise of a mendicant,
and entered Ujjayin&iacute;, the gates of which were almost deserted;
and now listen; I will tell you truly what I observed, being myself all
the while, though near at hand, unseen in virtue of my knowledge. As
soon as king Karmasena went out to battle, <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11716" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>
with the permission of her mother also left the palace, and repaired to
a temple of Gaur&iacute; in that city, to propitiate the goddess,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>in order to ensure her father&rsquo;s success in
the combat. And while she was there, she said in secret to a devoted
confidante &lsquo;My friend, it is for my sake, that my father has
become involved in this war. And if he is conquered, he will give me to
that prince; for kings disregard love for offspring altogether, when
the interests of their kingdoms are at stake. And I do not know whether
that prince is a suitable match for me in respect of personal
appearance, or not. I would sooner meet my death than marry an ugly
husband. I think a good-looking husband, even though poor, is to be
preferred to an ugly one, though he be emperor over the whole earth. So
you must go to the army and see what he is like, and then return. For,
my fortunate friend, Prudence<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11721src"
href="#xd27e11721" name="xd27e11721src">3</a> is your name, and
Prudence is your nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the princess had given this order to her confidante,
that girl managed to come to our camp, and after seeing you, prince,
went and said to that princess, &lsquo;My friend, I can say nothing but
this; even V&aacute;suki<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11726src" href=
"#xd27e11726" name="xd27e11726src">4</a> himself has not got a tongue
able to describe the beauty of that prince. So far however I can give
you an idea of it: as there is no woman in the world equal to you in
good looks, so there is no man equal to him. But alas! that is but a
feeble description of him; I believe in these three worlds there is no
Siddha, or Gandharva, or god like him.&rsquo; By this speech of her
confidante&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id="xd27e11729" title=
"Source: &#346;as&aacute;nkavat&iacute;&rsquo;s">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;&rsquo;s</span>
heart was fixed on you, and at the same moment it was nailed to you by
the god of love with his arrows. And from that time forth she has
remained desiring the welfare of you and also of her father, becoming
gradually attenuated by penance and the grief of separation from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So go secretly this very night, and carry off that princess
from that sanctuary of Gaur&iacute;, which is now unfrequented, and
bring her here without being observed. Let her be conveyed to the
palace of M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u; and then these kings, after
securing your rear against the fury of the foe, shall come there with
me. Let this fighting be put an end to. Do not allow any further
slaughter of soldiers. And ensure the personal safety of yourself and
the king your father-in-law. For war, that involves a great waste of
human life, is an inexpedient expedient, and sages affirm it to be the
worst of all political measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;rutadhi had said this to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, that
prince and his ministers mounted their horses and set out secretly at
night. And the prince arrived at the city of Ujjayin&iacute;, in which
only women, and children, and sleepy men were left, and entered it
easily, as the gates were kept by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398"
href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>only a few drowsy
guards.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11738src" href="#xd27e11738" name=
"xd27e11738src">5</a> And then he proceeded to that famous sanctuary of
Gaur&iacute;, which was easily discovered by the description which
&#346;rutadhi had given of it<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> It was situated in a great garden called
Pushpakar&#7751;&#7693;a, and was just then illuminated by the rays of

<p>In the meanwhile &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, who remained
sleepless, though her companions, worn out by attendance and other
fatigues, were sleeping around her, was saying to herself; &ldquo;Alas!
for my sake brave kings and princes and heroes are being slain every
day in battle in both these armies. Moreover, that prince, who has
appealed to the ordeal of battle for my sake, was long ago designated
as my husband by the goddess Durg&aacute; in a dream; and the god of
love has with unfailing aim cut out my heart with a continual
shower<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11752src" href="#xd27e11752" name=
"xd27e11752src">7</a> of arrows, and taken it, and presented it to him.
But, ill-starred girl that I am, my father will not give me to that
prince, on account of the previous enmity between them, and his own
pride; so much I gathered from his letter. So what is the use of a sure
revelation by a goddess in a dream, when Fate is adverse? The fact is,
I see no chance of obtaining my beloved in any way. So, why should I
not abandon my hopeless life, before I hear of some misfortune
happening to my father or to my lover in battle?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11761src" href="#xd27e11761" name="xd27e11761src">8</a>&rdquo;
With these words she rose up, and in her grief went in front of the
image of Gaur&iacute; and made a noose with her outer garment,
fastening it to an <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, with his companions,
entered that garden and fastened his horse to a tree in front of the
temple and sanctuary of Gaur&iacute;. Then
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta&rsquo;s minister Vimalabuddhi, seeing the
princess near, said of his own accord to the prince, &ldquo;Look
prince, here is some lovely girl trying to hang herself; now, who can
she be?&rdquo; When the prince heard that, he looked at her and said,
&ldquo;Dear me! who can this girl be? Is she the goddess Rati? Or is
she happiness incarnate in bodily form? Or is she the beauty of the
moon, having taken shape,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11772src" href=
"#xd27e11772" name="xd27e11772src">9</a> or the command of Cupid living
and walking? Or is she a nymph of heaven? No, that cannot be. For what
can make heavenly nymphs desire to hang themselves? So let us remain
here for a time concealed by the trees, until we find out for certain,
somehow or other, who she is.&rdquo; When he had said this, he and his
ministers remained there in concealment; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>and in the meanwhile
the despondent &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; offered this prayer
to the goddess, &ldquo;O adorable Gaur&iacute; that deliverest the
afflicted from their pain, grant that, though, owing to my sins in a
former state of existence, prince M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta has not
become my husband in this birth, he may become such in a future
life.&rdquo; When the princess had said this, she bowed before the
goddess, and fastened the noose round her neck with eyes moist with
tears.</p>
<p>At that moment her companions woke up, and distressed at not seeing
her, began to look for her, and quickly came where she was. And they
said, &ldquo;Alas, friend, what is this that you have undertaken? Out
on your rashness!&rdquo; With these words they removed the noose from
her neck. So, while the girl was standing there ashamed and despondent,
a voice came from the inner shrine of Gaur&iacute;&rsquo;s temple,
&ldquo;Do not despond, my daughter &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;;
that word, fair one, that I spake to thee in a dream, cannot prove
false. Here is that husband of thine in a former life,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, come to thy side; go and enjoy with him the
whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; heard this sudden
utterance, she slowly looked aside a little confused, and at that
moment Vikramake&#347;arin, the minister of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta,
came up to her, and pointing out the prince with his finger, said to
her, &ldquo;Princess, Bhav&aacute;n&iacute; has told you the truth, for
here is the prince, your future husband, come to you, drawn by the
cords of love.&rdquo; When the princess heard that, she cast a sidelong
glance, and beheld that noble lover of hers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11786src" href="#xd27e11786" name="xd27e11786src">10</a> standing
in the midst of his companions, looking like the moon having descended
from heaven begirt by the planets, like the standard by which beauty is
tested in others, raining nectar into the eyes.</p>
<p>Then she remained motionless as a pillar, and every hair stood erect
with joy on all her limbs, so that they appeared to be covered with the
feathers at the end of Cupid&rsquo;s arrows raining upon her; and at
that moment M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta came up to her, and in order to
dispel her shame, he addressed to her, with a voice raining the honey
of love, the following speech appropriate to the occasion,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11797src" href="#xd27e11797" name=
"xd27e11797src">11</a> &ldquo;Fair one, you have made me leave my own
country and kingdom and relations, and brought me from a distance,
enslaving me and binding me with the chain of your virtues. So now I
have gained this fruit of my dwelling in the forest, and of my sleeping
on the ground, and of my living on wild fruits, and enduring the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>fierce heat of the sun, and of my emaciation
with asceticism, that I have beheld this form of yours which rains
nectar into my eyes. And if you love me enough to care to please me,
bestow also, gazelle-eyed one, that feast of the eyes upon the ladies
of our city. Let the war cease; let the welfare of both armies be
ensured; let my birth be made a success, and let my father&rsquo;s
blessing be gained for me at the same time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had said this to
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, she slowly answered with eyes
fixed on the ground, &ldquo;I indeed have been purchased with your
virtues and made your slave, so do, my husband, what you think will be
for our good.&rdquo; When M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta had been refreshed
by this nectar-like speech of hers, and saw that his point was gained,
he praised the goddess Gaur&iacute; and bowed before her, and then he
made the princess get up behind him on his horse, and his ten<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11808src" href="#xd27e11808" name=
"xd27e11808src">12</a> brave ministers mounted and took her
ladies-in-waiting up behind them; and then the prince, with his sword
drawn, set out from that city at night, accompanied by them sword in
hand. And though the city-guards saw those eleven heroes, they did not
dare to stop them, for they looked as formidable as so many angry
Rudras. And leaving Ujjayin&iacute;, they went with
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; to the palace of
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, in accordance with the advice of
&#346;rutadhi.</p>
<p>While the guards were exclaiming in their distraction, &ldquo;Who
are these, and whither are they gone?&rdquo; it gradually became known
in Ujjayin&iacute; that the princess had been carried off. And the
queen-consort hurriedly despatched the governor of the city to the
camp, to tell king Karmasena what had taken place. But in the meanwhile
the head of the scouts came to king Karmasena in the camp there at
night, and and said to him, &ldquo;King, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and
his ministers left the army secretly in the early part of this night,
and went on horseback to Ujjayin&iacute;, to carry off
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, who is in the temple of
Gaur&iacute;. So much I have discovered for certain; your Highness
knows what step it is now desirable to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When king Karmasena heard this, he sent for his general, and
communicated to him privately the information he had received, and said
to him, &ldquo;Choose five hundred swift horses, and set picked men on
them, and go with them secretly and rapidly to Ujjayin&iacute;, and
wherever you find that villain M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, kill him, or
make him prisoner: know that I will follow you quickly, leaving my army
behind me.&rdquo; When the general received this order from the king,
he said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and set out by night for
Ujjayin&iacute; with the prescribed force. And on the way he met the
governor of the town, from whom he heard that the princess had been
carried off by some daring men in another direction. Then he returned
with the governor of the town, and told king Karmasena what had taken
place. When the king heard it, he thought it impossible, and remained
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>quiet during the night, without making an
attack. And in the camp of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u and the other kings passed the night under
arms, by the advice of &#346;rutadhi.</p>
<p>And next morning the sagacious king Karmasena found out the real
state of the case, and sent off an ambassador to the kings in the camp
of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, and he instructed the ambassador to give
this message by word of mouth, &ldquo;M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta has
carried off my daughter by a stratagem; never mind that; for what other
man would be as suitable a match for her? So now let him come to my
palace, and do you come too, in order that I may celebrate my
daughter&rsquo;s marriage with appropriate ceremonies.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11824src" href="#xd27e11824" name=
"xd27e11824src">13</a> And the kings and &#346;rutadhi approved of this
proposal,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11827src" href="#xd27e11827" name=
"xd27e11827src">14</a> and said to the ambassador, &ldquo;Then let your
master retire to his own city, and we will ourselves go and bring the
prince there.&rdquo; When the ambassador heard that proposal, he went
and reported it to his master, and Karmasena agreed to it, and left for
Ujjayin&iacute; with his army. When the kings saw that, they went, with
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u at their head, and accompanied by
&#346;rutadhi, to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, with
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, had reached the palace of
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u in the city of K&aacute;nchanapura. There
the queens of M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u welcomed him, and his
companions, and his beloved, with becoming hospitality, and he rested
there with them, having successfully accomplished his object. And the
next day the kings came there with &#346;rutadhi; the heroic king of
the Kir&aacute;tas &#346;aktirakshita with his army, and the mighty
king M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u leader of the &#346;avaras, and the
hero Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha lord of the host of the M&aacute;tangas;
and all of them, when they beheld M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta united to
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; like the white water-lily to the
night, rejoiced and congratulated him. And after they had shewn him the
honour he deserved, they told him the message of Karmasena, and how he
had gone to his own palace.</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, having established there his camp,
that was like a moving city, sat down with them all to take counsel.
And he said to the kings and to his ministers, &ldquo;Tell me; shall I
go to Ujjayin&iacute; to be married, or not?&rdquo; And they with one
accord gave the following answer, &ldquo;That king is a villain; so how
can a visit to his palace turn out well?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11840src" href="#xd27e11840" name="xd27e11840src">15</a>
Moreover, there is no need of it, as his daughter has arrived
here.&rdquo; Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta said to the Br&aacute;hman
&#346;rutadhi, &ldquo;Why do you remain silent, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>Br&aacute;hman, like one taking no interest in
the proceedings? Tell me, do you approve of this step or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then &#346;rutadhi said, &ldquo;If you will listen, I will tell you
what I think: my opinion is that you ought to go to the palace of
Karmasena. For he sent you this message because he saw no other way out
of the difficulty; otherwise, how would a powerful prince like that,
when his daughter had been carried off, give up fighting, and go home?
Moreover, what could he do to you, when you arrived at his court, since
you would take your army with you? On the contrary, if you go there, he
will be well-disposed to you, and he will again be one of your chief
allies out of love for his daughter. The reason he makes this proposal,
which is a perfectly legitimate one, is that he does not wish his
daughter to be married in an irregular manner. So I think it advisable
that you should go to Ujjayin&iacute;.&rdquo; When &#346;rutadhi said
this, all, who were present, approved his speech, and said,
&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta said to them, &ldquo;I admit the
truth of all this; but I do not like to marry without my father and
mother. So let some one be sent off from this place to summon my father
and mother: and when I have learnt their wish, I will do what is
proper.&rdquo; When the hero had said this, he took the advice of his
friends, and then and there sent off his minister
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama to his parents.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile his father, king Amaradatta, in the city of
Ayodhy&aacute;, found out in course of time from his subjects that the
charge which Vin&iacute;tamati brought against the prince, and which
caused his banishment from his native land, was wholly groundless.
Then, in his wrath, he put to death that wicked minister and his
family, and fell into a pitiable state, being terribly afflicted on
account of the banishment of his son. And he left his capital, and
remained in a sanctuary of &#346;iva, outside the city, called
Nandigr&aacute;ma; and there he and his wives gave themselves up to
severe asceticism.</p>
<p>After he had remained there some time, Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama,
whose approach was announced by scouts, arrived, thanks to the speed of
his swift horse, at the city of Ayodhy&aacute;. He beheld that city
plunged in despair, on account of the absence of the prince, as if it
were once more going through the painful agitation caused by the exile
of R&aacute;ma. Thence he went to Nandigr&aacute;ma, surrounded by
citizens who asked him for news of the prince, and hearing from their
mouths what had happened to the king. There he beheld king Amaradatta,
with his body emaciated by asceticism, surrounded by his queens, eager
for news of his beloved son.</p>
<p>Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama went up to him and fell at his feet:
and the king embraced him, and asked for news of his son; and thereupon
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama said to him with tears; &ldquo;Your son
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta has won by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>valour the princess
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, the daughter of king Karmasena.
But, as he is devoted to his parents, it does not seem at all becoming
to him to marry her, unless the king and the queen can be present at
the ceremony. So your son, placing his head upon the ground, has sent
me to request you to come to him. And he awaits your Highness&rsquo;s
arrival, in K&aacute;nchanapura, in the palace of king
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u, the monarch of the &#346;avaras. Now hear
the story of our adventures.&rdquo; And thereupon
Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama began with the banishment of his master,
and related all his various and wonderful adventures, involving the
long story of the misfortunes of their forest sojourn and their
separation, with the war, and winding up with the prince&rsquo;s
reconciliation with Karmasena.</p>
<p>When king Amaradatta heard that, he made up his mind that it was
well with his son, and in his joy he announced that he would set out
that moment. He mounted an elephant, and accompanied by his queen, his
subject kings, and his ministers, and followed by a force of elephants
and cavalry, he started full of eagerness to join his son. And
travelling uninterruptedly, the king reached in a few days his
son&rsquo;s camp, that was pitched in the territory of the monarch of
the &#346;avaras.</p>
<p>And when M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who had long been yearning for
his father, heard of his approach, he went out to meet him with all the
kings. And he saw him from a distance, and dismounted from his horse,
and fell at the feet of his father, who was seated on an elephant, and
at the feet of his mother. And when embraced by his father, he filled
with his body his clasping arms, with satisfaction his heart, and his
eyes with tears. His mother too folded him in a long embrace, and
looking at him again and again, was for some time unable to let him go,
as if fearing a second separation. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta
introduced to his father Amaradatta the kings his friends, and they
bowed before him and the queen. And that couple, the king and the
queen, received lovingly those friends who had stood by their only son
in his difficulties.</p>
<p>Then Amaradatta entered the palace of M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u,
and saw <span class="corr" id="xd27e11867" title=
"Source: Sa&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;">&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;</span>,
his future daughter-in-law, who bowed at his feet. And after accepting
a present, he departed with the queen and that daughter-in-law, and
took up his quarters in his own camp. And there he took food with his
son and all the kings, and spent that day agreeably with song, music,
and dancing. And he thought that all his objects in life had been
gained, thanks to his son M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, the future
emperor, who had attained so much glory.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the wise king Karmasena, after deliberating,
sent off an ambassador to M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta with the following
message, which was contained in a letter, and also intended to be
delivered by word of mouth; &ldquo;I know that you will not come to
Ujjayin&iacute;; so I will send to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404"
href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>you my own son Sushe&#7751;a;
he will bestow on you with due ceremonies his sister
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;; so you ought not, blameless one,
to marry her in an irregular manner, if you value my
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the prince had heard this message delivered in the royal
hall of audience, his father the king himself gave this answer to the
ambassador; &ldquo;Who but king Karmasena would send such a gracious
message? That excellent monarch is truly well-disposed to us; so let
him send here his son Sushe&#7751;a; we will so order matters as that
his daughter&rsquo;s marriage shall give him satisfaction.&rdquo; When
the king had given this answer and dismissed the messenger with due
honours, he said to his son, and &#346;rutadhi, and the kings,
&ldquo;We had better go now to Ayodhy&aacute;; that is the place where
the marriage can be performed with most <i lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>;
and there we can entertain Sushe&#7751;a with becoming magnificence.
And let king M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u wait here for Sushe&#7751;a;
when that prince arrives he can come on after us to Ayodhy&aacute; with
him. But we will go on in front to make the necessary preparations for
the marriage.&rdquo; And all present approved this speech of the
king&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, the king with the queen and his soldiers, and
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta with the kings and his ministers, started
off with &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, exulting in their
success, leaving M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u to wait there for
Sushe&#7751;a. Their army moved on <a id="xd27e11881" name=
"xd27e11881"></a>like a deep and terrible sea, agitated with hundreds
of waves in the form of troops of bounding horses, filling all the
horizon with a flood of countless marching footmen, rendering all other
sounds inaudible with the confused din that arose from it. And
gradually advancing, father and son reached the palace of
&#346;aktirakshita the king of the Kir&aacute;tas, that lay in their
course.</p>
<p>There they and their attendants were courteously and generously
welcomed with heaps of valuable jewels, gold, and splendid garments.
And they stayed there one day with their army, taking food and resting,
and then they set out and reached in course of time their city of
Ayodhy&aacute;. It seemed like a lake in windy weather, as they entered
it: for the ladies of the city that had climbed up to the windows of
the palaces, as they moved to and fro, seemed like swaying full-blown
lotuses, sending forth shoots of beauty; and their rolling eyes eager
to behold the prince, who after a long absence had returned, bringing a
bride with him, were like dancing blue lilies; it was crowded with
assembling kingly swans; and tossing with wavy banners. And father and
son looked grand, as they sat on thrones, being blessed by the
Br&aacute;hmans, praised by heralds, and hymned by bards.</p>
<p>And when the people there saw the great beauty of
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, they exclaimed in their
astonishment, &ldquo;If they were to behold this daughter of Karmasena,
the Ocean would cease to boast of the beauty of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>daughter Lakshm&iacute;, and the Him&aacute;laya
would no longer pride himself on Gaur&iacute;.&rdquo; And then, when
the festival came on, the quarters, re-echoing the sound of the
auspicious drums of rejoicing, as it were, gave notice to the kings.
And the whole city was full of exultation, and the vermilion colours
that covered it throughout, seemed like its red glow of affection
overflowing in external form.</p>
<p>The next day the astrologers fixed an auspicious date for the
prince&rsquo;s marriage, and his father king Amaradatta began to make
preparations for it. And the city was filled so full of various jewels,
coming from all quarters, that it put to shame the city of Kuvera.</p>
<p>And soon a servant of king M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u&rsquo;s came
to the sovereign in high spirits, introduced by the warder, and said to
him, &ldquo;King, prince Sushe&#7751;a and king
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u have arrived, and they are both waiting on
the frontier of this realm of Ayodhy&aacute;.&rdquo; When king
Amaradatta heard that, he sent his own general with a body of soldiers
to meet Sushe&#7751;a. And M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, out of regard
for his friend, also went out with the general from Ayodhy&aacute; to
meet the prince. And both of those princes dismounted, while yet a
great distance apart, and met together, embracing one another and
asking after one another&rsquo;s health. And out of love they entered
the city in the same chariot, giving a great feast to the eyes of the
ladies of the city.</p>
<p>And there Sushe&#7751;a had an interview with the king, and was
received by him with much respect, and then he went to the private
apartments of his sister &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;. There she
rose up weeping and embraced him, and he sat down, and said to the
princess who was overwhelmed with shame, &ldquo;My father directs me to
tell you that you have done nothing unbecoming, for he has just come to
learn that prince M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta was appointed your husband
by the goddess Gaur&iacute; in a dream, and it is the highest duty of
women to follow the steps of their husbands.&rdquo; When he said this
to the girl, she dismissed her shame, looking at her heart with
downcast face, as if to tell it that its desire was gained.</p>
<p>Then Sushe&#7751;a brought and gave to
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; in the presence of the king her own
accumulated wealth; two thousand <i>bh&aacute;ras</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11900src" href="#xd27e11900" name="xd27e11900src">16</a> of
gold, five camels heavily laden with jewelled ornaments, and another
treasure of gold. And he said, &ldquo;This is her own private property,
but, as for what her father has sent, I will give it her in due course
at the marriage altar.&rdquo; Then they all ate and drank, and spent
the day there in the king&rsquo;s presence in great comfort, with
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and his suite.</p>
<p>The next day dawned, the day fixed as auspicious, and
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta performed his own daily ceremony, of bathing
and so on; in which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href=
"#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>king himself displayed the utmost
interest, in his joy at the occasion. And then
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, though her beauty was sufficient
bridal ornament, was solemnly adorned by the ladies, only out of regard
for the good old custom, not because anything of the kind was needed.
Then the bride and bridegroom left the room in which the previous
ceremony took place, and in which Sushe&#7751;a presided, and ascended
the altar-platform, where a fire was burning. And on it the prince
received the hand of the princess, which was resplendent with the hues
of a lotus that she held, as Vish&#7751;u the hand of Lakshm&iacute;.
And when they circumambulated the fire, the face of
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; was red and tearful from heat and
smoke, though anger was far from her. And the handfuls of parched
grain, thrown into the fire, appeared like the laughs of the god of
Love, pleased with the success of his scheme. And when the first
handful was thrown, Sushe&#7751;a gave five thousand horses, and a
hundred elephants, and two hundred <i>bh&aacute;ras</i> of gold, and
twenty camels laden with loads of splendid raiment, valuable gems, and
pearl-ornaments. And at each subsequent sprinkling of grain,
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;&rsquo;s brother gave her a portion
of the wealth gained by the conquest of the earth, double that given at
the preceding.</p>
<p>Then M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, the auspicious ceremony of his
marriage having been performed, entered his own palace with his newly
married bride, &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, while the sound of
festal drums rose in the air. And the king, his father, gratified his
ministers and the citizens of his capital, with presents of elephants,
horses, garments, ornaments, meat, and drink, suited to the worth of
the recipient, beginning with the circle of dependent monarchs, and
ending with the parrots and pet <i>mainas</i>. And the king displayed
on this occasion such exceedingly lavish generosity that even the trees
had garments and gems fastened to them, and presented the appearance of
earthly wishing-trees.</p>
<p>Then the king and M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta feasted with the kings
and &#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; and Sushe&#7751;a, and spent
the rest of the day in a wine-party. Then, after the inhabitants of the
palace had eaten and drunk well, and enjoyed music and dancing, the
sun, having accomplished his journey, and having drunk up the moisture
of the earth, entered the cavern of the western mountain. And the glory
of the day, seeing that he had departed somewhere or other with the
evening that was all ablaze with a warm glow, ran after him in a fit of
jealous anger, and the birds flying to and fro seemed like her agitated
zone.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11923src" href="#xd27e11923" name=
"xd27e11923src">17</a> And then in due course appeared advancing the
wanton nymph Night, beautiful with her waving black robe of darkness,
and showing a face in which stars rolled for eyeballs, and the god of
Love waxed mighty. And the moon, own brother <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>to
the curved corner of an angry long-eyed beauty&rsquo;s eye, arose, and
glowing with fresh rosy colour, made itself the driving-hook of the
elephant of the eastern mountain. And the eastern quarter, that was
clear and bright with the departure of the darkness, bore a laughing
face, to which the moon, like a new shoot of the twining plant of Love,
formed an extemporized ear-ornament. And at night
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, after performing his evening devotions,
retired to his luxuriously appointed bed-chamber with his bride
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;. And during it, that fair
one&rsquo;s moonlike countenance, dispelling the darkness, and lighting
up the pictured panels of the room, seemed to render unnecessary the
lamps hanging there, that were made of precious stones.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11928src" href="#xd27e11928" name=
"xd27e11928src">18</a> And the next morning M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta
was aroused by the soft sweet strains of the following song, &ldquo;The
night has past; leave your bed, prince, for the breezes of morning are
blowing, fanning the perfumed locks of the gazelle-eyed fair ones. And
the dewdrops collected on the points of the blades of
<i>d&uacute;rva</i>-grass sparkle brilliantly, looking like pearls
fallen from the necklace of the night quickly following the moon. And
observe, prince, the bees that long sported in the cups of the white
water-lilies opening when touched by the beams of the moon, and drank
the honey, and were joyous at having obtained an entrance, now that the
water-lilies are closed and their glory is departing, are seeking some
other retreat; for to whom are black souls faithful in calamity? And
the god of Love, seeing that the lip of night has been adorned by the
finger of the sun, has stripped it of the moon which served it for a
beauty-patch, and has gradually dissipated the darkness which was a
black powder to set it off.&rdquo; Aroused by these strains at the hour
of dawn, M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta cast off sleep, and leaving
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, at once started up from his couch.
And he rose and performed the ceremonies of the day, his father having
made all the arrangements that devolved on him; and accompanied by his
beloved he passed many more days in similar rejoicing. Then his father,
Amaradatta, first inaugurated the prince&rsquo;s brother-in-law
Sushe&#7751;a with the holy waters, and placed a turban of honour on
his head; and bestowed on him as a mark of respect a suitable territory
and elephants, horses, quantities of gold, and garments, and a hundred
beautiful women. And then the king complimented the king of the
&#346;avaras and the king of the Kir&aacute;tas,
M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u and &#346;aktirakshita, with their
relations and wives, and that king Durgapi&#347;&aacute;cha the leader
of the host of the M&aacute;tangas, and the ministers of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta with &#346;rutadhi, by giving them
territories, cows, horses, gold and garments. Then king Amaradatta
dismissed the king of the Kir&aacute;tas and the other monarchs, with
Sushe&#7751;a, to their own dominions: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>and ruled his realm
in happiness, at ease because his valour was so well known.
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, for his part, having conquered his enemies,
and attained his ends, remained in happiness with his wife
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, whom he had gained after a long
struggle, and with Bh&iacute;mapar&aacute;krama and his other
ministers.</p>
<p>And in course of time old age, slowly creeping on, approached the
root of the ear of that king Amaradatta, appearing as if it had taken
form in order to say to him, &ldquo;You have enjoyed the good things of
fortune; your age is fully ripe; surely it is now time to retire from
the world.&rdquo; Then the king&rsquo;s mind became averse to
enjoyment, and he said to his ministers, &ldquo;Listen, I will now tell
you the scheme which I have in my mind. My life has passed; that grey
hue which is the harbinger of Death has just now twitched my locks; and
when old age once arrives, a vicious clinging to enjoyment on the part
of persons like myself, when all the zest is gone, is mere vanity. And
though in some people a mad passion of avarice and lust goes on
increasing with increasing age, that is without doubt the natural
tendency of base souls, and the good do not acquire it. Now I have this
son here M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, who has gained glory by conquering
the sovereign of Avanti and his allied kings<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11946src" href="#xd27e11946" name="xd27e11946src">19</a>, who
abounds in good qualities, is beloved by the subjects, and has
excellent friends. So I propose to make over to him my mighty kingdom,
and to retire to a holy water for mortification of the flesh; conduct
in conformity with the laws laid down for the various periods of life,
that their enemies cannot blame, becomes men of great soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the calm and resolute ministers heard this determined speech of
the king&rsquo;s, they, and in due course the queen and the citizens
all approved it, saying, &ldquo;So let it be!&rdquo; Then the king
performed the joyful ceremony of the coronation<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11957src" href="#xd27e11957" name="xd27e11957src">20</a> of his
son M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta at a moment fixed by the astrologers, on
a day selected by the chief Br&aacute;hmans assembled together. And on
that day the palace of the king was full of people running hither and
thither at the order of the warder, and all the officials in it had
their hands full, and it reeled with the merriment of famous bards and
of lovely women who were dancing there. And while the water of holy
places was being poured in copious showers upon the head of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and his wife, a second flood seemed to gush
from the eyes of his joyful parents. And, when that new king, of
lion-like might, mounted his lion-seat, it seemed as if his enemies,
bowed down by fear of his wrath, crouched on the ground in a fashion
other than lion-like. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href=
"#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then his father, king Amaradatta, <span class="corr" id="xd27e11963"
title="Source: prolongued">prolonged</span> for seven days the great
feast, in which the king&rsquo;s highway was decorated, and the subject
kings honoured according to their worth. And on the eighth day he went
out of the city with his wife, and after turning back
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta and the citizens, who followed him with
tearful faces, he went with his ministers to
V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;. There the king remained with his
body steeped in Ganges water, worshipping &#346;iva three times a day,
performing penance, like a hermit, by living on roots and fruits; and
his wife shared all his devotions and privations.</p>
<p>But M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta, for his part, having obtained that
kingdom broad and pure as the sky, which the sun takes as his domain,
and having overwhelmed the kings with imposition of numerous tributes,
as the sun does the mountains with showers of rays, began to blaze
forth with increasing heat of valour. And associated with his
lieutenants M&aacute;y&aacute;va&#7789;u and Karmasena and the others,
and with his own ministers headed by &#346;rutadhi, he conquered this
circle of the earth, with all its continents, as far as the four
cardinal points, and ruled it under one umbrella. And while he was
king, such calamities as famine, and the dread of robbers and of
foreign invaders were heard of only in tales; and the world was ever
joyous and happy, and enjoyed unparalleled felicity, so that it seemed
as if the gentle reign of R&aacute;ma the good were renewed. And so the
monarch established himself in that city of Ayodhy&aacute; with his
ministers, and kings came from various quarters to worship the lotus of
his foot, and he long enjoyed with his beloved
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; pleasures the joy of which no enemy
marred.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11968src" href="#xd27e11968" name=
"xd27e11968src">21</a></p>
<p>When the hermit Pi&#347;angaja&#7789;a had told this story in the
wood on the Malaya mountain to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was
separated from his beloved, he went on to say to him, &ldquo;So, my
son, as M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkadatta in old time gained
&#346;a&#347;&aacute;nkavat&iacute; after enduring affliction, you also
will regain your Madanamanchuk&aacute;.&rdquo; When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta had heard this nectarous utterance of the mighty
hermit Pi&#347;angaja&#7789;a, he conceived in his heart the hope of
regaining Madanamanchuk&aacute;. And with his mind fixed on her, he
took leave of that good hermit, and roamed about on the Malaya
mountain, looking for Lalitalochan&aacute;, whom he had lost, the fair
one that originally brought him there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, afflicted
with separation, being without Madanamanchuk&aacute;, roamed about on
those lower slopes of mount Malaya, and in its bordering forests, which
were in all the beauty of spring, but found joy nowhere. The cluster of
mango-blossoms, though in itself soft, yet seeming, on account of the
bees<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11994src" href="#xd27e11994" name=

god of Love, cleft his heart. And the song of the cuckoo, though sweet
in itself, was hard to bear, and gave pain to his ears, as it seemed to
be harsh with the reproachful utterances of M&aacute;ra.<a class=

of it by those groves that were all resonant with the hum of bees.</p>
<p>And gradually, as he journeyed on, with the deity for his guide, by
a path that led towards the Ganges, he reached the bank of a lake in a
neighbouring wood. And there he beheld two young Br&aacute;hmans of

unrestrained conversation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href=

<h3 class="main">The first Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s story.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the territory of Kalinga a city of the
name of &#346;obh&aacute;vat&iacute;, which has never been entered by
the demon Kali, nor touched by evildoers, nor seen by a foreign foe:
such has it been made by the Creator. In it there was a wise and rich
Br&aacute;hman, of the name of Ya&#347;askara, who had offered many
sacrifices, and he had an excellent wife named Mekhal&aacute;. I was
born to them as an only son, when they were already in middle life, and
I was in due course reared up by them, and invested with the
sacrificial thread.</p>
<p>Then, while as a boy I was studying the Vedas, there arose a mighty
famine in that land, owing to drought. So my father and my mother went
off with me to a city named Vi&#347;&aacute;l&aacute;, taking with them
their wealth and their servants. In that city, in which fortune and
learning dwelt together, having laid aside their long feud, my father
established himself, having had a house given him by a merchant, who
was a friend of his. And I dwelt there in the house of my preceptor,
engaged in the acquisition of learning, in the society of my
fellow-students of equal age.</p>
<p>And among them I had a friend, a promising young man of the military
caste, Vijayasena by name, the son of a very rich Kshatriya. And one
day the unmarried sister of that friend of mine, whose name was
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;, came with him to my teacher&rsquo;s house. So
beautiful was she that I feel convinced that the Creator made the orb
of the moon, that is like nectar to the eyes of men, out of the
overflowing of the perfect loveliness of her face. I ween, the god of
Love, when he beheld her form, which was to him a sixth weapon,
bewildering the world, valued but little his other five shafts. When I
saw her, and heard from that friend her name and descent, I was at once
overpowered by Love&rsquo;s potent sway, and my mind was altogether
fixed upon her. And she, for her part, looked askance at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>me
with modest loving eye, and the down standing erect on her cheeks told
that love had begun to sprout. And after she had remained there a long
time on the pretext of play, she at last tore herself away and went
home, sending to me from the reverted corner of her eye a look that was
a messenger of love.</p>
<p>Then I went home, grieved at having to part with her, and throwing
myself flat, I tossed up and down convulsively like a fish on dry land.
I said to myself, &ldquo;Shall I ever again behold her face, which is
the Creator&rsquo;s storehouse of all the nectar of beauty? Happy are
her companions<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12023src" href="#xd27e12023"
name="xd27e12023src">5</a> whom she looks at with that laughing eye,
and talks freely to with that mouth.&rdquo; Engaged in such thoughts as
these, I with difficulty got through that day and night, and on the
second day I went to the house of my teacher.</p>
<p>There my friend Vijayasena approached me courteously, and in the
course of a confidential conversation, said to me joyfully, &ldquo;My
mother has heard from my sister Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; that you are
so great a friend of mine, and being full of love for you, she wishes
to behold you; so, if you have any regard for me, come with me to our
house; let it be adorned for us with the dust of your lotus-like
foot.&rdquo; This speech of his was a sudden refreshment to me, as an
unexpected heavy shower of rain is to a traveller in the desert. So I
consented, and went to his house, and there I had an interview with his
mother, and was welcomed by her, and remained there gladdened by
beholding my beloved.</p>
<p>Then Vijayasena, having been summoned by his father, left me, and
the foster-sister of Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; came to me, and said,
bowing before me, &ldquo;Prince, the princess Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;
trained up to maturity in our garden a jasmine creeper; and it has
recently produced a splendid crop of flowers, which laugh and gleam
with joyous exultation at being united with the spring. To-day the
princess herself has gathered its buds, in defiance of the bees that
settled on the flowers; and she has threaded them, like pearls, into a
necklace, and she sends this to you her old friend as a new
present.&rdquo; When that dexterous girl had said this, she gave me the
garland, and with it leaves of the betel, together with camphor and the
five fruits. So I threw round my neck the garland, which my beloved had
made with her own hand, and I enjoyed exceeding pleasure, surpassing
the joy of many embraces.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12039src" href=
"#xd27e12039" name="xd27e12039src">6</a> And putting the betel into my
mouth, I said to that dear companion of hers, &ldquo;What can I say
more than this, my good girl? I have in my heart such intense love for
your companion, that, if I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>could sacrifice my life for her, I
should consider that it had not been given me in vain; for she is the
sovereign of my being.&rdquo; When I had said this, I dismissed her,
and I went to my teacher&rsquo;s house with Vijayasena, who had that
moment come in.</p>
<p>The next day Vijayasena came with Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; to our
house, to the great delight<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12049src" href=
"#xd27e12049" name="xd27e12049src">7</a> of my parents. So the love of
myself and Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;, though carefully concealed,
increased every day from being in one another&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>And one day a servant of Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s said to me
in secret, &ldquo;Listen, noble sir, and lay up<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12060src" href="#xd27e12060" name="xd27e12060src">8</a> in your
heart what I am going to tell you. Ever since my darling
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; beheld you there in your teacher&rsquo;s
house, she has no appetite for her food, she does not adorn herself,
she takes no pleasure in music, she does not play with her parrots and
other pets; she finds that fanning with plantain leaves, and moist
anointings with sandal-wood ointment, and the rays of the moon, though
cool as snow, torture her with heat; and every day she grows
perceptibly thinner, like the streak of the moon in the black
fortnight, and the only thing that seems to give her any relief is
conversation about you; this is what my daughter told me, who knows all
that she does, who attends her like a shadow, and never leaves her
side. Moreover, I drew Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; herself into a
confidential conversation, and questioned her, and she confessed to me
that her affections were fixed on you. So now, auspicious sir, if you
wish her life to be saved, take steps to have her wishes
fulfilled.&rdquo; This nectarous speech of hers delighted me, and I
said, &ldquo;That altogether depends on you, I am completely at your
disposal.&rdquo; When she heard this, she returned delighted, and I,
relying on her, conceived hopes, and went home with my mind at
ease.</p>
<p>The next day an influential young Kshatriya came from
Ujjayin&iacute; and asked Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s father for
her hand. And her father promised to give him his daughter; and I heard
that news, terrible to my ears, from her attendants. Then I was for a
long time amazed, as if fallen from heaven, as if struck with a
thunderbolt, as if possessed by a demon. But I recovered, and said to
myself, &ldquo;What is the use of bewilderment now? I will wait and see
the end. It is the self-possessed man that gains his desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buoyed up by such hopes I passed some days, and my beloved
one&rsquo;s companions came to me and supported me by telling me what
she said; but at last Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; was informed that the
auspicious moment had been fixed, and the day of her marriage arrived
celebrated with great rejoicings. So she was shut up in her
father&rsquo;s house, and prevented from roaming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>about at will, and the processional entry of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s friends drew nigh, heralded by the sound of
drums.</p>
<p>When I saw that, I considered that my miserable life had lost all
its zest, and came to the conclusion that death was to be preferred to
separation; so I went outside the city, and climbed up a
<i>banyan</i>-tree, and fastened a noose to it, and I let myself drop
from the tree suspended by that noose, and let go at the same time my
chimerical hope of obtaining my beloved. And a moment afterwards I
found myself, having recovered the consciousness which I had lost,
lying in the lap of a young man who had cut the noose; and perceiving
that he had without doubt saved my life, I said to him, &ldquo;Noble
sir, you have to-day shewn your compassionate nature; but I am tortured
by separation from my beloved and I prefer death to life. The moon is
like fire to me, food is poison, songs pierce my ear like needles, a
garden is a prison, a wreath of flowers is a series of envenomed
shafts, and anointing with sandal-wood ointment and other unguents is a
rain of burning coals. Tell me, friend, what pleasure can wretched
bereaved ones, like myself, to whom everything in the world is turned
upside down, find in life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had said this, that friend in misfortune asked me my history,
and I told him the whole of my love affair with
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;. Then that good man said to me, &ldquo;Why,
though wise, are you bewildered? What is the use of surrendering life,
for the sake of which we acquire all other things?&rdquo; <i>&Agrave;
propos</i> of this, hear my story, which I now proceed to relate to
you.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The second Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s story.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the bosom of the Him&aacute;layas a
country named Nishada, which is the only refuge of virtue, banished
from the earth by Kali, and the native land of truth, and the home of
the K&#7771;ita age. The inhabitants of that land are insatiable of
learning, but not of money-getting; they are satisfied with their own
wives, but with benefiting others never. I am the son of a
Br&aacute;hman of that country who was rich in virtue and wealth. I
left my home, my friend, out of a curiosity which impelled me to see
other countries, and wandering about, visiting teachers, I reached in
course of time the city of &#346;ankhapura not far from here, where
there is a great purifying lake of clear water, sacred to
&#346;ankhap&aacute;la king of the N&aacute;gas, and called
&#346;ankhahrada.</p>
<p>While I was living there in the house of my spiritual preceptor, I
went one holy bathing festival to visit the lake &#346;ankhahrada. Its
banks were crowded, and its waters troubled on every side by people who
had come from all countries, like the sea when the gods and Asuras
churned it. I beheld that great lake, which seemed to make the women
look more lovely, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416"
name="pb416">416</a>]</span>as their garlands of flowers fell from
their loosened braids, while it gently stroked their waists with its
waves like hands, and made itself slightly yellow with the unguents
which its embraces rubbed off from their bodies. I then went to the
south of the lake, and beheld a clump of trees, which looked like the
body of Cupid being consumed by the fire of &#346;iva&rsquo;s eye; its
<i>l&aacute;pinchas</i> did duty for smoke, its <i>kin&#347;ukas</i>
for red coals, and it was all aflame with twining masses of the
full-blown scarlet <i>a&#347;oka</i>.</p>
<p>There I saw a certain maiden gathering flowers at the entrance of an
arbour composed of the <i>atimukta</i> creeper; she seemed with her
playful sidelong glances to be threatening the lotus in her ear; she
kept raising her twining arm and displaying half her bosom; and her
beautiful loosened hair, hanging down her back, seemed like the
darkness seeking shelter to escape from her moon-like face. And I said
to myself &ldquo;Surely the Creator must have made this girl, after he
had got his hand in by creating Rambh&aacute; and her sister-nymphs,
but one can see that she is mortal by the winking of her
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment I saw that gazelle-eyed maid, she pierced my heart, like
a crescent-headed javelin of M&aacute;ra, bewildering the three worlds.
And the moment she saw me, she was overcome by Cupid, and her hands
were rendered nerveless and listless by love, and she desisted from her
amusement of gathering flowers. She seemed, with the flashings of the
ruby in the midst of her moving flexible chain,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12111src" href="#xd27e12111" name="xd27e12111src">9</a> to be
displaying the flames of affection that had broken forth from her heart
in which they could not be contained; and turning round, she looked at
me again and again with an eye that seemed to be rendered more charming
by the pupil coming down to rest in its corner.</p>
<p>While we stood for a while looking at one another, there arose there
a great noise of people flying in terror. And there came that way an
infuriated elephant driven mad by the smell of the wild elephants; it
had broken its chain, and thrown its rider, and the elephant-hook was
swinging to and fro at the end of its ear. The moment I saw the animal,
I rushed forward, and taking up in my arms my beloved, who was
terrified, and whose attendants had run away, I carried her into the
middle of the crowd. Then she began to recover her composure, and her
attendants came up; but just at that moment the elephant, attracted by
the noise of the people, charged in our direction. The crowd dispersed
in terror at the monster&rsquo;s approach, and she disappeared among
them, having been carried off by her attendants in one direction, while
I went in another.</p>
<p>At last the alarm caused by the elephant came to an end, and then I
searched in every direction for that slender-waisted maid, but I could
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>not find her, as I did not know her name, her
family, or her dwelling-place; and so roaming about, with a void in my
heart, like a Vidy&aacute;dhara that has lost his magic power, I with
difficulty tottered into my teacher&rsquo;s house. There I remained
like one in a faint or asleep, remembering the joy of embracing my
beloved, and anxious lest her love might fail.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12120src" href="#xd27e12120" name="xd27e12120src">10</a> And in
course of time reflection lulled me in her lap, as if affected with the
compassion natural to noble women, and shewed me a glimpse of hope, and
soul-paining ignorance hugged my heart, and an exceedingly severe
headache took possession of my brain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12126src" href="#xd27e12126" name="xd27e12126src">11</a> In the
meanwhile the day slipped away and my self-command with it, and the
lotus-thicket folded its cups and my face was contracted with them, and
the couples of Brahmany ducks were dispersed with my hopes, the sun
having gone to rest.</p>
<p>Then the moon, the chief friend of Love, that gladdens the eyes of
the happy, rose up, adorning the face of the east; its rays, though
ambrosial, seemed to me like fiery fingers, and though it lit up the
quarters of the sky, it closed in me all hope of life. Then one of my
fellow-students, seeing that in my misery I had flung my body into
moonlight as into a fire, and was longing for death, said to me,
&ldquo;Why are you in this evil case? You do not appear to have any
disease; but, if you have mental affliction caused by longing for
wealth or by love, I will tell you the truth about those objects;
listen to me. The wealth, which through over-covetousness men desire to
gain by cheating their neighbours, or by robbing them, does not remain.
The poison-trees<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12137src" href=
"#xd27e12137" name="xd27e12137src">12</a> of wealth, which are rooted
in wickedness and bring forth an abundant crop of wickedness, are soon
broken by the weight of their own fruit. All that is gained by that
wealth in this world, is the toil of acquiring it and other annoyances,
and in the next world great suffering in hell, a suffering that shall
continue as long as the moon and stars endure. As for love, that love
which fails of attaining its object brings disappointment that puts an
end to life, and unlawful love, though pleasing in the mouth, is simply
the forerunner of the fire of hell<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span><a class="noteref" id="xd27e12172src" href=
"#xd27e12172" name="xd27e12172src">13</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span><span class="corr"
id="xd27e12188" title="Source: But">but</span> a man&rsquo;s mind is
sound owing to good actions in a former life, and a hero, who possesses
self-command and energy, obtains wealth, and the object of his desires,
not a spiritless coward like you. So, my good fellow, have recourse to
self-command, and strive for the attainment of your ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that friend said this to me I returned him a careless and
random answer. However, I concealed my real thoughts, spent the night
in a calm and composed manner, and in course of time came here, to see
if by any chance she lived in this town. When I arrived here, I saw you
with your neck in a noose, and after you were cut down, I heard from
you your sorrow, and I have now told you my own.</p>
<p>So I have made efforts to obtain that fair one whose name and
dwelling-place I know not, and have thus exerted myself to gain what no
heroism could procure; but why do you, when <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e12195" title=
"Source: Madirav&aacute;t&iacute;">Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;</span> is
within your grasp, play the faint-heart, instead of manfully striving
to win her? Have you not heard the legend of old days with regard to
Rukmi&#7751;&iacute;? Was she not carried off by Vish&#7751;u after she
had been given to the king of Chedi?</p>
<p>While that friend of mine was thus concluding his tale,
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; came there with her followers, preceded by the
usual auspicious band of music, in order to worship the god of Love in
this temple of the Mothers. And I said to my friend, &ldquo;I knew all
along that maidens on the day of their marriage come here to worship
the god of Love, this is why I tried to hang myself on the
<i>banyan</i>-tree in front of this temple, in order that when
<span class="corr" id="xd27e12203" title=
"Source: Madir&aacute;vati">Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;</span> came here,
she might see that I had died for her sake.&rdquo; When that resolute
Br&aacute;hman friend heard that, he said, &ldquo;Then let us quickly
slip into this temple and remain hidden behind the images of the
Mothers, and see whether any expedient will then present itself to us
or not.&rdquo; When my friend made this proposal, I consented, and went
with him into that temple, and remained there concealed.</p>
<p>And Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; came there slowly, escorted by the
auspicious wedding music, and entered that temple. And she left at the
door all her female friends and male attendants, saying to them,
&ldquo;I wish in private to crave from the awful god of Love a certain
boon<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12209src" href="#xd27e12209" name=
"xd27e12209src">14</a> that is in my mind, so remain all of you outside
the building.&rdquo; Then she came in and addressed the following
prayer to K&aacute;madeva after she had worshipped him, &ldquo;O god,
since thou art named &lsquo;the mind-born,&rsquo; how was it that thou
didst not discern the beloved that was in my mind? Why hast thou
disappointed and slain me? If thou hast not been able to grant me my
boon in this birth, at any rate have mercy upon me in my next birth, O
husband of Rati. Shew me so much favour as to ensure that handsome
young Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s being my husband in my next birth.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the girl had said this in our hearing and before our eyes, she
made a noose by fastening her upper garment to a peg, and put it round
her neck. And my friend said to me, &ldquo;Go and shew yourself to her,
and take the noose from her neck;<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> so I immediately went towards her. And I
said to her with a voice faltering from excess of joy, &ldquo;Do not
act rashly, my beloved; see, here is your slave in front of you, bought
by you with the risk of your life, in whom affection has been produced
by your utterance in the moment of your grief;&rdquo; and with these
words I removed the noose from the neck of that fair one.</p>
<p>She immediately looked at me, and remained for a moment divided
between joy and terror, and then my friend said quickly to me,
&ldquo;As this is a dimly lighted hour owing to the waning of the day,
I will go out dressed in Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s garments with
her attendants. And do you go out by the second door, taking with you
this bride wrapped up in our upper garments. And make for whatever
foreign country you please, during the night, when you will be able to
avoid detection. And do not be anxious about me. Fate will bestow on me
prosperity.&rdquo; When my friend had said this, he put on
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s dress, and went out, and left that
temple in the darkness, surrounded by her attendants.</p>
<p>And I slipped out by another door with Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;, who
wore a necklace of priceless jewels, and went three <i>yojanas</i> in
the night. In the morning I took food, and slowly travelling on, I
reached in the course of some days, with my beloved, a city named
Achalapura. There a certain Br&aacute;hman shewed himself my friend,
and gave me a house, and there I quickly married
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;.</p>
<p>So I have been living there in happiness, having obtained my desire,
and my only anxiety has been as to what could have become of my friend.
And in course of time I came here to bathe in the Ganges, on this day
which is the festival of the summer solstice, and lo! I found here this
man who without cause shewed himself my friend. And full of
embarrassment I folded him in a long embrace, and at last made him sit
down and asked him to tell me his adventures, and at that moment your
Highness came up. Know, son of the king of Vatsa, that this other
Br&aacute;hman at my side is my true friend in calamity, to whom I owe
my life and my wife.</p>
<p>When one Br&aacute;hman had told his story in these words,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta said to the other Br&aacute;hman, &ldquo;I am
much pleased; now tell me, how did you escape from so great a danger?
For men like yourself, who disregard their lives for the sake of their
friends, are hard to find.&rdquo; When the second Br&aacute;hman heard
this speech of the son of the king of Vatsa, he also began to tell his
adventures. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=

<h3 class="main">Subsequent adventures of the second
Br&aacute;hman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When I went out that night from the temple in
Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s dress, her attendants surrounded me
under the impression that I was their mistress. And being bewildered
with dancing, singing and intoxication, they put me in a
palanquin<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12236src" href="#xd27e12236" name=
"xd27e12236src">15</a> and took me to the house of Somadatta, which was
in festal array. In one part it was full of splendid raiment, in
another of piled up ornaments; here you might see cooked food provided,
there an altar-platform made ready; one corner was full of singing
female slaves, another of professional mimes; and a third was occupied
by Br&aacute;hmans waiting for the auspicious moment.</p>
<p>Into one room of this house I was ushered in the darkness, veiled,
by the servants, who were beside themselves with drink and took me for
the bride. And when I sat down there, the females surrounded me, full
of joy at the wedding festival, busied with a thousand affairs.</p>
<p>Immediately the sound of bracelets and anklets was heard near the
door, and a maiden entered the room surrounded by her attendants. Like
a female snake, her head was adorned with flashing jewels, and she had
a white skin-like boddice; like a wave of the sea, she was full of
beauty,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12246src" href="#xd27e12246" name=
"xd27e12246src">16</a> and covered with strings of pearls. She had a
garland of beautiful flowers, arms shapely as the stalk of the creeper,
and bright bud-like fingers; and so she looked like the goddess of the
garden moving among men. And she came and sat down by my side, thinking
I was her beloved confidante. When I looked at her, I perceived that
that thief of my heart had come to me, the maiden that I saw at the
&#346;ankha lake whither she had come to bathe; whom I saved from the
elephant, and who, almost as soon as seen, disappeared from my sight
among the crowd. I was overpowered with excess of joy, and I said to
myself, &ldquo;Can this be mere chance, or is it a dream, or sober
waking reality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately those attendants of Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; said to the
visitor, &ldquo;Why do you seem so disturbed in mind, noble
lady?&rdquo; When she heard that, she said, concealing her real
feelings,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12251src" href="#xd27e12251" name=
"xd27e12251src">17</a> &ldquo;What! are you not aware what a dear
friend of mine Madir&aacute;vat&iacute; is. And she, as soon as she is
married, will go off to her father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and I shall
not be able to live without her; this is why I am afflicted. So leave
the room quickly, in order that I may have the pleasure of a little
confidential chat with Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words she put them all out, and fastened the door
herself, and then sat down, and under the impression that I was her
confidante, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>began to speak to me as follows;
&ldquo;Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;, no affliction can be greater than this
affliction of yours, in that you are in love with one man, and you are
given by your father in marriage to another; still you may possibly
have a meeting or be united with your beloved, whom you know by having
been in his society. But for me a hopeless affliction has arisen, and I
will tell you what it is; for you are the only repository of my
secrets, as I am of yours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had gone to bathe on a festival in the lake named the lake
of &#346;ankha,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12260src" href="#xd27e12260"
name="xd27e12260src">18</a> in order to divert my mind which was
oppressed with approaching separation from you. While thus engaged, I
saw in the garden near that lake a beautiful blooming young
Br&aacute;hman, whose budding beard seemed like a swarm of bees come to
feed on the lotus of his face; he himself looked like the moon come
down from heaven in the day, like the golden binding-post of the
elephant of beauty. I said to myself, &lsquo;Those hermits&rsquo;
daughters who have not seen this youth, have only endured to no purpose
hardship in the woods; what fruit have they of their asceticism?&rsquo;
And even as I thought this in my heart, the god of Love pierced it so
completely with his shafts, that shame and fear at once left it
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, while I looked with sidelong looks at him, whose eyes
were fixed on me, there suddenly came that way a furious elephant that
had escaped from its binding-post. That scared away my attendants and
terrified myself; and the young man, perceiving this, ran, and taking
me up in his arms, carried me along way into the midst of the crowd.
While in his arms, I assure you, my friend, I was rendered dead to all
beside by the joy of his ambrosial touch, and I knew not the elephant,
nor fear, nor who I was, nor where I was. In the meanwhile my
attendants came up, and thereupon the elephant rushed down on us like
Separation incarnate in bodily form, and my servants, alarmed at it,
took me up and carried me home; and in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> my
beloved disappeared, whither I know not. Ever since that time I do
nothing but think on him, who saved my life, but whose name and
dwelling I know not, who was snatched from me as one might snatch away
from my grasp a treasure that I had found; and I weep all night with
the female <i>chakrav&aacute;kas</i>, longing for sleep, that takes
away all grief, in order that I may behold him in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this hopeless affliction my only consolation, my friend,
is the sight of yourself, and that is now being far removed from me.
Accordingly, Madir&aacute;vat&iacute;, the hour of my death draws nigh,
and that is why I am now enjoying the pleasure of beholding your
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had uttered this speech, which was like a shower of nectar
in my ears, staining all the while the moon of her face with tear-drops
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>mixed with the black pigment of her eyes, she
lifted up the veil from my face, and beheld and recognized me, and then
she was filled with joy, wonder, and fear. Then I said, &ldquo;Fair
one, what is your cause of alarm? Here I am at your service. For Fate,
when propitious, brings about unexpected results. I too have endured
for your sake intolerable sorrow; the fact is, Fate produces a strange
variety of effects in this phenomenal universe. Hereafter I will tell
you my story at full length; this is not the time for conversation; now
devise, if you can, my beloved, some artifice for escaping from this
place.&rdquo; When I said this to the girl, she made the following
proposal, which was just what the occasion demanded; &ldquo;Let us slip
out quietly from this house by the back-door; the garden belonging to
the house of my father, a noble Kshatriya, is just outside: let us pass
through it and go where chance may take us.&rdquo; When she had said
this, she hid her ornaments, and I left the house with her by the way
which she recommended.</p>
<p>So in that night I went a long distance with her, for we feared
detection, and in the morning we reached together a great forest. And
as we were going along through that savage wilderness, with no comfort
but our mutual conversation, noon gradually came on. The sun, like a
wicked king, afflicted with his rays the earth that furnished no asylum
for travellers, and no shelter.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12285src"
href="#xd27e12285" name="xd27e12285src">19</a> By that time my beloved
was exhausted with fatigue and tortured with thirst, so I slowly
carried her into the shade of a tree, which it cost me a great effort
to reach.</p>
<p>There I tried to restore her by fanning her with my garment, and
while I was thus engaged, a buffalo that had escaped with a wound, came
towards us. And there followed in eager pursuit of it a man on
horseback armed with a bow, whose very appearance proclaimed him to be
a noble-minded hero. He slew that great buffalo with a second wound
from a crescent-headed arrow; striking him down as Indra strikes down a
mountain with the dint of a thunder-bolt. When he saw us, he advanced
towards us, and said kindly to me, &ldquo;Who are you, my good sir; and
who is this lady; and why have you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I shewed my Br&aacute;hmanical thread, and gave him an answer
which was half truth and half falsehood; &ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman,
this is my wife: business led us to a foreign land, and on the way our
caravan was destroyed by bandits, and we, separating from it, lost our
way, and so came to enter this forest; here we have met you, and all
our fears are at an end.&rdquo; When I said this, he was moved by
compassion for my Br&aacute;hmanical character, and said &ldquo;I am a
chief of the foresters, come here to hunt; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>you
way-worn travellers have arrived here as my guests; so now come to my
house, which is at no great distance, to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, he made my wearied darling got up on his
horse, and himself walked, and so he led us to his dwelling. There he
provided us with food and other requisites, as if he had been a
relation.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12300src" href="#xd27e12300" name=
"xd27e12300src">20</a> Even in bad districts some few noble-hearted men
spring up here and there. Then he gave me attendants, who enabled me to
get out of that wood, and I reached a royal grant to Br&aacute;hmans,
where I married that lady. Then I wandered about from country to
country, and meeting with a caravan, I have to-day come here with her
to bathe in the water of the Ganges. And here I have found this man
whom I selected for myself as a friend; and I have seen your Highness;
this, prince, is my story.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When he had said this, he ceased, and the prince of Vatsa loudly
praised that Br&aacute;hman, who had obtained the prize he desired, the
fitting reward of his genuine goodness; and in the meanwhile the
prince&rsquo;s ministers, Gomukha and the others, who had long been
roaming about looking for him, came up and found him. And they fell at
the feet of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and tears of joy poured down their
faces; while he welcomed them all with due and fitting respect. Then
the prince, accompanied by Lalitalochan&aacute;, returned with those
ministers to his city, taking with him those two young Br&aacute;hmans,
whom he valued on account of the tact and skill they had displayed in
attaining worthy objects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href=

<hr class="tb">
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, son of the king of Vatsa, possessing as
his wives those various ladies, the most beautiful in the three worlds,
and Madanamanchuk&aacute; as his head-queen, dwelt with Gomukha and his
other ministers in Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, having his every want
supplied by his father&rsquo;s magnificent resources. His days passed
pleasantly in dancing, singing, and conversation, and were enlivened by
the exquisite enjoyment of the society of the ladies whom he loved.</p>
<p>Then it happened one day that he could not find his principal
charmer Madanamanchuk&aacute; anywhere in the female apartments, nor
could her attendants find her either.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12329src" href="#xd27e12329" name="xd27e12329src">1</a> When he
could not see his beloved, he became pale from grief, as the moon loses
its beauty in the morning, by being separated from the night. And he
was distracted by an innumerable host of doubts, saying to himself,
&ldquo;I wonder whether my beloved has hidden herself somewhere to
ascertain my sentiments towards her; or is she indignant with me for
some trifling fault or other; or is she concealed by magic, or has she
been carried off by some one?&rdquo; When he had searched for her, and
could not find her anywhere, he was consumed by violent grief for his
separation from her, which raged in his bosom like a forest
conflagration. His father, the king of Vatsa, who came to visit him, as
soon as he knew the state of affairs, and his mothers, ministers, and
servants were all beside themselves. The pearl necklace, sandal-wood
ointment, the rays of the moon, lotus-fibres and lotus-leaves did not
alleviate his torture, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href=
"#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>rather increased it. As for
Kalingasen&aacute;, when she was suddenly deprived of that daughter,
she was confounded like a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, who has lost her
magic power.</p>
<p>Then an aged female guardian of the women&rsquo;s apartments said in
the presence of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, so that all there heard,
&ldquo;Long ago, that young Vidy&aacute;dhara, named M&aacute;nasavega,
having beheld Madanamanchuk&aacute;, when she was a maiden, on the top
of the palace, suddenly descended from heaven, and approaching
Kalingasen&aacute;, told her his name, and asked her to give him her
daughter. When Kalingasen&aacute; refused, he went as he came; but why
should he not have now come secretly and carried her off by his magic
power? It is of course true that heavenly beings do not carry off the
wives of others; on the other hand, who, that is blinded by passion,
troubles himself about the right or wrong of an action?&rdquo; When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this, his heart was overwhelmed with
anger, impatience, and the sorrow of bereavement, and became like a
lotus in the waves.</p>
<p>Then Ruma&#7751;vat said, &ldquo;This palace is guarded all round,
and it is impossible to enter or go out from it, except through the
air. Moreover, by the favour of &#346;iva no misfortune can befall her;
so we may be certain that she has hidden herself somewhere, because her
affection has been wounded. Listen to a story which will make this
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of S&aacute;vitr&iacute; and Angiras.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time a hermit, named Angiras, asked
Ash&#7789;&aacute;vakra for the hand of his daughter
S&aacute;vitr&iacute;. But Ash&#7789;&aacute;vakra would not give him
his daughter S&aacute;vitr&iacute;, though he was an excellent match,
because she was already betrothed to some one else. Then Angiras
married A&#347;rut&aacute; his brother&rsquo;s daughter, and lived a
long time with her as his wife in great happiness; but she was well
aware that he had previously been in love with
S&aacute;vitr&iacute;.</p>
<p>One day that hermit Angiras remained muttering for a long time in an
inaudible voice. Then his wife A&#347;rut&aacute; asked him again and
again lovingly, &ldquo;Tell me, my husband, why do you remain so long
fixed in thought?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;My dear, I am meditating on
the S&aacute;vitr&iacute;;&rdquo; and she, thinking that he meant
S&aacute;vitr&iacute;, the hermit&rsquo;s daughter, was vexed in soul.
She said to herself, &ldquo;He is miserable,&rdquo; so she went off to
the forest determined to abandon the body; and after she had prayed
that good fortune might attend her husband, she fastened a rope round
her neck. And at that moment G&aacute;yatr&iacute; appeared with rosary
of <i>aksha</i>-beads and ascetic&rsquo;s pitcher, and said to her,
&ldquo;Daughter, do not act rashly! Your husband was not thinking of
any woman; he was meditating on me, the holy
S&aacute;vitr&iacute;;&rdquo; and with these words she freed her neck
from the noose; and the goddess, merciful to her votaries, having thus
consoled her, disappeared. Then her husband Angiras, searching for her,
found her in the wood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href=
"#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>and brought her home. So you see
that women in this world cannot endure the wounding of their
affections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you may be certain that this wife of the prince is angry
on account of some trifling injury, and is hidden somewhere in this
place; for she is under the protection of &#346;iva; and we must again
search for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ruma&#7751;vat said this, the sovereign of Vatsa said,
&ldquo;It must be so: for no misfortune can befall her, inasmuch as a
heavenly voice said <span class="corr" id="xd27e12357" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>This Madanamanchuk&aacute; is an
incarnation of Rati, appointed by the god to be the wife of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who is an emanation of the god of Love, and he
shall rule the Vidy&aacute;dharas with her as his consort for a
<i>kalpa</i> of the gods,&rsquo; and this utterance cannot be falsified
by the event. So let her be carefully looked for.&rdquo; When the king
himself said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta went out, though he was in
such a miserable state.</p>
<p>But, however much he searched for her, he could not find her, so he
wandered about in various parts of the grounds, like one distracted;
when he went to her dwelling, the rooms with closed doors seemed as if
they had shut their eyes in despair at beholding his grief; and when he
went about in the groves asking for her, the trees, agitating their
shoots like hands seemed to say, &ldquo;We have not seen your
beloved.&rdquo; When he searched in the gardens, the
<i>s&aacute;rasa</i>-birds, flying up to the sky, seemed to tell him
that she had not gone that way. And his ministers Marubh&uacute;ti,
Hari&#347;ikha, Gomukha, and Vasantaka wandered about in every
direction to find her.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile an unmarried Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, of the name
of Vegavat&iacute;, having beheld Madanamanchuk&aacute; in her splendid
and glorious beauty, deliberately took her shape, and came and stood
alone in the garden under an <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree. Marubh&uacute;ti
saw her, as he was roaming about in search of the queen, and she seemed
at once to extract the dart from his pierced heart. And in his joy he
went to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and said to him, &ldquo;Cheer up, I
have seen your beloved in the garden.&rdquo; When he said this,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta was delighted, and immediately went with him to
that garden.</p>
<p>Then, exhausted with long bereavement, he beheld that semblance of
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, with feelings like those with which a thirsty
traveller beholds a stream of water. And the moment he beheld her, the
much afflicted prince longed to embrace her, but she, being cunning and
wishing to be married by him, said to him, &ldquo;Do not touch me now,
first hear what I have to say. Before I married you, I prayed to the
Yakshas to enable me to obtain you, and said, &lsquo;On my wedding-day
I will make offerings to you with my own hand.&rsquo; But, my beloved,
when my wedding-day came, I forgot all about them. That enraged the
Yakshas, and so they carried me off from this place. And they have just
brought me here, and let me go, saying, &lsquo;Go and perform over
again that ceremony of marriage, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb428" href="#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>make oblations to us,
and then repair to your husband; otherwise you will not prosper.&rsquo;
So marry me quickly, in order that I may offer the Yakshas the worship
they demand; and then fulfil all your desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard that, he summoned the priest
&#346;&aacute;ntisoma and at once made the necessary preparations, and
immediately married the supposed Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who was no
other than the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; Vegavat&iacute;, having been
for a short time quite cast down by his separation from the real one.
Then a great feast took place there, full of the clang of cymbals,
delighting the king of Vatsa, gladdening the queens, and causing joy to
Kahngasen&aacute;. And the supposed Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who was
really the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; Vegavat&iacute;, made with her own
hand an offering of wine, flesh, and other dainties to the Yakshas.
Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, remaining with her in her chamber, drank
wine with her in his exultation, though he was sufficiently intoxicated
with her voice. And then he retired to rest with her, who had thus
changed her shape, as the sun with the shadow. And she said to him in
secret, &ldquo;My beloved, now that we have retired to rest, you must
take care not to unveil my face suddenly and look at me while
asleep<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12379src" href="#xd27e12379" name=
"xd27e12379src">2</a>.&rdquo; When the prince heard this, he was filled
with curiosity, to think what this might be, and the next day he
uncovered her face while she was asleep, and looked at it, and lo! it
was not Madanamanchuk&aacute;, but some one else, who, when asleep, had
lost the power of disguising her appearance by magic.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e12382src" href="#xd27e12382" name="xd27e12382src">3</a> Then
she woke up, while he was sitting by her awake. And he said to her,
&ldquo;Tell me, who are you?&rdquo; And the discreet
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; seeing him sitting up awake, and being
conscious that she was in her own shape and that her secret was
discovered, began to tell her tale saying, &ldquo;Listen, my beloved, I
will now tell you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is in the city of the Vidy&aacute;dharas a mountain of
the name of &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;hapura. There dwells a chief of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named M&aacute;nasavega, a prince puffed up
with the might of his arm, the son of king Vegavat. I am his younger
sister, and my name is Vegavat&iacute;. And that brother of mine hated
me so much that he was not willing to bestow on me the sciences. Then I
obtained them, though with difficulty, from my father, who had retired
to a wood of ascetics, and, thanks to his favour, I possess them of
greater power than any other of our race. I myself saw the wretched
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, in the palace of mount
&Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;ha, in a garden, surrounded by sentinels, I
mean your beloved, whom my brother has carried off by magic, as
R&aacute;va&#7751;a carried off the afflicted S&iacute;t&aacute;, the
wife of R&aacute;mabhadra. And as the virtuous lady repels his
caresses, he cannot subdue her to his will, for a curse has been laid
upon him, that will bring about his death, if he uses violence to any
woman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=

<p>&ldquo;So that wicked brother of mine made use of me, to try and
talk her over; and I went to that lady, who could do nothing but talk
of you. And in my conversation with her, that virtuous lady mentioned
your name,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12390src" href="#xd27e12390"
name="xd27e12390src">4</a> which was like a command from the god of
Love, and thus my mind then became fixed upon you alone. And then I
remembered an announcement which P&aacute;rvat&iacute; made to me in a
dream, much to the following effect, &lsquo;You shall be married to
that man the mere hearing of whose name overpowers you with
love.&rsquo; When I had called this to mind, I cheered up
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, and came here in her form, and married myself to
you by an artifice. So come, my beloved, I am filled with such
compassion for your wife Madanamanchuk&aacute; that I will take you
where she is; for I am the devoted servant of my rival, even as I am of
you, because you love her. For I am so completely enslaved by love for
you, that I am rendered quite unselfish by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Vegavat&iacute; had said this, she took Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
and by the might of her science flew up with him into the sky during
the night. And next morning, while she was slowly travelling through
the heaven, the attendants of the husband and wife were bewildered by
their disappearance. And when the king of Vatsa came to hear of it, he
was immediately, as it were, struck by a thunderbolt, and so were
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; and the rest. And
the citizens, and the king&rsquo;s ministers
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and the others, together with their sons
Marubh&uacute;ti and the rest, were altogether distracted.</p>
<p>Then the hermit N&aacute;rada, surrounded with a circle of light,
descended there from heaven, like a second sun. The king of Vatsa
offered him the <i>arghya</i>, and the hermit said to him, &ldquo;Your
son has been carried off by a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; to her country,
but he will soon return; and I have been sent by &#346;iva to cheer you
up.&rdquo; And after this prelude he went on to tell the king of
Vegavat&iacute;&rsquo;s proceedings, exactly as they took place; then
the king recovered his spirits and the hermit disappeared.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Vegavat&iacute; carried Narav&aacute;hanadatta
through the air to the mountain &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;hapura. And
M&aacute;nasavega, hearing of it, hastened there to kill them both.
Then Vegavat&iacute; engaged with her brother in a struggle which was
remarkable for a great display of magic power; for a woman values her
lover as her life, and much more than her own relations. Then she
assumed by the might of her magic a terrible form of Bhairava, and at
once striking M&aacute;nasavega senseless, she placed him on the
mountain of Agni.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12412src" href=
"#xd27e12412" name="xd27e12412src">5</a> And she took
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, whom at the beginning of the <span class=

her sciences,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12417src" href="#xd27e12417"
name="xd27e12417src">6</a> and placed him in a dry well in the city of
the Gandharvas, to keep him. And when he was there, she said to him,
&ldquo;Remain here a little while, my husband; good fortune will befall
you here; and do not despond in your heart, O man appointed to a happy
lot, for the sovereignty over all the Vidy&aacute;dharas is to be
yours. But I must leave this for the present, to appease my sciences,
impaired by my resistance to my elder brother; however, I will return
to you soon.&rdquo; When the Vidhy&aacute;dhar&iacute; Vegavat&iacute;
had said this, she departed somewhere or other.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then a certain Gandharva, of the name of
V&iacute;n&aacute;datta, saw Narav&aacute;hanadatta in that well. Truly
if there were not great souls in this world, born for the benefit of
others, relieving distress as wayside trees heat, the world would be a
withered forest. Thus the good Gandharva, as soon as he saw
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, asked him his name and lineage, and supporting
him with his hand, drew him out of that well, and said to him,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12428src" href="#xd27e12428" name=
"xd27e12428src">1</a> &ldquo;If you are a man and not a god, how did
you reach this city of the Gandharvas inaccessible to man? Tell
me!&rdquo; Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta answered him, &ldquo;A
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; brought me here, and threw me into the well by
her power.&rdquo; Then the good Gandharva V&iacute;n&aacute;datta,
seeing that he had the veritable signs of an emperor, took him to his
own dwelling, and waited upon him with all the luxuries at his command.
And the next day, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, perceiving that the
inhabitants of the city carried lyres in their hands, said to his host,
&ldquo;Why have all these people, even down to the children, got lyres
in their hands?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12434src" href=
"#xd27e12434" name="xd27e12434src">2</a></p>
<p>Then V&iacute;n&aacute;datta gave him this answer,
&ldquo;S&aacute;garadatta the king of the Gandharvas, who lives here,
has a daughter named Gandharvadatt&aacute;, who eclipses the nymphs of
heaven; it seems as if the Creator had blended nectar, the moon, and
sandalwood, and other choice things, in order to compose her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>body, as a specimen of his skill in making all
that is fair. She is always singing to the lyre the hymn of
Vish&#7751;u, which the god himself bestowed on her, and so she has
attained supreme skill in music.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12444src"
href="#xd27e12444" name="xd27e12444src">3</a> And the princess has
firmly resolved that whoever is so well skilled in music, that he can
play on the lyre, and sing perfectly in three scales a song in praise
of Vish&#7751;u, shall be her husband. The consequence is, that all
here are trying to learn to play the lyre, but they have not acquired
the amount of skill demanded by the princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta was delighted at hearing this speech
from the mouth of V&iacute;n&aacute;datta and he said to him,
&ldquo;All the accomplishments have chosen me for a husband, and I know
all the music, that there is in the three worlds.&rdquo; When he said
this, his friend V&iacute;n&aacute;datta conducted him into the
presence of king S&aacute;garadatta, and said there, &ldquo;Here is
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, who has fallen
into your city from the hand of a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;. He is an
adept in music, and he knows the song in praise of Vish&#7751;u, in
which the princess Gandharvadatt&aacute; takes so much pleasure.&rdquo;
When the king heard this, he said, &ldquo;It is true; I heard so much
before from the Gandharvas; so I must to-day receive him with respect
here. And he is an emanation of a divinity; he is not out of place in
the abode of gods; otherwise, if he were a man, how could he have come
here by associating with a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;? So summon
Gandharvadatt&aacute; quickly and let us test him.&rdquo; When the king
said this, the chamberlains went to fetch her.</p>
<p>And the fair one came there, all glorious with flower-ornaments,
agitating with her beauty, as if with a wind, the creepers of spring.
She sat down at her father&rsquo;s side, and the servants told her what
had taken place, and immediately, at his command, she sang a song to
the lyre. When she was joining the notes to the quarter-tones, like
Sarasvat&iacute; the wife of Brahm&aacute;, Narav&aacute;hanadatta was
astonished at her singing and her beauty. Then he said to her,
&ldquo;Princess, your lyre does not seem to me to sound well, I think
there must be a hair on the string.&rdquo; Thereupon the lyre was
examined, and they found the hair where he said, and that astonished
even the Gandharvas. Then the king took the lyre from his
daughter&rsquo;s hand, and gave it to him, saying, &ldquo;Prince, take
this, and pour nectar into our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432"
href="#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>ears.&rdquo; Then he played
on it, and sang the hymn of Vish&#7751;u with such skill that the
Gandharvas there became motionless as painted pictures.</p>
<p>Then Gandharvadatt&aacute; herself threw on him a look tender with
affection, as it were a garland of full-blown blue lotuses,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12483src" href="#xd27e12483" name=
"xd27e12483src">4</a> and therewith chose him as her husband. When the
king saw it, and called to mind his promise of that import, he at once
gave him his daughter Gandharvadatt&aacute; in marriage. As for the
wedding that thereupon took place, gladdened by the drums of the gods
and other festal signs, to what could we compare it, as it served as
the standard by which to estimate all similar rejoicings? Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta lived there with his new bride
Gandharvadatt&aacute; in heavenly bliss.</p>
<p>And one day he went out to behold the beauty of the city, and after
he had seen all kinds of places, he entered the park attached to it.
There he saw a heavenly female descending from the sky with her
daughter, like the lightning with the rain in a cloudless atmosphere.
And she was saying to her daughter, as she descended, recognising him
by her knowledge, &ldquo;This, my daughter, is your future husband, the
son of the king of Vatsa.&rdquo; &ldquo;When he saw her alight and come
towards him, he said to her, &ldquo;Who are you, and why have you
come?&rdquo; And the heavenly female said to him, thus introducing the
object of her desire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, I am Dhanavat&iacute;, the wife of a chief of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Sinha, and this is my unmarried daughter, the
sister of Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and her name is
Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;. You were announced as her future husband by a
voice that came from heaven. Then, learning by my magic science, that
you, the future emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, had been deposited
here by Vegavat&iacute;, I came to tell you my desire. You ought not to
remain in such a place as this which is accessible to the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, for they might slay you out of enmity, as you are
alone, and have not obtained your position of emperor. So come, let us
now take you to a land which is inaccessible to them. Does not the moon
delay to shine, when the circle of the sun is eclipsed? And when the
auspicious day arrives you shall marry this daughter of mine.&rdquo;
When she had said this, she took him and flew up into the air with him,
and her daughter accompanied them. And she took him to the city of
&#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;, and deposited him in a garden, and then
she disappeared with her daughter Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;.</p>
<p>There king Prasenajit, who had returned from a distant hunting
expedition, saw that prince of noble form and feature. The king
approached him full of curiosity, and asked him his name and lineage,
and then, being much delighted, courteously conducted him to his
palace. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>full of troops of elephants, adorned with lines
of horses, and looked like a pavilion for the Fortune of empire to rest
in, when wearied with her wanderings. Wherever a man born to prosperity
may be, felicities eagerly approach him, as women do their beloved one.
This accounts for the fact that the king, being an admirer of
excellence, gave Narav&aacute;hanadatta his own daughter, named
Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as. And the prince lived happily there with
her in great luxury, as if with Good Fortune created by the Disposer in
flesh and blood for his delectation.</p>
<p>One evening, when the lover of the night had arisen, raining joy
into the eyes of men, looking like the full-orbed face<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12496src" href="#xd27e12496" name=
"xd27e12496src">5</a> of the nymph of the eastern quarter, or rather
the countenance of Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as charming as nectar,
reflected in the pure mirror of the cloudless heaven, he drank wine
with that fair one at her request on the top of a palace silvered over
with the elixir of moonlight. He quaffed the liquor which was adorned
with the reflection of his beloved&rsquo;s face, and so gave pleasure
to his eyes as well as to his palate. And then he considered the moon
as far inferior in beauty to his charmer&rsquo;s face, for it wanted
the intoxicating<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12508src" href=
"#xd27e12508" name="xd27e12508src">6</a> play of the eyes and eyebrows.
And after his drinking-bout was over he went inside the house, and
retired to his couch with Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as.</p>
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta awoke from sleep, while his beloved was
still sleeping, and suddenly calling to mind his home, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Through love for Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as I have, so to
speak, forgotten my other wives; how can that have happened? But in
this too Fate is all-powerful. Far away too are my ministers. Of them
Marubh&uacute;ti takes pleasure in nought but feats of prowess, and
Hari&#347;ikba is exclusively devoted to policy; of those two I do not
now feel the need, but it grieves me that the dexterous Gomukha, who
has been my friend in all emergencies, is far away from me.&rdquo;
While he was thus lamenting, he suddenly heard the words &ldquo;Ah! how
sad!&rdquo; uttered in a low soft tone, like that of a woman, and they
at once banished sleep. When he heard them, he got up, and lighted a
candle, and looked about, and he saw in the window a lovely female
face. It seemed as if the Disposer had determined out of playfulness to
show him a second but spotless moon not in the sky, as he had that
night seen the spot-beflecked moon of heaven. And not being able to
discern the rest of her body, but eager to behold it, his eyes being
attracted by her beauty, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href=
"#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>immediately said to himself,
&ldquo;Long ago, when the Daitya &Aacute;t&aacute;pin was impeding the
creation of Brahm&aacute;, that god employed the artifice of sending
him to Nandana, saying to him, &lsquo;Go there and see a very curious
sight;&rsquo; and when he got there, he saw only the foot of a woman,
which was of wonderful beauty; and so he died from an insane desire to
see the rest of her body.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12524src" href=
"#xd27e12524" name="xd27e12524src">7</a> In the same way it may be that
the Disposer has produced this lady&rsquo;s face only to bring about my
destruction.&rdquo; While he was making this momentary surmise, the
lady displayed her shoot-like finger at the window, and beckoned to him
to come towards her.</p>
<p>Then he deliberately went out of the chamber in which his beloved
was sleeping, and with eager impatience approached that heavenly lady:
and when he came near, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Madanamanchuk&aacute;,
they say that your husband is in love with another woman: alas! you are
undone.&rdquo; When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this, he called to
mind his beloved, and the fire of separation flamed up in his bosom,
and he said to that fair one, &ldquo;Who are you? Where did you see my
beloved <span class="corr" id="xd27e12533" title=
"Source: Manadamanchuk&aacute;">Madanamanchuk&aacute;</span>? And why
have you come to me? Tell me!&rdquo; Then the bold lady took the prince
away to a distance in the night, and saying to him, &ldquo;Hear the
whole story,&rdquo; she thus began to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is in the city of <span class="corr" id="xd27e12538"
title=
"Source: Puskhar&aacute;vat&iacute;">Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute;</span>
a prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra,
who has become yellow with continually adoring the fire. Know that I am
his unmarried daughter, named Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, for he obtained
me by the special favour of the god of fire, who was pleased with his
adoration. I went to the city of Ash&aacute;&#7693;bapura to visit my
friend Vegavat&iacute;, and I did not find her there, as she had gone
somewhere to perform asceticism. But hearing from her mother
P&#7771;ithiv&iacute;dev&iacute; that your beloved
Madanamanchuk&aacute; was there, I went to her. I beheld her emaciated
with fasting, pale and squalid, with only one lock, weeping, talking
only of your virtues, surrounded by tearful bands of Vidy&aacute;dhara
princesses, who were divided between grief produced by seeing her, and
joy produced by hearing of you. She told me what you were like, and I
comforted her by promising to bring you, for my mind was overpowered by
pity for her, and attracted by your excellences. And finding out by
means of my magic skill that you were here at present, I came to you,
to inserve her interests and my own also. But when I found that you had
forgotten your first love and were talking here of other persons, I
bewailed the lot of that wife of yours, and exclaimed &lsquo;Ah! how
sad!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince had been thus addressed by her, he became impatient
and said, &ldquo;Take me where she is, and impose on me whatever
command <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>you think fit.&rdquo; When the
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; heard that, she flew
up into the air with him, and proceeded to journey on through the
moonlit night. And as she was going along, she saw a fire burning in a
certain place, so she took Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s hand, and
moved round it, keeping it on the right. In this way the bold lady
managed by an artifice to go through the ceremony of marriage with
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, for all the actions of heavenly beings have
some important end in view.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12545src" href=
"#xd27e12545" name="xd27e12545src">8</a> Then she pointed out to her
beloved from the sky the earth looking like a sacrificial platform, the
rivers like snakes, the mountains like ant-hills, and many other
wonders did she show him from time to time, until at last she had
gradually accomplished a long distance.</p>
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta became thirsty with his long journey
through the air, and begged for water; so she descended to earth from
her airy path. And she took him to the corner of a forest, and placed
him near a lake, which seemed to be full of molten silver, as its water
was white with the rays of the moon. So his craving for water was
satisfied by the draught which he drank in that beautiful forest, but
there arose in him a fresh craving as he felt a desire to embrace that
lovely lady.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12550src" href="#xd27e12550"
name="xd27e12550src">9</a> But she, when pressed, would hardly consent;
for her thoughts reverted with pity to Madanamanchuk&aacute;, whom she
had tried to comfort; in truth the noble-minded, when they have
undertaken to forward the interests of others, put out of sight their
own. And she said to him<span class="corr" title=

<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of the child that died of a broken heart because
his mother forgot to bring him a sweetmeat.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time, there lived in the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a certain widow who had one child; she was
young, and beautiful, but poor. And she was in the habit of making love
to a strange man for her gratification, and at night she used to leave
her house and roam where she pleased. But, before she went, she used
invariably to console her infant son by saying to him, &ldquo;My boy, I
will bring you a sweetmeat to-morrow morning,&rdquo; and every day she
brought him one. And the child used to remain quiet at home, buoyed up
by the hope of that sweetmeat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436"
href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>But one day she forgot, and did not bring him the sweetmeat. And
when the child asked for the sweetmeat, she said to him,
&ldquo;Sweetmeat indeed! I know of no sweet, but my sweetheart.&rdquo;
Then the child said to himself, &ldquo;She has not brought me a
sweetmeat, because she loves another better than me.&rdquo; So he lost
all hope, and his heart broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if I were over-eager to appropriate you whom I have long
loved, and if Madanamanchuk&aacute;, whom I consoled with the hope of a
joyful reunion with you, were to hear of it, and lose all hope through
me, her heart, which is as soft as a flower, would break.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12588src" href="#xd27e12588" name=
"xd27e12588src">10</a> It is this desire to spare her feelings, which
prevents me from being so eager now for your society, before I have
consoled her, though you are my beloved, dearer to me than
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; said this to Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
he was full of joy and astonishment, and he said to himself,
&ldquo;Well! Fate seems to take a pleasure in perpetually creating new
marvels, since it has produced Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, whose conduct
is so inconceivably noble.&rdquo; With these thoughts in his mind, the
prince lovingly praised her, and said, &ldquo;Then take me where that
Madanamanchuk&aacute; is.&rdquo; When Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; heard
that, she took him up, and in a moment carried him through the air to
the mountain &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;hapura. There she bestowed him on
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, whose body had long been drying up with grief,
as a shower bestows fullness on a river.</p>
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta beheld that fair one there, afflicted
with separation, thin and pale, like a digit of the new moon. That
reunion of those two seemed to restore them to life, and gave joy to
the world, like the union of the night and the moon. And the pair
embraced, scorched with the fire of separation, and as they were
streaming with fatigue, they seemed to melt into one. Then they both
partook at their ease of luxuries suddenly provided in the night by the
might of Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s science. And thanks to her
science, no one there but Madanamanchuk&aacute;, saw
Narav&aacute;hanadatta.</p>
<p>The next morning Narav&aacute;hanadatta proceeded to loose
Madanamanchuk&aacute;&rsquo;s one lock,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12603src" href="#xd27e12603" name="xd27e12603src">11</a> but she,
overpowered with resentment against her enemy, said to her beloved,
&ldquo;Long ago I made this vow, &lsquo;That lock of mine must be
loosed by my husband, when M&aacute;nasavega is slain, but not till
then; and if he is not slain, I will wear it till my death, and then it
shall be loosed by the birds, or consumed with fire.&rsquo; But now you
have loosed it, while this enemy of mine is still alive; that vexes my
soul. For <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=

Agniparvata, he did not die of the fall. And you have now been made
invisible here by Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; by means of her magic power;
otherwise the followers of that enemy, who are continually moving near
you here, would see you, and would not tolerate your
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta had been thus addressed by his wife, he,
recognising the fact that the proper time for accomplishing his object
had not yet arrived, said to her by way of calming her, &ldquo;This
desire of yours shall be fulfilled; I will soon slay that enemy; but
first I must acquire the sciences; wait a little, my
beloved<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; With
speeches of this kind Narav&aacute;hanadatta consoled
Madanamanchuk&aacute;; and remained there in that city of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.</p>
<p>Then Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; disappeared herself, and, by the power
of her magic science, bestowed in some incomprehensible way on
Narav&aacute;hanadatta her own shape. And the prince lived happily
there in her shape, and without fear of discovery, enjoying pleasures
provided by her magic science. And all the people there thought,
&ldquo;This friend of Vegavat&iacute;&rsquo;s is attending on
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, partly out of regard for Vegavat&iacute;, and
partly on account of the friendly feelings which she herself entertains
for the captive princess;&rdquo; for they all supposed that
Narav&aacute;hanadatta was no other than Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, as
he was disguised in her shape: and this was the report that they
carried to M&aacute;nasavega. Then, one day, something caused
Madanamanchuk&aacute; to relate to Narav&aacute;hanadatta her
adventures in the following words,</p>

<h3 class="main">Madanamanchuk&aacute;&rsquo;s account of her treatment
while in captivity.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When M&aacute;nasavega first brought me here, he tried
to win me to his will by his magic power, endeavouring to alarm me by
cruel actions. And then &#346;iva appeared in a terrible form, with
drawn sword and lolling tongue, and making an appalling roar, said to
M&aacute;nasavega; &ldquo;How is it that, while I still exist, thou
dost presume to treat disrespectfully the wife of him who is destined
to be emperor over all the Vidy&aacute;dhara kings?&rdquo; When the
villain M&aacute;nasavega had been thus addressed by &#346;iva, he fell
on the earth vomiting blood from his mouth. Then the god disappeared,
and that villain immediately recovered, and went to his own palace, and
again began to practise cruelties against me.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12623src" href="#xd27e12623" name="xd27e12623src">12</a></p>
<p>Then in my terror, and in the agony of separation, I was thinking of
abandoning my life, but the attendants of the harem came to me, and
said to me by way of consolation, &ldquo;Long ago this
M&aacute;nasavega beheld a certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438"
href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>beautiful hermit maiden and
tried to carry her off by force but was thus cursed by her relations;
&lsquo;When, villain, you approach another&rsquo;s wife against her
will, your head shall split into a thousand fragments;&rsquo; so he
will never force himself on the wife of another, do not be afraid.
Moreover you will soon be reunited with your husband, as the god
announced.&rdquo; Soon after the maids had said this to me,
Vegavat&iacute;, the sister of that M&aacute;nasavega, came to me to
talk me over; but when she saw me, she was filled with compassion, and
she comforted me by promising to bring you; and you already know how
she found you.</p>
<p>Then P&#7771;ithiv&iacute;dev&iacute;, the good mother of that
wicked M&aacute;nasavega, came to me, looking, with her garments white
as moonlight, like the orb of Luna without a spot, seeming to bathe me
with nectar by her charming appearance; and with a loving manner she
said to me, &ldquo;Why do you refuse food and so injure your bodily
health, though you are destined to great prosperity? And do not say to
yourself, &lsquo;How can I eat an enemy&rsquo;s food?&rsquo; For my
daughter Vegavat&iacute; has a share in this kingdom, bestowed on her
by her father, and she is your friend, for your husband has married
her. Accordingly her wealth, as belonging to your husband, is yours as
much as hers. So enjoy it. What I tell you is true, for I have
discovered it by my magic knowledge.&rdquo; This she said, and
confirmed it with an oath, and then, being attached to me, on account
of her daughter&rsquo;s connexion, she fed me with food suited to my
condition. Then Vegavat&iacute; came here with you, and conquered her
brother, and saved you; the sequel I do not know.</p>
<p>So I, remembering the magic skill of Vegavat&iacute; and the
announcement of the god, did not surrender my life, which was supported
by the hope of regaining you, and, thanks to the power of the noble
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, I have regained you, although I am thus beset
by my enemies. But my only anxiety is as to what would happen to us, if
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; here were deprived of her power, and you were
so to lose her shape, which she has bestowed on you by way of
disguise.</p>
<p>This and other such things did Madanamanchuk&aacute; say, while the
brave Narav&aacute;hanadatta remained there with her, endeavouring to
console her. But one night Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; went to her
father&rsquo;s palace, and in the morning Narav&aacute;hanadatta, owing
to her being at a distance, lost her shape, which she had bestowed on
him. And next day the attendants beheld him there in male form, and
they all ran bewildered and alarmed to the king&rsquo;s court and said,
&ldquo;Here is an adulterer crept in;&rdquo; thrusting aside the
terrified Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who tried to stop them.</p>
<p>Then king M&aacute;nasavega came there at full speed, accompanied by
his army, and surrounded him. Then the king&rsquo;s mother
P&#7771;ithiv&iacute;dev&iacute; hurried thither and said to him,
&ldquo;It will not do for you or me either to put this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>man
to death. For he is no adulterer, but Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son
of the king of Vatsa, who has come here to visit his own wife. I know
this by my magic power; why are you so blinded with wrath that you
cannot see it? Moreover I am bound to honour him, as he is my
son-in-law, and sprung from the race of the moon.&rdquo; When
M&aacute;nasavega&rsquo;s mother said this to him, he flew into a
passion, and said, &ldquo;Then he is my enemy.&rdquo; Then his mother,
out of love for her son-in-law, used another argument with him. She
said, &ldquo;My son, you will not be allowed to act wrongfully in the
world of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. For here there exists a court of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas to protect the right. So accuse him before the
president of that court<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12652src" href=
"#xd27e12652" name="xd27e12652src">13</a>. Whatever steps you take with
regard to your captive in accordance with the court&rsquo;s decision
will be commendable; but if you act otherwise, the Vidy&aacute;dharas
will be displeased, and the gods will not tolerate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&aacute;nasavega, out of respect for his mother, consented to
follow her advice, and attempted to have Narav&aacute;hanadatta bound,
with the intention of taking him before the court. But he, unable to
endure the indignity of being bound, tore a pillar from the arched
gateway, and killed with it a great number of his captor&rsquo;s
servants. And the hero, whose valour was godlike, snatched a sword from
one of those that he had killed, and at once slew with it some more of
his opponents. Then M&aacute;nasavega fettered him by his superhuman
powers, and took him, with his wife, before the court. Then the
Vidy&aacute;dharas assembled there from all quarters, summoned by the
loud sound of a drum, even as the gods assemble in Sudharm&aacute;.</p>
<p>And the president of the court, king V&aacute;yupatha, came there,
and sat down on a jewelled throne surrounded by Vidy&aacute;dharas, and
fanned by chowries which waved to and fro, as if to winnow away all
injustice. And the wicked M&aacute;nasavega stood in front of him, and
said as follows, &ldquo;This enemy of mine, who though a mortal, has
violated my harem, and seduced my sister, ought immediately to be put
to death; especially as he actually wishes to be our sovereign.&rdquo;
When the president heard this, he called on Narav&aacute;hanadatta for
an answer, and the hero said in a confident tone, &ldquo;That is a
court, where there is a president; he is a president, who says what is
just; that is just, in which there is truth; that is truth in which
there is no deceit. Here I am bound by magic, and on the floor, but my
adversary here is on a seat, and free; what fair controversy can there
be between us?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href=
"#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span></p>
<p>When V&aacute;yupatha heard this, he made M&aacute;nasavega also sit
upon the floor, as was just, and had Narav&aacute;hanadatta set free
from his bonds. Then before V&aacute;yupatha, and in the hearing of
all, Narav&aacute;hanadatta made the following reply to the accusations
of M&aacute;nasavega; &ldquo;Pray, whose harem have I violated by
coming to visit my own wife, Madanamanchuk&aacute; here, who has been
carried off by this fellow? And if his sister came and tricked me into
marrying her by assuming my wife&rsquo;s form, what fault have I
committed in this? As for my desiring empire, is there any one that
does not desire all sorts of things?&rdquo; When king V&aacute;yupatha
heard this, he reflected a little, and said, &ldquo;This noble fellow
says what is quite just; take care, my good M&aacute;nasavega, that you
do not act unjustly towards one, whom great exaltation
awaits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though V&aacute;yupatha said this, M&aacute;nasavega, blinded with
delusion, refused to turn from his wicked way; and then
V&aacute;yupatha flew into a passion. Then, out of regard for justice,
he engaged in a contest with M&aacute;nasavega, in which fully equipped
armies were employed on both sides. For resolute men, when they sit on
the seat of justice, keep only the right in view, and look upon the
mighty as weak, and one of their own race as an alien.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12689src" href="#xd27e12689" name=
"xd27e12689src">14</a> And then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, looking towards
the nymphs of heaven, who were gazing at the scene with intense
interest, said to M&aacute;nasavega, &ldquo;Lay aside your magic
disguises, and fight with me in visible shape, in order that I may give
you a specimen of my prowess by slaying you with one blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly those Vidy&aacute;dharas there remained quarrelling
among themselves, when suddenly a splendid pillar in the court cleft
asunder in the middle with a loud noise,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12704src" href="#xd27e12704" name="xd27e12704src">15</a> and
&#346;iva issued from it in his terrific form. He filled the whole sky,
in colour like antimony; he hid the sun; the gleams of his fiery eyes
flickered like flashes of lightning; his shining teeth were like cranes
flying in a long row; and so he was terrible like a roaring cloud of
the great day of doom. The great god exclaimed &ldquo;Villain, this
future emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas shall not be insulted,&rdquo;
and with these words he dismissed M&aacute;nasavega with face cast
down, and encouraged V&aacute;yupatha. And then the adorable one took
Narav&aacute;hanadatta up in his arms, and in order to preserve his
life, carried him in this way to the beautiful and happy mountain
&#7770;ishyam&uacute;ka, and after setting him down there, disappeared.
And then the quarrel among the Vidy&aacute;dharas in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>that
court came to an end, and V&aacute;yupatha went home again accompanied
by the other Vidy&aacute;dharas his friends. But M&aacute;nasavega,
making Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who was distracted with joy and grief,
precede him, went despondent to &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;hapura his own
dwelling.</p>

<p class="first">I think, a hero&rsquo;s prosperity must be unequal;
Fate again and again severely tests firmness by the ordeals of
happiness and misery: this explains why the fickle goddess kept uniting
Narav&aacute;hanadatta to wife after wife, when he was alone in those
remote regions, and then separated him from them.</p>
<p>Then, while he was residing on the mountain &#7770;ishyam&uacute;ka,
his beloved Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; came up to him, and said,
&ldquo;It was owing to the misfortune of my not being present that
M&aacute;nasavega carried you off on that occasion to the court, with
the intention of doing you an injury. When I heard of it, I at once
went there, and by means of my magic power I produced the delusion of
an appearance of the god, and brought you here. For, though the
Vidy&aacute;dharas are mighty, their influence does not extend over
this mountain, for this is the domain of the Siddhas.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e12731src" href="#xd27e12731" name="xd27e12731src">1</a> Indeed
even my science is of no avail here for that reason, and that grieves
me, for how will you subsist on the products of the forest as your only
food?&rdquo; When she had said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta remained
with her there, longing for the time of deliverance, thinking on
Madanamanchuk&aacute;. And on the banks of the sanctifying
Pamp&aacute;-lake near that mountain, he ate fruits and roots of
heavenly flavour, and he drank the holy water of the lake which was
rendered delicious and fragrant by the fruits dropped from trees on its
bank, as a relish to his meal of deer&rsquo;s flesh.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e12734src" href="#xd27e12734" name="xd27e12734src">2</a> And he
lived at the foot of trees and in the interior of caverns, and so he
imitated the conduct of R&aacute;ma who once lived in the forests of
that region. And Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, beholding there various
hermitages once occupied by R&aacute;ma, told him the story of
R&aacute;ma for his amusement. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442"

<h3 class="main">Story of R&aacute;ma.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this forest R&aacute;ma once dwelt accompanied by
Lakshma&#7751;a, and waited on by S&iacute;t&aacute;, in the society of
hermits, making to himself a hut at the foot of a tree. And
S&iacute;t&aacute;, perfuming the whole forest with the perfume given
her by Anas&uacute;y&aacute;, remained here in the midst of the
hermits&rsquo; wives, wearing a robe of bark.</p>
<p>Here the Daitya Dundubhi was slain in a cave by B&aacute;li, which
was the original cause of the enmity between B&aacute;li and
Sugr&iacute;va. For Sugr&iacute;va, wrongly supposing that the Daitya
had slain B&aacute;li, blocked up the entrance of the cave with
mountains, and went away terrified. But B&aacute;li broke through the
obstruction, and came out, and banished Sugr&iacute;va, saying,
&ldquo;This fellow imprisoned me in the cave because he wanted to get
my kingdom.&rdquo; But Sugr&iacute;va fled, and came and established
himself on this plateau of &#7770;ishyam&uacute;ka with the lords of
the monkeys, of whom Hanum&aacute;n was the chief.</p>
<p>Then R&aacute;va&#7751;a came here, and beguiling the soul of
R&aacute;ma with the phantom of a golden deer, he carried off his wife
the daughter of Janaka. Then the descendant of Raghu, who longed for
news of S&iacute;t&aacute;, made an alliance with Sugr&iacute;va, who
desired the slaughter of B&aacute;li. And in order to let his might be
known, he cleft seven palm-trees here with an arrow, while the mighty
B&aacute;li with great difficulty cleft one of them. And then the hero
went hence to Kishkindhya, and after slaying B&aacute;li with a single
arrow, which he launched as if in sport, gave his kingdom to
Sugr&iacute;va.</p>
<p>Then the followers of Sugr&iacute;va, headed by Hanum&aacute;n, went
hence in every direction to gain information about S&iacute;t&aacute;.
And R&aacute;ma remained here during the rainy season with the roaring
clouds, which seemed to share his grief shedding showery tear-drops. At
last Hanum&aacute;n crossed the sea at the suggestion of
Samp&aacute;ti, and by great exertions obtained for R&aacute;ma the
required information; whereupon he marched with the monkeys, and threw
a bridge over the sea, and killed his enemy the lord of Lank&aacute;,
and brought back queen S&iacute;t&aacute; in the flying chariot,
passing over this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my husband, you also shall attain good fortune: successes
come of their own accord to heroes who remain resolute in
misfortunes.&rdquo; This and other such tales did
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; tell, while she roamed about here and there
for her pleasure with Narav&aacute;hanadatta.</p>
<p>And one day, as he was in the neighbourhood of Pamp&aacute;, two
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;s, Dhanavat&iacute; and
Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;, descended from heaven and approached him.
These were the two ladies who carried him from the city of the
Gandharvas to the city of &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;, where
he<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12760src" href="#xd27e12760" name=
"xd27e12760src">3</a> married Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span>And
while Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute; was conversing with
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; as an old friend, Dhanavat&iacute; thus
addressed <span class="corr" id="xd27e12771" title=
"Source: Narav&aacute;hahanadatta">Narav&aacute;hanadatta</span>,
&ldquo;I long ago bestowed on you this daughter of mine
Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;, as far as promises could do it; so marry her;
for the day of your exaltation is nigh at hand.&rdquo;
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, out of love for her friend, and
Narav&aacute;hanadatta both agreed to this proposal. Then
Dhanavat&iacute; bestowed that daughter of hers Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;
on that son of the king of Vatsa, with appropriate ceremonies. And she
celebrated the great feast of her daughter&rsquo;s wedding in such
style that the glorious and heavenly preparations she had accumulated
by means of her magic knowledge made it really beautiful.</p>
<p>Then the next day she said to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, &ldquo;My son,
it will never do for you to remain long in a nondescript place like
this: for the Vidy&aacute;dharas are a deceitful race, and you have no
business here. So depart now with your wife for your own city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;; and I will come there with my son
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and with the Vidy&aacute;dhara chiefs that
follow me, to ensure your success.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12776src" href="#xd27e12776" name="xd27e12776src">4</a> When
Dhanavat&iacute; had said this, she mounted up into the sky,
illuminating it, as it were, with moonlight, though it was day, by the
gleam of her white body and raiment.</p>
<p>And Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; and Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute; carried
Narav&aacute;hanadatta through the air to his city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;. When he reached the garden of the city, he
descended from heaven into his capital, and was seen by his attendants.
And there arose there a cry from the people on all sides, &ldquo;We are
indeed happy; here is the prince come back.&rdquo; Then the king of
Vatsa, hearing of it, came there quickly in high delight, as if
irrigated with a sudden shower of nectar, with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and the
prince&rsquo;s wives, Ratnaprabh&aacute; and the rest; and
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and the other ministers of the king of
Vatsa, and Kalingasen&aacute; and the prince&rsquo;s own ministers,
Gomukha and his fellows, approached him in order of precedence as
eagerly as travellers make for a lake in the hot season. And they saw
the hero, whose high birth qualified him for a lofty station, sitting
between his two wives, like <span class="corr" id="xd27e12796" title=
"Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> between
Rukmi&#7751;&iacute; and Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute;. And when they saw
him, they hid their eyes with tears of joy, as if for fear lest they
should leap out of their skins in their delight. And the king of Vatsa
and his queens embraced after a long absence that son of theirs, and
could not let him go, for they were, as it were, riveted to him by the
hairs of their bodies erect from joy.</p>
<p>Then a great feast began by beat of drum, and Vegavat&iacute;, the
daughter of Vegavat, and sister of M&aacute;nasavega, who was married
to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href=
"#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>finding it all out by the might of
her recovered science, came down to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; through
the air, and fell at the feet of her father-in-law and mother-in-law,
and prostrating herself before her husband, said to him,
&ldquo;Auspicious sir, after I had become weak by my exertions on your
behalf, I recovered my magic powers by self-mortification in a grove of
ascetics and now I have returned into your presence.&rdquo; When she
had said this, she was welcomed by her husband and the others, and she
repaired to her friends Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, and
Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;.</p>
<p>They embraced her and made her sit between them; and at that moment
Dhanavat&iacute;, the mother of Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;, also arrived;
and various kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas came with her, surrounded
by their forces, that hid the heaven like clouds; her own heroic son,
the strong-armed Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and a powerful relation of
hers, Amitagati by name, and Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra the mighty
father of Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, and V&aacute;yupatha, the president
of the court, who had previously declared himself on
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s side, and the heroic king Hemaprabha,
the father of Ratnaprabh&aacute;, accompanied by his son Vajraprabha
and followed by his army. And S&aacute;garadatta the king of the
Gandharvas came there, accompanied by his daughter
Gandharvadatt&aacute;, and by Chitr&aacute;ngada. And when they
arrived, they were becomingly honoured by the king of Vatsa and his
son, and sat in due order on thrones.</p>
<p>And immediately king Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra said to his
son-in-law Narav&aacute;hanadatta, as he was in the hall of assembly,
&ldquo;King, you have been appointed by the god<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12808src" href="#xd27e12808" name="xd27e12808src">5</a> emperor
over us all, and it is owing to our great love for you, that we have
all come to you. And queen Dhanavat&iacute; here, your mother-in-law, a
strict votary, possessing divine knowledge, wearing the rosary, and the
skin of the black antelope, like an incarnation of Durg&aacute;, or
S&aacute;vitr&iacute; having acquired magic powers, an object of
reverence to the noblest Vidy&aacute;dharas, has made herself ready to
protect you; so you are certain to prosper in your undertaking; but
listen to what I am about to say. There are two divisions of the
Vidy&aacute;dhara territory<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12814src" href=
"#xd27e12814" name="xd27e12814src">6</a> on the Him&aacute;layas here,
the northern and the southern, both extending over many peaks of that
range; the northern division is on the other side of Kail&aacute;sa,
but the southern is on this side of it. And this Amitagati here has
just performed a difficult penance on mount Kail&aacute;sa, in order to
obtain the sovereignty over the northern division, and propitiated
&#346;iva. And &#346;iva made this revelation to him,
&lsquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta thy emperor will accomplish thy
desire,&rsquo; so he has come here to you. In that division there is a
chief monarch, named Mandaradeva, who is evilly disposed, but though
mighty, he will be easy for you to conquer, when you have obtained the
sciences peculiar to the Vidy&aacute;dharas. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But the king named Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, who rules
in the midst of the southern division, is evil-minded and exceedingly
hard to conquer on account of the might of his magic science. Moreover
he is a great friend of your enemy M&aacute;nasavega. Until he is
overcome, your undertaking will not prosper; so acquire as quickly as
possible great and transcendent power of science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra had said this, Dhanavat&iacute;
spake, &ldquo;Good, my son, it is as this king tells thee. Go hence to
the land of the Siddhas<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12822src" href=
"#xd27e12822" name="xd27e12822src">7</a> and propitiate the god
&#346;iva, in order that thou mayest obtain the magic sciences, for how
can there be any excelling without his favour? And these kings will be
assembled there to protect thee.&rdquo; Then Chitr&aacute;ngada said,
&ldquo;It is even so; but I will advance in front of all; let us
conquer our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta determined to do as they had advised,
and he performed the auspicious ceremony before setting out, and bowed
at the feet of his tearful parents, and other superiors, and received
their blessing, and then ascended with his wives and ministers a
splendid palanquin provided by the skill of Amitagati, and started on
his expedition, obscuring the heaven with his forces, that resembled
the water of the sea raised by the wind at the end of a <i>kalpa</i>,
as it were proclaiming by the echoes of his army&rsquo;s roar on the
limits of the horizon, that the emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas had
come to visit them.</p>
<p>And he was rapidly conducted by the king of the Gandharvas and the
chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas and Dhanavat&iacute; to that mountain,
which was the domain of the Siddhas. There the Siddhas prescribed for
him a course of self-mortification, and he performed asceticism by
sleeping on the ground, bathing in the early morning, and eating
fruits. And the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas remained surrounding
him on every side, guarding him unweariedly day and night. And the
Vidy&aacute;dhara princesses, contemplating him eagerly while he was
performing his penance, seemed with the gleams of their eyes to clothe
him in the skin of a black antelope. Others shewed by their eyes turned
inwards out of anxiety for him, and their hands placed on their
breasts, that he had at once entered their hearts.</p>
<p>And five more noble maidens of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race, beholding
him, were inflamed with the fire of love, and made this agreement
together, &ldquo;We five friends must select this prince as our common
husband, and we must marry him at the same time, not separately; if one
of us marries him separately, the rest must enter the fire on account
of that violation of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the heavenly maidens were thus agitated at the sight of him,
suddenly great portents manifested themselves in the grove of ascetics.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>A very terrible wind blew, uprooting splendid
trees, as if to shew that even thus in that place should heroes fall in
fight; and the earth trembled as if anxious as to what all that could
mean, and the hills cleft asunder, as if to give an opening for the
terrified to escape, and the sky, rumbling awfully, though
cloudless,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12838src" href="#xd27e12838"
name="xd27e12838src">8</a> seemed to say, &ldquo;Ye Vidy&aacute;dharas,
guard, guard to the best of your power, this emperor of yours.&rdquo;
And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, in the midst of the alarm produced by these
portents, remained unmoved, meditating upon the adorable three-eyed
god; and the heroic kings of the Gandharvas and lords of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas remained guarding him, ready for battle, expecting
some calamity; and they uttered war-cries, and agitated the forest of
their lithe swords, as if to scare away the portents that announced the
approach of evil.</p>
<p>And the next day after this the army of the Vidy&aacute;dharas was
suddenly seen in the sky, dense as a cloud at the end of the
<i>kalpa</i>, uttering a terrible shout. Then Dhanavat&iacute;, calling
to mind her magic science, said, &ldquo;This is
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a come with M&aacute;nasavega.&rdquo; Then
those kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas and the Gandharvas raised their
weapons, but Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a with M&aacute;nasavega
rushed upon them exclaiming, &ldquo;What right has a mere man to rank
with beings like us? So I will to-day crush your pride, you sky-goers
that take part with him.&rdquo; When Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a said
this, Chitr&aacute;ngada rushed upon him angrily, and attacked him.</p>
<p>And king S&aacute;garadatta, the sovereign of the Gandharvas, and
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and Amitagati, and king V&aacute;yupatha, and
Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra, and all the chiefs of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, great heroes all, rushed upon the wicked
M&aacute;nasavega, roaring like lions, followed by the whole of their
forces. And right terrible was that storm of battle, thick with the
clouds of dust raised by the army, with the gleams of weapons for
flashes of lightning, and a falling rain of blood. And so
Chitr&aacute;ngada and his friends made, as it were, a great sacrifice
for the demons, which was full of blood for wine, and in which the
heads of enemies were strewn as an offering. And streams of gore flowed
away, full of bodies for alligators, and floating weapons for snakes,
and in which marrow intermingled took the place of cuttle-fish
bone.</p>
<p>Then Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, as his army was slain, and he
himself was nigh to death, called to mind the magic science of
Gaur&iacute;, which he had formerly propitiated and made well-disposed
to him; and that science appeared in visible form, with three eyes,
armed with the trident,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12853src" href=
"#xd27e12853" name="xd27e12853src">9</a> and paralysed the chief
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>heroes of Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s army.
Then Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, having regained strength, rushed
with a loud shout towards Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and fell on him to
try his strength in wrestling. And being beaten by him in wrestling,
the cogging Vidy&aacute;dhara again summoned up that science, and by
its power he seized his antagonist in his arms and flew up to the sky.
However, he was prevented by the might of Dhanavat&iacute;&rsquo;s
science from slaying the prince, so he flung him down on the mountain
of fire.</p>
<p>But M&aacute;nasavega seized his comrades Gomukha and the rest, and
flew up into the sky with them, and flung them at random in all
directions. But, after they had been flung up, they were preserved by a
science in visible shape employed by Dhanavat&iacute;, and placed in
different spots on the earth. And that science comforted those heroes,
one by one, saying to them, &ldquo;You will soon recover that master of
yours successful and flourishing,&rdquo; and having said this it
disappeared. Then Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a went back home with
M&aacute;nasavega, thinking that their side had been victorious.</p>
<p>But Dhanavat&iacute; said, &ldquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta will return
to you after he has attained his object, no harm will befall
him;&rdquo; and thereupon the lords of the Gandharvas and princes of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, Chitr&aacute;ngada and the others, flung off
their paralysing stupor, and went for the present to their own abodes.
And Dhanavat&iacute; took her daughter Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute;, with
all her fellow-wives, and went to her own home.</p>
<p>M&aacute;nasavega, for his part, went and said to
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, &ldquo;Your husband is slain; so you had better
marry me;&rdquo; but she, standing in front of him, said to him
laughing, &ldquo;He will slay you, no one can slay him, as he has been
appointed by the god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Narav&aacute;hanadatta was being hurled down by his enemy
on the mountain of fire, a certain heavenly being came there, and
received him; and after preserving his life, he took him quickly to the
cool bank of the Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;. And when
Narav&aacute;hanadatta asked him who he was, he comforted him, and said
to him, &ldquo;I, prince, am a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named
Am&#7771;itaprabha, and I have been sent by &#346;iva on the present
occasion to save your life. Here is the mountain of Kail&aacute;sa in
front of you, the dwelling-place of that god; if you propitiate
&#346;iva there, you will obtain unimpeded felicity. So, come, I will
take you there.&rdquo; When that noble Vidy&aacute;dhara had said this,
he immediately conveyed him there, and took leave of him, and
departed.</p>
<p>But Narav&aacute;hanadatta, when he had reached Kail&aacute;sa,
propitiated with asceticism Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, whom he found there in
front of him. And after obtaining his permission, he entered the
hermitage of &#346;iva, emaciated with self-mortification, and he
beheld Nandin at the door. He devoutly circumambulated him, and then
Nandin said to him, &ldquo;Thou hast well-nigh attained all thy ends;
for all the obstacles that hindered thee have now been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span>overcome; so remain here, and perform a strict
course of asceticism that will subdue sin, until thou shalt have
propitiated the adorable god; for successes depend on purity.&rdquo;
When Nandin had said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta began a severe course
of penance there, living on air and meditating on the god &#346;iva and
the goddess P&aacute;rvat&iacute;.</p>
<p>And the adorable god &#346;iva, pleased with his asceticism, granted
him a vision of himself, and accompanied by the goddess, thus spake to
the prince, as he bent before him, &ldquo;Become now emperor over all
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and let all the most transcendent sciences be
immediately revealed to thee! By my favour thou shalt become invincible
by thy enemies, and, as thou shalt be proof against cut or thrust, thou
shalt slay all thy foes. And when thou appearest, the sciences of thy
enemies shall be of no avail against thee. So go forth: even the
science of Gaur&iacute; shall be subject to thee.&rdquo; When &#346;iva
and Gaur&iacute; had bestowed these boons on Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
the god also gave him a great imperial chariot, in the form of a lotus,
made by Brahm&aacute;. Then all the sciences presented themselves to
the prince in bodily form, and expressed their desire to carry out his
orders by saying, &ldquo;What do you enjoin on us, that we may perform
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having obtained many boons,
bowed before the great god, and ascended the heavenly lotus-chariot,
after he had received permission from him to depart, and went first to
the city of Amitagati, named Vakrapura; and as he went, the sciences
shewed him the path, and the bards of the Siddhas sang his praises. And
Amitagati, seeing him from a distance, as he came along through the
air, mounted on a chariot, advanced to meet him and bowed before him,
and made him enter his palace. And when he described how he had
obtained all these magic powers, Amitagati was so delighted that he
gave him as a present his own daughter named Sulochan&aacute;. And with
her, thus obtained, like a second imperial fortune of the
Vidy&aacute;dhara race, the emperor joyfully passed that day as one
long festival.</p>

<p class="first">The next day, as the new emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta was sitting in Vakrapura, in the hall of
audience, a certain man descended from heaven, with a wand in his hand,
and came up to him, and bowing before him, said to him, &ldquo;Know, O
king, that I am Pauraruehideva the hereditary warder of the emperor of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and I am come here to tender my services to you
in that capacity.&rdquo; When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this, he
looked at the face of Amitagati; and he said, &ldquo;It is true, my
liege:&rdquo; so Narav&aacute;hanadatta gladly admitted the new-comer
to the office of warder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=
"#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Dhanavat&iacute;, finding out by her power what had occurred,
with his wives Vegavat&iacute; and the others, and her son
Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and king Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra with
V&aacute;yupatha, and Chitr&aacute;ngada with S&aacute;garadatta, and
Hemaprabha and the others came there, obscuring the sun with their
armies; as if declaring beforehand that they would endure no fire and
heat in their foes. When they arrived, they fell at the feet of that
emperor, and he honoured them with a welcome as their rank deserved,
but, out of great veneration, he himself fell at the feet of
Dhanavat&iacute;, and she, being highly pleased, loaded that son-in-law
of her&rsquo;s with blessings. And when he told the story of his
obtaining magic powers, Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and the others were
exceedingly gratified at their emperor&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>And the emperor, seeing that his wives had arrived in his presence,
said to Dhanavat&iacute;, &ldquo;Where are my ministers?&rdquo; And she
answered him, &ldquo;When they had been flung in all directions by
M&aacute;nasavega, I saved them by the help of a mighty science, and
placed them in different spots.&rdquo; Then he had them brought by a
science incarnate in bodily form; and they came and enquired after his
welfare and clung to his feet, and then he said to them, &ldquo;Why and
how and where have you spent so many days? Tell me one by one your
marvellous tale.&rdquo; Then Gomukha told his story first.</p>

<p class="first">When I was flung away by the enemy on that occasion,
some goddess bore me up in her hands, and comforted me, and placed me
in a distant forest, and disappeared. Then I was minded in my
affliction to abandon the body by hurling myself from a precipice; but
a certain ascetic came up to me and dissuaded me saying, &ldquo;Do not
act thus, Gomukha, you will again behold your master when he has gained
his object.&rdquo; Then I said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, and how do
you know that?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Come to my hermitage, and
there I will tell you.&rdquo; Then I went with that man, who by his
knowing my name had proved the greatness of his knowledge, to his
hermitage, which was called &#346;ivakshetra. There he entertained me
and told me his story in the following words:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of N&aacute;gasv&aacute;min and the
witches.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am a Br&aacute;hman named N&aacute;gasv&aacute;min,
from a city called Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina. When my father went to heaven,
I went to P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and repaired to a teacher named
Jayadatta, to acquire learning. But in spite of all the teaching that I
got, I was so stupid that I did not manage to learn a single syllable;
so all the pupils there made game of me. Then, being the victim of
contempt, I set out on a pilgrimage to the shrine of the goddess
Durg&aacute; in the Vindhya mountains; and when I had got halfway I
came across a city named Vakrolaka.</p>
<p>I went into that city to beg; and in one house the mistress gave me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>with my alms a red lotus. I took it, and went on
to another house, and there the mistress said to me, when she saw me,
&ldquo;Alas! a witch has secured possession of you. See! she has given
you a man&rsquo;s hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12902src" href=
"#xd27e12902" name="xd27e12902src">1</a> which she has passed off on
you for a red lotus.&rdquo; When I heard that, I looked myself, and lo!
it was no lotus, but a human hand. I flung it away, and fell at her
feet, and said, &ldquo;Mother, devise some expedient for me, that I may
live.&rdquo; When she heard this she said, &ldquo;Go! in a village of
the name of Karabha, three <i>yojanas</i> distant from this place,
there is a Br&aacute;hman of the name of Devarakshita. He has in his
house a splendid brown cow, an incarnation of Surabhi; she will protect
you during this night, if you repair to her for refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, I ran full of fear, and reached, at the close of
the day, the house of that Br&aacute;hman in the village of Karabha.
When I had entered, I beheld that brown cow, and I worshipped her and
said, &ldquo;Being terrified, goddess, I have come to you for
protection.&rdquo; And just then, night having set in, that witch came
there through the air with other witches, threatening me, longing for
my flesh and blood. When the brown cow saw that, she placed me between
her hoofs, and defended me, fighting against those witches all the
livelong night. In the morning they went away, and the cow said to me
with an articulate voice, &ldquo;My son, I shall not be able to protect
you the next night. So go on further; at a distance of five
<i>yojanas</i> from this place there is a mighty P&aacute;&#347;upata
ascetic named Bh&uacute;ti&#347;iva, dwelling in a temple of &#346;iva
in a forest. He possesses supernatural knowledge, and he will protect
you for this one night, if you take refuge with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I heard that, I bowed before her, and set out from that place;
and I soon reached that Bh&uacute;ti&#347;iva, and took refuge with
him. And at night those very same witches came there also in the very
same way. Then that Bh&uacute;ti&#347;iva made me enter the inner
apartment of his house,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12924src" href=
"#xd27e12924" name="xd27e12924src">2</a> and taking up a position at
the door, trident in hand, kept off the witches. Next morning,
Bh&uacute;ti&#347;iva, having conquered them, gave me food, and said to
me, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I shall not be able to protect you any
longer; but in a village named Sandhy&aacute;v&aacute;sa, at a distance
of ten <i>yojanas</i> from this place, there is a Br&aacute;hman named
Vasumati: go to him: and if you manage to get through this third night,
you will escape altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this to me, I bowed before him, and set out from that
place. But on account of the length of the journey that I had to make,
the sun set before I had reached my destination. And when night had set
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>in, the witches pursued after me and caught me.
And they seized me and went off with me through the air much pleased.
But thereupon some other witches of great power flew past them in
front. And suddenly there arose between the two parties a tumultuous
fight. And in the confusion I escaped from the hands of my captors, and
fell to the ground in a very desolate part of the country.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12937src" href="#xd27e12937" name=
"xd27e12937src">3</a></p>
<p>And there I saw a certain great palace, which seemed to say to me
with its open door, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; So I fled into it bewildered
with fear, and I beheld a lady of wonderful beauty, surrounded with a
hundred ladies-in-waiting, gleaming with brightness, like a protecting
herb<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12942src" href="#xd27e12942" name=
"xd27e12942src">4</a> that shines in the night, made by the Creator out
of pity for me. I immediately recovered my spirits and questioned her,
and she said to me, &ldquo;I am a Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; named
Sumitr&aacute;, and I am thus here owing to a curse. And in order that
my curse may come to an end, I have been directed to marry a mortal: so
marry me, as you have unexpectedly arrived here; fear not.&rdquo; When
she had said this, she quickly gave orders to her servants; and she
provided me, to my great delight, with baths and unguents, food and
drink, and garments. Strange was the contrast between the terror caused
by those witches and the happiness that immediately followed! Even fate
itself cannot comprehend the principle that makes men fall into
happiness or misery.</p>
<p>Then I remained there in happiness with that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;
during those days; but at last one day she said to me of her own
accord, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, my curse is at an end; so I must leave
this place at once. However, by my favour you shall have divine
insight; and, though an ascetic, you shall have all enjoyments at your
command, and be free from fear. But as long as you are here, do not
visit the middle block of buildings of this palace of mine.&rdquo; When
she had said this, she disappeared; and thereupon, I, out of curiosity,
went up to the middle block of buildings, and there I saw a horse. I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>went up to the horse, and he flung me from him
with a kick; and immediately I found myself in this temple of
&#346;iva.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12965src" href="#xd27e12965"
name="xd27e12965src">5</a></p>
<p>Since that time I have remained here, and I have gradually acquired
supernatural powers. Accordingly, though I am a mortal, I possess
knowledge of the three times. In the same way do all men in this world
find successes beset with difficulties. So do you remain in this place;
&#346;iva will bestow on you the success that you desire.</p>
<p>When that wise being had told me all this, I conceived hopes of
recovering you, and I remained there some days in his hermitage. And
to-day, my lord, &#346;iva in a dream informed me of your success, and
some heavenly nymph seized me up, and brought me here. This is the
history of my adventures.</p>
<p>When Gomukha had said this, he stopped, and then Marubh&uacute;ti
began to tell his tale in the presence of Narav&aacute;hanadatta.</p>

<h3 class="main">Marubh&uacute;ti&rsquo;s account of his
adventures.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When I was flung away on that occasion by
M&aacute;nasavega, some divinity took me up in her hands, and placing
me in a distant forest, disappeared. Then I wandered about afflicted
and anxious to obtain some means of committing suicide, when I saw a
certain hermitage encircled with a river. I entered it, and beheld an
ascetic with matted hair sitting on a slab of rock, and I bowed before
him and went up to him. He said to me, &ldquo;Who are you, and how did
you reach this uninhabited land?&rdquo; Thereupon, I told him my whole
story. Then he understood and said to me, &ldquo;Do not slay yourself
now! You shall learn here the truth about your master, and afterwards
you shall do what is fitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with this advice of his I remained there, eager for
tidings of you, my liege: and while I was there, some heavenly nymphs
came to bathe in the river. Then the hermit said to me, &ldquo;Go
quickly and carry off the clothes of one of those nymphs bathing
there;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12990src" href="#xd27e12990" name=
"xd27e12990src">6</a> and then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453"
href="#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span>you will learn tidings of
your master.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span>
When I heard that, I did as he advised me, and that nymph, whose
garments I had taken, followed me, with her bathing-dress dripping with
moisture,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13024src" href="#xd27e13024" name=
"xd27e13024src">7</a> and with her arms crossed in front of her
breasts.</p>
<p>That hermit said to her, &ldquo;If you tell us tidings of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, you may have back your two garments.&rdquo;
Then she said, &ldquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta is at present on mount
Kail&aacute;sa, engaged in worshipping &#346;iva, and in a few days he
will be the emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had said this, that heavenly nymph became, in virtue of a
curse, the wife of that ascetic, having made acquaintance with him by
conversing with him.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13031src" href=
"#xd27e13031" name="xd27e13031src">8</a> So the ascetic lived with that
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, and on account of her prophecy I conceived
the hope of being reunited with you and I went on living there. And in
a few days the heavenly nymph became pregnant, and brought forth a
child, and she said to the ascetic, &ldquo;My curse has been brought to
an end by living with you.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13037src" href=
"#xd27e13037" name="xd27e13037src">9</a> If you desire to see any more
of me, cook this child of mine with rice and eat it; then you will be
reunited to me<span class="corr" id="xd27e13040" title=
"Source: ?">.</span>&rdquo; When she had said this, she went away, and
that ascetic cooked her child with rice, and ate it: and then he flew
up into the air and followed her.</p>
<p>At first I was unwilling to eat of that dish, though he urged me to
do so; but seeing that eating of it bestowed supernatural powers, I
took two grains of rice from the cooking-vessel, and ate them. That
produced in me the effect that wherever I spat, gold<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13045src" href="#xd27e13045" name="xd27e13045src">10</a> was
immediately produced. Then I roamed about relieved from my poverty, and
at last I reached a town. There I lived in the house of a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i>, and, thanks to the gold I was able to produce,
indulged in the most lavish expenditure; but the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;</i>, eager to discover my secret,
treacherously gave me an emetic. That made me vomit, and in the process
the two grains of rice, that I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454"
href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>previously eaten, came out of
my mouth, looking like two glittering rubies. And no sooner had they
come out, than the <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;</i> snapped them up,
and swallowed them. So I lost my power of producing gold, of which the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;</i> thus deprived me.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, &ldquo;&#346;iva still retains his crescent and
Vish&#7751;u his <i>kaustubha</i> jewel; but I know what would be the
result, if those two deities were to fall into the clutches of a
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13077src"
href="#xd27e13077" name="xd27e13077src">11</a> But such is this world,
full of marvels, full of frauds; who can fathom it, or the sea, at any
time?&rdquo; With such sad reflections in my bosom I went despondent to
a temple of Durg&aacute;, to propitiate the goddess with asceticism, in
order to recover you. And after I had fasted for three nights, the
goddess gave me this command in a dream, &ldquo;Thy master has obtained
all he desires: go, and behold him;&rdquo; upon hearing this I woke up;
and this very morning some goddess carried me to your feet; this,
prince, is the story of my adventures.</p>
<p>When Marubh&uacute;ti had said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta and his
courtiers laughed at him for having been tricked by a
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;</i>.</p>

<h3 class="main">Hari&#347;ikha&rsquo;s account of his adventures.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then Hari&#347;ikha said;&mdash;On that occasion when
I was seized by my enemy, some divinity saved me and deposited me in
Ujjayin&iacute;. There I was so unhappy that I conceived the design of
abandoning the body; so at nightfall I went into the cemetery and
proceeded to construct a pyre with the logs there. I lighted it and
began to worship the fire, and while I was thus engaged, a prince of
the demons, named T&aacute;lajangha, came up to me, and said to me,
&ldquo;Why do you enter the fire? Your master is alive, and you shall
be united with him, now that he has obtained the supernatural powers he
desired.&rdquo; With these words, the demon, though naturally cruel,
lovingly dissuaded me from death; even some stones melt when fate is
propitious. Then I went and remained for a long time performing
asceticism in front of the god; and some divinity has to-day brought me
to your side, my liege.</p>
<p>Thus Hari&#347;ikha told his tale, and the others in their turn told
theirs, and then, at the suggestion of Amitagati, king
Narav&aacute;hanadatta incited the venerable Dhanavat&iacute;, adored
by the Vidy&aacute;dharas, to bestow all the sciences on those
ministers of his also. Then all his ministers also became
Vidy&aacute;dharas; and Dhanavat&iacute; said, &ldquo;Now conquer your
enemies;&rdquo; so on a fortunate day the hero gave orders that the
imperial troops should march out towards the city of
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, called Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the army of the Vidy&aacute;dharas mounted up into the sky,
obscuring the sun, looking like a rising of R&aacute;hu out of due time
chilling to the foe. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta himself ascended the
pericarp of the lotus-chariot, and placed his wives on the filaments,
and his friends on the leaves, and preceded by Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha
and the others, set out through the air to conquer his enemies. And
when he had completed half his journey, he came to the palace of
Dhanavat&iacute; which was called M&aacute;tangapura, and he stayed
there that day, and she did the honours of the house to him. And while
he was there, he sent an ambassador to challenge to the combat the
Vidy&aacute;dhara princes Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and
M&aacute;nasavega.</p>
<p>The next day he deposited his wives in M&aacute;tangapura, and went
with the Vidy&aacute;dhara kings to Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a. There
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and M&aacute;nasavega came out to fight
with them, and Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and his colleagues met them face
to face. When the battle began, brave warriors fell like trees marked
out for the axe, and torrents of blood flowed on the mountain
Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a. The combat, eager to devour the lives of
heroes, yawned like a demon of destruction, with tongues in the form of
flexible swords greedily licking up blood.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13116src" href="#xd27e13116" name="xd27e13116src">12</a> That
great feast of slaughter, terrible with the rhythmic clapping of hands
on the part of Vet&aacute;las drunk with blood and flesh, and covered
with palpitating corpses for dancers, gave great delight to the
demons.</p>
<p>Then M&aacute;nasavega met Narav&aacute;hanadatta face to face in
the conflict, and the prince himself rushed on him in wrath. And having
rushed on him, that emperor seized the villain by the hair, and at once
cut off his head with his sword. When Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a saw
that, he too sprang forward in a fury, and Narav&aacute;hanadatta
dragged him along by the hair, for the power of his science left him as
soon as he saw the prince, and flung him on the ground, and seizing his
legs whirled him round in the air, and dashed him to pieces on a rock.
In this way he slew Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and
M&aacute;nasavega; and the rest of their army, being
terrified,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13124src" href="#xd27e13124"
name="xd27e13124src">13</a> took to flight. And a rain of flowers fell
into the lap of that emperor, and all the gods in heaven exclaimed,
&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with all those
kings that followed him, entered the palace of
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a; and immediately the chiefs of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, who were connected with
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s party, came and submitted humbly
to his sway.</p>
<p>Then Dhanavat&iacute; came up to that sovereign in the midst of the
rejoicings on account of his having taken possession of his kingdom
after slaying all his enemies, and said to him, &ldquo;My liege,
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a has left a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb456" href="#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>daughter named
Ih&aacute;tmatik&aacute;, the belle of the three worlds; you should
marry that maiden.&rdquo; When she said this to the king, he
immediately sent for the girl, and married her, and passed the day very
happily in her society.</p>
<p>The next morning he sent Vegavat&iacute; and
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, and had Madanamanchuk&aacute; brought by them
from the town of M&aacute;nasavega. When brought, she looked upon that
hero in his prosperity, who had destroyed the darkness of his enemies,
with face expanded and wet with tears of joy; and at the end of her
night of separation she enjoyed indescribable happiness, like a
lotus-bed, the open flowers of which are wet with dew. Then he bestowed
on her all the sciences, and having pined for her long, he exulted in
the society of his beloved, who had thus in a moment attained the rank
of a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;. And in the garden of
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a&rsquo;s city he spent those days with his
wives in the joys of a banquet. And then he sent
Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute;, and had Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as also
brought there, and bestowed on her the sciences.</p>
<p>And one day, as the emperor was sitting in his hall of audience, two
Vidy&aacute;dharas came and said to him with due respect, &ldquo;Your
majesty, we went hence, by the orders of Dhanavat&iacute;, to the
northern division of the land of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, to find out
the movements of Mandaradeva. And there we, being ourselves invisible,
saw that king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas in his hall of audience, and he
happened to be saying with regard to your Highness, &lsquo;I hear, that
Narav&aacute;hanadatta has obtained the sovereignty over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and has slain Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and the
rest of his opponents; so it will not do for me to overlook that enemy;
on the contrary, I must nip him in the bud.&rsquo; When we heard that
speech of his, we came here to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the assembly of Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s partizans heard
this from the spies, they were all beside themselves with anger, and
appeared like a lotus-bed smitten by the wind. The arms of
Chitr&aacute;ngada, frequently waved and extended, seemed with the
tinkling of their bracelets to be demanding the signal for combat. The
necklace of Amitagati, rising up on his breast, as he sighed with
anger, seemed to say again and again, &ldquo;Rouse thyself, rouse
thyself, hero.&rdquo; Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra, striking the
ground with his hand so that it resounded, seemed to be going through a
prelude introductory to the crushing of his enemies. A frown took its
seat upon the face of V&aacute;yupatha, looking like a bow strung by
Fate for the destruction of his foes. Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, angrily
pressing one hand against the other, seemed to say, &ldquo;Even thus
will I pulverize my enemies.&rdquo; The arm of S&aacute;garadatta,
struck by his hand, produced a sound that rang through the air, and
seemed to challenge that foe. But Narav&aacute;hanadatta, though angry,
was no whit disturbed; for imperturbability is the characteristic sign
of the greatness of great ones. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457"
href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he resolved to march forth to conquer his enemy, after
obtaining the jewels essential to an emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.
So the emperor mounted a chariot, with his wives and his ministers, and
set out from that Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a. And all his partizans, the
kings of the Gandharvas and the chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
accompanied by their armies, marched along with him, encircling him, as
the planets do the moon. Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta reached the
Him&aacute;layas, preceded by Dhanavat&iacute;, and found there a large
lake. With its white lotuses like lofty umbrellas and its soaring swans
like waving chowries, it seemed to have brought a present fit for a
sovereign. With its lofty waves flung up towards him like beckoning
hands at no great distance, it seemed to summon him again and again to
take the bath which should ensure him supreme sovereignty. Then
V&aacute;yupatha said to the king, &ldquo;My emperor, you must go down
and bathe in this lake;&rdquo; so he went down to bathe in it. And a
heavenly voice said, &ldquo;None but an emperor can ever succeed in
bathing in this lake, so now you may consider the imperial dignity
secured to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the emperor heard that, he was delighted, and he sported in the
water of that lake with his wives, as Varu&#7751;a does in the sea. He
took pleasure in watching them with the moist garments clinging to
their bodies, with the fastenings of their hair loosened, and their
eyes reddened by the washing into them of antimony. The rows of birds,
flying up with loud cries from that lake, appeared like the girdles of
its presiding nymphs advancing to meet him. And the lotuses, eclipsed
by the beauty of the lotus-like faces of his wives, plunged beneath the
waves as if ashamed. And after bathing, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with
his attendants, spent that day on the bank of that lake.</p>
<p>There the successful prince, with his wives and ministers, spent his
time in jocose conversation, and next morning he set forth thence in
his chariot with his army. And as he was going along, he reached the
city of V&aacute;yupatha, which lay in his way; and he stayed there a
day to please him. There he fell in love with a maiden, that he came
across in a garden, the sister of V&aacute;yupatha, by name
V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as. She, while amusing herself in a garden on
the bank of the Hemab&aacute;luka<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13151src"
href="#xd27e13151" name="xd27e13151src">14</a> river, saw him arrive,
and though in love with him, disappeared at once. Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, supposing that she had turned her back on him
for some reason other than the real one, returned with downcast face to
his quarters. There the queens found out the adventure that had
befallen the king by means of Marubh&uacute;ti who was with him, (for
Gomukha was too clever for them to try him,) and then they made all
kinds of jokes at the king&rsquo;s expense, while Gomukha stood by
ashamed at the indiscretion of Marubh&uacute;ti. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Gomukha, seeing the king out of countenance, consoled him, and,
in order to ascertain the real sentiments of V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as,
went to her city. There V&aacute;yupatha saw him suddenly arrived as if
to take a look at the city, and he lovingly entertained him, and taking
him aside, said to him, &ldquo;I have an unmarried sister named
V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as, and holy seers have prophesied that she is
destined to be the wife of an emperor. So I am desirous of giving her
as a present to the emperor Narav&aacute;hanadatta; pray do your best
to bring about the accomplishment of my wish. And with this very object
in view I was preparing to come to you.&rdquo; When the minister
Gomukha had been thus addressed by V&aacute;yupatha, he said to him;
&ldquo;Although this prince of ours set out primarily with the object
of conquering his enemies, still you have only to make the request, and
I will arrange this matter for you.&rdquo; With these words Gomukha
took leave of him, and going back informed Narav&aacute;hanadatta that
he had gained his object without any solicitation.</p>
<p>And the next day V&aacute;yupatha came in person and requested the
favour, and the sagacious Gomukha said to the king, &ldquo;My prince,
you must not refuse the request of V&aacute;yupatha; he is your
faithful ally; your majesty should do whatever he asks.&rdquo; Then the
king consented to do it; and V&aacute;yupatha himself brought his
younger sister, and bestowed her on the emperor against her will. And
while the marriage was being performed, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Ye
guardians of the world, I am being bestowed in marriage by my brother
by force, and against my will, so I have not committed any sin
thereby.&rdquo; When she said this, all the females belonging to
V&aacute;yupatha&rsquo;s household made such a noise that no outsiders
heard what she said. But the king was put out of countenance by her
speech, so Gomukha was anxious to find some means of ascertaining its
import, and he roamed hither and thither with that object.</p>
<p>And after he had roamed about awhile, he saw in a certain retired
spot four Vidy&aacute;dhara maidens preparing to enter the fire at the
same time. And when he asked them the cause, those fair ones told him
how V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as had broken her solemn agreement. Then
Gomukha went and told it to king Narav&aacute;hanadatta in the presence
of all there, exactly as he had seen and heard. When the king heard it,
he smiled, but V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as said, &ldquo;Arise, my
husband, let us two quickly go and save these maidens; afterwards I
will tell you the reason of this act of theirs.&rdquo; When she said
this to the king, he went with her and with all his followers to the
spot where the tragedy was to take place.</p>
<p>And he saw those maidens with a blazing fire in front of them; and
V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as, after dragging them away from it, said to
the king, &ldquo;This first here is K&aacute;lik&aacute;, the daughter
of the lord of K&aacute;lak&uacute;&#7789;a, and this second is
Vidyutpunj&aacute;, the daughter of Vidyutpunja; and this third is
Matangin&iacute;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459"
name="pb459">459</a>]</span>the daughter of Mandara; and this fourth is
Padmaprabh&aacute; the daughter of Mah&aacute;dansh&#7789;ra; and I am
the fifth; all we five, when we saw you performing asceticism in the
domain of the Siddhas, were bewildered with love, and we made the
following mutual agreement, &lsquo;We will all five<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13165src" href="#xd27e13165" name="xd27e13165src">15</a> at
the same time take this prince as our dear husband, and no one of us
must surrender herself to him alone; if any one of us marries him
separately, the others shall enter the fire to bring down vengeance on
her who has been guilty of such treachery to friends.&rsquo; It was out
of respect for this agreement that I did not wish to marry you
separately; indeed I did not even to-day give myself to you; you, my
husband, and the guardians of the world can bear testimony as to
whether even now I have broken this agreement willingly. So now, my
husband, marry also those friends of mine; and you, my friends, must
not let any other lot befall you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13174src" href="#xd27e13174" name="xd27e13174src">16</a></p>
<p>When she said this, those maidens, who had escaped from death,
rejoiced and embraced one another; and the king was delighted in his
heart. And the fathers of the ladies, hearing what had taken place,
came there immediately, and bestowed their daughters on
Narav&aacute;hanadatta. And those chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
headed by the lord of K&aacute;lak&uacute;&#7789;a,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13182src" href="#xd27e13182" name="xd27e13182src">17</a>
agreed to accept the sovereignty of their son-in-law. Thus
Narav&aacute;hanadatta obtained at one stroke the daughters of five
great Vidy&aacute;dharas, and gained great importance thereby.</p>
<p>And the prince remained there some days with those wives, and then
his Commander-in-Chief Hari&#347;ikha said, &ldquo;Why, my liege,
though you are versed in the approved treatises on the subject, do you
act contrary to policy? What means this devotion on your part to the
pleasures of love, when it is time to fight? This raising of an
expedition to conquer Mandaradeva, and this your dallying for so many
days with your wives, are things wholly incompatible.&rdquo; When
Hari&#347;ikha said this, the great king answered him, &ldquo;Your
reproof is just, but I am not acting for my own pleasure in all this;
this allying of myself with wives involves the acquisition of friends;
and is so the most efficacious method at present of crushing the foe;
this is why I have had recourse to it. So let these my troops now
advance to the conquest of the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had given this order, his father-in-law Mandara said
to him, &ldquo;King, that Mandaradeva lives in a distant and difficult
country, and he will be hard for you to overcome until you have
achieved all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460"
name="pb460">460</a>]</span>distinctive jewels of an emperor. For he is
protected by the cave, called the cave of
Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13197src" href=
"#xd27e13197" name="xd27e13197src">18</a> which forms the approach to
his kingdom, and the entrance of which is guarded by the great champion
Devam&aacute;ya. But that cave can be forced by an emperor who has
obtained the jewels. And the sandal-wood tree, which is one of the
jewels of an emperor, is in this country, so quickly gain possession of
it, in order that you may attain the ends you have in view. For no one
who is not an emperor ever gets near that tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having heard this from Mandara, Narav&aacute;hanadatta set out at
night, fasting and observing a strict vow, for that sandal-wood tree.
As the hero went along, very terrible portents arose to bewilder him,
but he was not terrified at them, and so he reached the foot of that
mighty tree. And when he saw that sandal-wood tree surrounded with a
lofty platform made of precious jewels, he climbed up to it with
ladders and adored it. The tree then said to him with bodiless voice,
&ldquo;Emperor, thou hast won me the sandal-wood tree, and when thou
thinkest on me, I will appear to thee, so leave this place at present,
and go to Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a; thus thou wilt win the other jewels
also; and then thou wilt easily conquer Mandaradeva.&rdquo; On hearing
this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the mighty sovereign of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and being now
completely successful, he worshipped that heavenly tree,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13202src" href="#xd27e13202" name=
"xd27e13202src">19</a> and went delighted through the air to his own
camp.</p>
<p>There he spent that night; and the next morning in the hall of
audience he related at full length, in the presence of all, his
night&rsquo;s adventure by which he had won the sandal-wood tree. And
when they heard it, his wives, and the ministers who had grown up with
him from infancy, and those Vidy&aacute;dharas who were devoted to him,
namely, V&aacute;yupatha and the other chiefs with their forces, and
the Gandharvas, headed by Chitr&aacute;ngada, were delighted at this
sudden attainment of great success, and praised his heroism remarkable
for its uninterrupted flow of courage, enterprise, and firmness. And
after deliberating with them, the king, determined to overthrow the
pride of Mandaradeva, set out in a heavenly chariot for the mountain of
Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a, in order to obtain the other jewels spoken of
by the sandal-wood tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href=

<p class="first">May Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, who at night seems with the

dance, to be feeding the stars, dispel your darkness!</p>
<p>Then, as the emperor Narav&aacute;hanadatta was in his hall of
audience on the mountain Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a, a Vidy&aacute;dhara
named Am&#7771;itaprabha came to him through the air, the same who had
before saved him, when he was flung down by his enemy on the Mountain
of Fire. That Vidy&aacute;dhara came and humbly made himself known, and
having been lovingly entertained by that emperor, said to him,
&ldquo;There is a great mountain named Malaya in the southern region;
and in a hermitage on it lives a great hermit named <span class="corr"
id="xd27e13238" title="Source: Vamadeva">V&aacute;madeva</span>. He, my
liege, invites you to come to him alone for the sake of some important
affair, and on this account he has sent me to you to-day. Moreover you
are my sovereign, won by previous merits; and therefore have I come; so
come along with me; let us quickly go to that hermit in order to ensure
your success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that Vidy&aacute;dhara had said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta
left his wives and forces there, and himself flew up into the air with
that Vidy&aacute;dhara, and in that way quickly reached the Malaya
mountain, and approached the hermit V&aacute;madeva. And he beheld that
hermit white with age, tall of stature, with eye-balls sparkling like
bright jewels in the fleshless sockets of his eyes, the depository of
the jewels of the emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, with his matted
hair waving like creepers, looking like the Him&aacute;laya range
accompanying the prince, to assist him in attaining success. Then the
prince worshipped the feet of that sage, and he entertained him, and
said to him, &ldquo;You are the god of Love consumed long ago by
&#346;iva, and appointed by him emperor of all the Vidy&aacute;dhara
chiefs, because he was pleased with Rati.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13243src" href="#xd27e13243" name="xd27e13243src">1</a> Now, I
have in this my hermitage, within the deep recess of an inner cave,
certain jewels, which I will point out to you, and you must seize them.
For you will find Mandaradeva easy enough to conquer, after you have
obtained the jewels; and it was with this object that I invited you
hither by the command of <span class="corr" id="xd27e13246" title=
"Source: Siva">&#346;iva</span>.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb462" href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the hermit had said this to him, and had instructed him in the
right method of procedure, Narav&aacute;hanadatta joyfully entered that
cave. In it the hero overcame many and various obstacles, and then he
beheld a huge furious elephant charging him with a deep guttural roar.
The king smote it on the forehead with his fist, and placed his feet on
its tusks, and actively mounted that furious elephant. And a bodiless
voice came from the cave, &ldquo;Bravo, emperor! thou<a id="xd27e13252"
name="xd27e13252"></a> hast won the jewel of the mighty
elephant.&rdquo; Then he saw a sword looking like a mighty snake, and
he fell upon it, and seized it, as if it were the locks of the Fortune
of Empire. Again a bodiless voice sounded in the cave, &ldquo;Bravo,
conqueror of thy foes! thou hast obtained the victorious
sword-jewel.&rdquo; Then he obtained the moonlight-jewel and the
wife-jewel, and the jewel of charms, named the destroying charm. And
thus having achieved in all seven jewels (useful in time of need, and
bestowers of majesty<span class="corr" id="xd27e13254" title=
"Source: ,)">),</span> taking into account the two first, the lake and
the sandal-wood tree, he went out from that cave and told the hermit
V&aacute;madeva that he had succeeded in accomplishing all his
objects<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13259src" href="#xd27e13259" name=

<p>Then the hermit said lovingly to that emperor, &ldquo;Go, my son,
now that you have obtained the jewels of a great emperor, and conquer
Mandaradeva on the north side of Kail&aacute;sa, and enjoy the glorious
fortune of the sovereignty of both sides of that mountain.&rdquo; When
the hermit had said this to him, the successful emperor bowed before
him, and went off through the air with Am&#7771;itaprabha. And in a
moment he reached his camp on Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a guarded by his
mighty mother-in-law Dhanavat&iacute;. Then those kings of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, that had sided with him, and his wives and his
ministers, who were all watching for him, saw him, and welcomed him
with delight. Then he sat down and they questioned him, and he told
them how he had seen the hermit V&aacute;madeva, and how he had entered
the cave, and how he had obtained the jewels. Then a great festival
took place there, in which celestial drums were joyfully beaten, and
the Vidy&aacute;dharas danced, and people generally were drunk with

<p>And the next day, in a moment in which a malignant planet stood in
the house of his foe, and one which argued his own success<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13278src" href="#xd27e13278" name=
"xd27e13278src">3</a> as a planet benignant to him, predominated over
his enemy&rsquo;s house, and which was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb463" href="#pb463" name="pb463">463</a>]</span>fraught with every
other kind of prosperity, Narav&aacute;hanadatta performed the
ceremonies for good fortune, and ascended that car made by
Brahm&aacute;, which &#346;iva had bestowed on him, and set out with
his army through the air, accompanied by his wives, to conquer
Mandaradeva. And various heroes, his followers, marched surrounding
him, and kings of the Gandharvas and chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
fearless and faithful, obedient to the orders of the general
Hari&#347;ikha, and Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, with his mother the wise
Dhanavat&iacute;, and the brave Pingalag&aacute;ndh&aacute;ra, and
V&aacute;yupatha the strong, and Vidyutpunja and Amitagati, and the
lord of K&aacute;lak&uacute;&#7789;a, and Mandara, and
Mah&aacute;dansh&#7789;ra and his own friend Am&#7771;itaprabha, and
the hero Chitr&aacute;ngada with S&aacute;garadatta,&mdash;all these,
and others who were there of the party of the slain
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, pressed eagerly after him, with their
hosts, as he advanced intent on victory. Then the sky was obscured by
his army, and the sun hid his face, as if for shame, somewhere or
other, his brightness being eclipsed by the splendour of the
monarch.</p>
<p>Then the emperor passed the M&aacute;nasa lake haunted by troops of
divine hermits, and left behind him Ga&#7751;&#7693;as&aacute;ila the
pleasure-garden of the nymphs of heaven, and reached the foot of mount
Kail&aacute;sa gleaming white like crystal, resembling a mass of his
own glory.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13294src" href="#xd27e13294"
name="xd27e13294src">4</a> There he encamped on the bank of the
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;, and while he was sitting there, the wise chief
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Mandara, came up to him, and addressed
to him the following pleasing speech, &ldquo;Let your army halt here,
king, on the bank of the river of the gods! It is not fitting that you
should advance over this mountain Kail&aacute;sa. For all sciences are
destroyed by crossing this dwelling-place of &#346;iva. So you must
pass to the other side of the mountain by the cave of
Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha. And it is guarded by a king named
Devam&aacute;ya, who is exceedingly haughty; so how can you advance
further without conquering him?&rdquo; When Mandara said this,
Dhanavat&iacute; approved it, and Narav&aacute;hanadatta waited there
for a day.</p>
<p>While he was there, he sent an ambassador to Devam&aacute;ya with a
conciliatory message, but he did not receive the order it conveyed in a
conciliatory spirit. So the next day the emperor moved out against
Devam&aacute;ya with all the allied kings prepared for battle. And
Devam&aacute;ya too, when he heard it, marched out towards him to give
battle, accompanied by numerous kings, Var&aacute;ha, Vajramush&#7789;i
and others, and followed by his army. Then there took place on
Kail&aacute;sa a battle between those two armies, and while it was
going on, the sky was obscured by the chariots of the gods who came to
look on. Terrible was that thunder-cloud of war, awful with the dense
hailstorm of many severed heads, and loud with the shouting of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>heroes. That Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha slew
Var&aacute;ha the general of Devam&aacute;ya, as he fought in the front
rank, was in truth by no means wonderful; but it was strange that
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, without employing any magic power, took captive
Devam&aacute;ya himself, when exhausted by the wounds he received from
him in the combat. And when he was captured, his army was broken, and
fled, together with the great champions Vajramush&#7789;i,
Mah&aacute;b&aacute;hu, Tiksh&#7751;adansh&#7789;ra and their fellows.
Then the gods in their chariots exclaimed, &ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo;
and all present congratulated the victorious emperor. Then that mighty
monarch consoled Devam&aacute;ya, who was brought before him bound, and
welcomed him kindly, and set him at liberty. But he, having been
subdued by the emperor&rsquo;s arm, humbly submitted to him, together
with Vajramush&#7789;i and the others.</p>
<p>Then, the battle having come to an end, that day passed away, and
next morning Devam&aacute;ya came to the place of audience, and stood
by the side of the emperor, and when questioned by him about the cave
of Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha, which he wished to enter, related the
following true history of it.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old time, my liege, the two sides of mount
Kail&aacute;sa, the north and the south side, formed different
kingdoms, having been assigned to distinguished Vidy&aacute;dharas.
Then one, &#7770;ishabha by name, propitiated &#346;iva with
austerities, and was appointed by that god emperor over both of them.
But one day he was passing over Kail&aacute;sa to go to the northern
side, and lost his magic science owing to the anger of &#346;iva, who
happened to be below, and so fell from the sky. &#7770;ishabha again
propitiated &#346;iva with severe asceticism, and the god again
appointed him Supreme Sovereign of both sides; so he thus humbly
addressed the god, &ldquo;I am not permitted to pass over
Kail&aacute;sa, so by what path am I to travel in order to be able to
exercise my prerogatives on both sides of the mountain?&rdquo; When
&#346;iva, the trident-bearing god, heard this, he cleft asunder
Kail&aacute;sa, and made this cave-like opening for &#7770;ishabha to
pass to the northern side.</p>
<p>Then mount Kail&aacute;sa, having been pierced, was despondent, and
addressed this petition to &#346;iva, &ldquo;Holy one, this north side
of me used to be inaccessible to mortals, but it has now been made
accessible to them by this cave-passage; so provide that this law of
exclusion be not broken.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had been thus
supplicated by the mountain, he placed in the cave as guards, elephants
of the quarters, mighty basilisks,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13313src"
href="#xd27e13313" name="xd27e13313src">5</a> and Guhyakas; and at its
southern opening he placed Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya the Vidy&aacute;dhara
chief, and at its northern opening K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri the
invincible Cha&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13319src" href="#xd27e13319" name="xd27e13319src">6</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span></p>
<p>When &#346;iva had thus provided for the guarding of the cave, he
produced great jewels, and made this decree with regard to the cave,
&ldquo;This cave shall be open at both ends to any one who has obtained
the jewels, and is emperor over the Vidy&aacute;dharas with their wives
and their messengers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13325src" href=
"#xd27e13325" name="xd27e13325src">7</a> and to those who may be
appointed by him as sovereigns over the northern side of the
mountain,&mdash;by these, I say, it may be passed, but by no one else
in the world.&rdquo; When the three-eyed god had made this decree,
&#7770;isbabha went on holding sway over the Vidy&aacute;dharas, but in
his pride made war on the gods and was slain by Indra. This is the
history, my liege, of the cave, named the cave of
Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha; and the cave cannot be passed by any but persons
like yourself.</p>
<p>And in course of time I Devam&aacute;ya was born in the family of
Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya the keeper of the entrance of the cave. And at
my birth a heavenly voice proclaimed, &ldquo;There is now born among
the Vidy&aacute;dharas a champion hard for his foes to conquer in
fight; and he, who shall conquer him, shall be emperor over them; he
shall be the master of this child now born, and shall be followed by
him as a lord.&rdquo; I, that Devam&aacute;ya, have been now conquered
by you, and you have obtained the jewels, and are the mighty sole
emperor of both sides of mount Kail&aacute;sa,&mdash;the lord of us all
here. So, now pass the cave of Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha, and conquer the
rest of your enemies.</p>
<p>When Devam&aacute;ya had told the story of the cave in these words,
the emperor said to him, &ldquo;We will march now and encamp for the
present at the mouth of the cave, and to-morrow morning, after we have
performed due ceremonies, we will enter it.&rdquo; When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta had said this, he went and encamped with all
those kings at the mouth of the cave. And he saw that underground
passage with deep rayless cavity, looking like the birthplace of the
sunless and moonless darkness of the day of doom.</p>
<p>And the next day he offered worship, and entered it in his chariot,
with his followers, assisted by the glorious jewels, which presented
themselves to him, when he thought of them. He dispelled the darkness
with the moonlight jewel, the basilisks with the sandal-wood tree, the
elephants of the quarters with the elephant-jewel, the Guhyakas with
the sword-jewel, and other obstacles with other jewels; and so passed
that cave with his army, and emerged at its northern mouth. And coming
out from the bowels of the cave, he saw before him the northern side of
the mountain, looking like another world, entered without a second
birth. And then a voice came from the sky, &ldquo;Bravo, emperor! thou
hast passed this cave by means of the majesty conferred by the power of
the jewels.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466"
name="pb466">466</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Dhanavat&iacute; and Devam&aacute;ya said to the emperor,
&ldquo;Your Majesty, K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri is always near this
opening. She was originally created by Vish&#7751;u, when the sea was
churned for the nectar, in order that she might tear in pieces the
chiefs of the D&aacute;navas, who wished to steal that heavenly drink.
And now she has been placed here by &#346;iva to guard this cave, in
order that none may pass it, except those beings like yourself, of whom
we spoke before. You are our emperor, and you have obtained the jewels,
and have passed this cave; so, in order to gain the victory, you must
worship this goddess, who is a meet object of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such words did Dhanavat&iacute; and Devam&aacute;ya address
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and so the day waned for him there. And the
northern peaks of Kail&aacute;sa were reddened with the evening light,
and seemed thus to foreshadow the bloodshed of the approaching battle.
The darkness, having gained power, obscured the army of that king, as
if recollecting its animosity against him for his recent victory over
it in its home the cave; an animosity which was still fresh and new.
And goblins, vampires, jackals, and the sisterhood<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13345src" href="#xd27e13345" name="xd27e13345src">8</a> of
witches roamed about, as it were the first shoots of the anger of
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri enraged on account of Narav&aacute;hanadatta
having omitted to worship her. And in a moment the whole army of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta became insensible, as if with sleep, but he
alone remained in full possession of his faculties. Then the emperor
perceived that this was a display of power on the part of
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri, angry because she had not been worshipped, and
be proceeded to worship her with flowers of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art the power of life, animating all creatures, of
loving nature, skilful in directing the discus to the head of thy foes;
thee I adore. Hail! thou, that under the form of Durg&aacute; dost
console the world with thy trident and other weapons streaming with the
drops of blood flowing from the throat of the slain Mahisha. Thou art
victorious dancing with a skull full of the blood of Ruru in thy
agitated hand, as if thou wast holding the vessel of security of the
three worlds. Goddess beloved of &#346;iva, with uplifted eyes, though
thy name means the night of doom, still, with skull surmounted by a
burning candle, and with a skull in thy hand, thou dost shine as if
with the sun and moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he praised K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri in these words, she was
not propitiated, and then he made up his mind to appease her by the
sacrifice of his head; and he drew his sword for that purpose. Then the
goddess said to him, &ldquo;Do not act rashly my son. Lo! I have been
won over by thee, thou hero. Let this thy army be as it was before, and
be thou victorious!&rdquo; And immediately his army awoke as it were
from sleep. Then his wives, and his companions, and all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas praised the might of that emperor. And the hero,
having eaten and drunk and performed the necessary duties, spent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>that night, which seemed as long as if it
consisted of a hundred watches instead of three.</p>
<p>And the next morning he worshipped K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri, and
marched thence to engage Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha, who had barred his
further advance with an army of Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then the emperor
had a fight with that king, who was the principal champion of
Mandaradeva, of such a desperate character, that the air was full of
swords, the earth covered with the heads of warriors, and the only
speech heard was the terrible cry of heroes shouting, &ldquo;Slay!
slay!&rdquo; Then the emperor took Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha captive in
that battle by force, and afterwards treated him with deference; and
made him submit to his sway. And he quartered his army that night in
his city, and the host seemed like fuel consumed with fire, as it had
seen the extinction of Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha&rsquo;s<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13357src" href="#xd27e13357" name="xd27e13357src">9</a>
pride.</p>
<p>And the next day, hearing from the scouts that Mandaradeva, having
found out what had taken place, was advancing to meet him in fight,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta marched out against him with the chiefs of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, determined to conquer him. And after he had gone
some distance, he beheld in front of him the army of Mandaradeva,
accompanied by many kings, attacking in order of battle. Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with the allied kings at his side, drew up his
forces in an arrangement fitted to encounter the formation of his
enemies, and fell upon his army.</p>
<p>Then a battle took place between those two armies, which imitated
the disturbed flood of the ocean overflowing its banks at the day of
doom. On one side were fighting Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and other great
champions, and on the other K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra and other
mighty kings. And the battle waxed sore, resembling the rising of the
wind at the day of doom, for it made the three worlds tremble, and
shook the mountains. Mount Kail&aacute;sa, red on one side with the
blood of heroes, as with saffron paint, and on the other of ashy
whiteness, resembled the husband of Gaur&iacute;. That great battle was
truly the day of doom for heroes, being grimly illuminated by
innumerable orbs of the sun arisen in flashing sword-blades. Such was
the battle that even N&aacute;rada and other heavenly beings, who came
to gaze at it, were astonished, though they had witnessed the fights
between the gods and the Asuras.</p>
<p>In this fight, which was thus terrible,
K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra rushed on Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, and
smote him on the head with a formidable mace. When Dhanavat&iacute; saw
that her son had fallen under the stroke of the mace, she cursed and
paralysed both armies by means of her magic power. And
Narav&aacute;hanadatta on one side, in virtue of his imperial
might,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13366src" href="#xd27e13366" name=
"xd27e13366src">10</a> and on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468"
href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>other side, Mandaradeva were
the only two that remained conscious. Then even the gods in the air
fled in all directions, seeing that Dhanavat&iacute;, if angry, had
power to destroy a world.</p>
<p>But Mandaradeva, seeing that the emperor Narav&aacute;hanadatta was
left alone, ran upon him with uplifted weapon. Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
for his part, descended from his chariot, and drawing the sword which
was one of his imperial jewels, quickly met him. Then Mandaradeva,
wishing to gain the victory by magic arts, assumed by his science the
form of a furious elephant maddened with passion. When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was endowed with pre-eminent skill in
magic, saw this, he assumed by his supernatural power the form of a
lion. Then Mandaradeva flung off the body of an elephant, and
Narav&aacute;hanadatta abandoned that of a lion, and fought with him
openly in his own shape.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13403src" href=
"#xd27e13403" name="xd27e13403src">11</a> Armed with sabres, and
skilled in every elaborate trick and attitude of fence, they appeared
like two actors skilled in gesticulation, engaged in acting a
pantomime. Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta by a dexterous sleight forced
from the grasp of Mandaradeva his sword the material symbol of victory.
And Mandaradeva, having been thus deprived of his sword, drew his
dagger, but the emperor quickly made him relinquish that in the same
way. Then Mandaradeva, being disarmed, began to wrestle with the
emperor, but he seized him by the ancles, and laid him on the
earth.</p>
<p>And then the sovereign set his foot on his enemy&rsquo;s breast, and
laying hold of his hair, was preparing to cut off his head with his
sword, when the maiden Mandaradev&iacute;, the sister of Mandaradeva,
rushed up to him, and in order to prevent him, said, &ldquo;When I saw
you long ago in the wood of ascetics, I marked you for my future
husband, so do not, my sovereign, kill this brother of mine, who is
your brother-in-law.&rdquo; When the resolute king had been thus
addressed by that fair-eyed one, he let go Mandaradeva, who was ashamed
at having been conquered, and said to him, &ldquo;I set you at liberty;
do not be ashamed on that account, Vidy&aacute;dhara chief; victory and
defeat in war bestow themselves on heroes with varying caprice.&rdquo;
When the king said this, Mandaradeva answered him, &ldquo;Of what
profit is my life to me, now that I have been saved in war by a woman?
So I will go to my father in the wood where he is, and perform
asceticism; you have been appointed emperor over both divisions of our
territory here. Indeed this occurrence was foretold long ago to me by
my father as sure to take place.&rdquo; When the proud hero had said
this, he repaired to his father in the grove of ascetics.</p>
<p>Then the gods, that were present in the air on that occasion,
exclaimed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>&ldquo;Bravo! great emperor, you have completely
conquered your enemies, and obtained sovereign sway.&rdquo; When
Mandaradeva had gone, Dhanavat&iacute; by her power restored her own
son and both armies with him to consciousness. So <span class="corr"
id="xd27e13412" title=
"Source: Narav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s">Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s</span>
followers, ministers and all, arose as it were from sleep, and finding
out that the foe had been conquered, congratulated
Narav&aacute;hanadatta their victorious master. And the kings of
Mandaradeva&rsquo;s party, K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra, A&#347;okaka,
Rakt&aacute;ksha, K&aacute;lajihva and the others, submitted to the
sway of Narav&aacute;hanadatta. And Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha, when he
saw K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra, remembered the blow of the mace,
which he received from him in fight, and was wroth with him,
brandishing his good sword firmly grasped in his strong hand. But
Dhanavat&iacute; said to him, &ldquo;Enough of wrath, my beloved son!
Who could conquer you in the van of battle? But I myself produced that
momentary glamour, in order to prevent the destruction of both
armies.&rdquo; With these words she pacified her son and made him cease
from wrath, and she delighted the whole army and the emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13415src" href=
"#xd27e13415" name="xd27e13415src">12</a> by her magic skill. And
Narav&aacute;hanadatta was exceedingly joyful, having obtained the
sovereignty of the north side of Kail&aacute;sa, the mountain of
&#346;iva, a territory now free from the scourge of war, since the
heroes, who opposed him, had been conquered, or had submitted, or fled,
and that too with all his friends unharmed. Then shrill kettle-drums
were beaten for the great festival of his victory over his
enemies,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13424src" href="#xd27e13424" name=
"xd27e13424src">13</a> and the triumphant monarch, accompanied by his
wives and ministers, and girt with mighty kings, spent that day, which
was honoured by the splendid dances and songs of the Vidy&aacute;dhara
ladies, in drinking wine, as it were the fiery valour of his
enemies.</p>

<p class="first">Then, the next day, the emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with his army, left that plateau of
Kail&aacute;sa, and by the advice of king
K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra, who shewed him the way, went to that
city of Mandaradeva named Vimala. And he reached that city, which was
<span class="corr" id="xd27e13438" title=
"Source: adored">adorned</span> with lofty ramparts of gold, and looked
like mount Sumeru come to adore Kail&aacute;sa, and entering it, found
that it resembled the sea in all but the presence of water, being very
deep, characterized by unfailing prosperity,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13441src" href="#xd27e13441" name="xd27e13441src">1</a> and an
inexhaustible mine of jewels. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470"
href="#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span></p>
<p>And as the emperor was sitting in the hall of audience in that city
surrounded by Vidy&aacute;dhara kings, an old woman of the royal harem
came and said to him, &ldquo;Since Mandaradeva has gone to the forest,
having been conquered by you, his wives desire to enter the fire; your
Highness has now been informed and will decide upon the proper
course.&rdquo; When this had been announced, the emperor sent those
kings to them, and dissuaded them from suicide, and bestowed upon them
dwelling-houses and other gifts, treating them like sisters. By that
step he caused the whole race of the Vidy&aacute;dhara chiefs to be
bound to him with bonds of affection.</p>
<p>And then the grateful monarch anointed Amitagati, who had been
designated beforehand by &#346;iva, king over the realm of Mandaradeva,
since he was loyal and could be trusted not to fall away, and he placed
under him the princes who had followed Mandaradeva, namely,
K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra and his fellows. And he diverted himself
there in splendid gardens for seven days, being caressed by the fortune
of the northern side of Kail&aacute;sa, as by a newly-married
bride.</p>
<p>And then, though he had acquired the imperial authority over the
Vidy&aacute;dhara kings of both divisions, he began to long for more.
He set out, though his ministers tried to dissuade him, to conquer the
inaccessible fields of Meru situated in the northern region, the home
of the gods. For high-spirited men, though abundantly loaded with
possessions, cannot rest without acquiring something still more
glorious, advancing like blazing forest-fires.</p>
<p>Then the hermit N&aacute;rada came and said to the king,
&ldquo;Prince, what means this striving after things out of your reach,
though you know policy? For one who out of overweening self-confidence
attempts the impossible, is disgraced like R&aacute;va&#7751;a, who, in
his pride, endeavoured to uproot Kail&aacute;sa. For even the sun and
moon find Meru hard to overstep; moreover, &#346;iva has not bestowed
on you the sway over the gods, but the sway over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. You have already conquered the Him&aacute;layas,
the home of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, so what need have you of Meru the
home of the gods? Dismiss from your mind this chimerical scheme.
Moreover, if you desire good fortune, you must go and visit the father
of Mandaradeva, Akampana by name, in the forest, where he is
residing.&rdquo; When the hermit N&aacute;rada had said this, the
emperor consented to do as he directed, and so he took leave of him,
and returned whence he came.</p>
<p>And the politic emperor, having been advised by N&aacute;rada to
relinquish his enterprise,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13455src" href=
"#xd27e13455" name="xd27e13455src">2</a> and remembering the
destruction of &#7770;ishabha, of which he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>had
heard from Devam&aacute;ya, and having reflected over the matter in his
own mind, gave up the idea, and went to visit the kingly sage Akampana
in the grove of ascetics. And when he reached that ascetic grove, it
was crowded with great sages, engaged in contemplation, sitting in the
posture called <i>padm&aacute;sana</i>, and so resembled the world of
Brahm&aacute;. There he saw that aged Akampana, wearing matted hair and
a deerskin, looking like a great tree resorted to by hermits. So he
went and worshipped the feet of that ascetic, and that royal sage
welcomed him and said to him, &ldquo;You have done well, king, in
coming to this hermitage, for if you had passed on neglectful of it,
these hermits here would have cursed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the royal sage was saying this to the emperor, Mandaradeva,
who was staying in that grove of ascetics, having taken the vows of a
hermit, came to his father, accompanied by his sister, the princess
Mandaradev&iacute;. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, when he saw him,
embraced him, for it is fitting that truly brave men should show
kindness to foes when conquered and pacified.</p>
<p>Then the royal sage Akampana, seeing Mandaradev&iacute; come with
her brother, said to that emperor, &ldquo;Here, king, is my daughter,
Mandaradev&iacute; by name; and a heavenly voice said that she should
be the consort of an emperor; so marry her, emperor, for I give her to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the royal sage said this, his daughter said, &ldquo;I have four
companions here, of like age, noble maidens; one is a maiden called
Kanakavat&iacute;, the daughter of K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra; the
second is the daughter of K&aacute;lajihva, K&aacute;lavat&iacute; by
name; the third is the offspring of D&iacute;rghadansh&#7789;ra named
&#346;rut&aacute;; the fourth is the daughter of the king of
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ra, named Ambaraprabh&aacute;; and I am the fifth of
those Vidy&aacute;dhara maidens. We five, when roaming about, saw
previously in a grove of ascetics this my destined husband, and setting
our hearts on him, we made an agreement together that we would all, at
one and the same time, take him for our husband, but that, if any
single one married him alone, the others should enter the fire, and lay
the guilt at her door. So it is not fitting that I should marry without
those friends of mine; for how could persons like myself commit the
outrageous crime of breaking plighted faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that self-possessed lady had said this, her father Akampana
summoned those four <span class="corr" id="xd27e13474" title=
"Source: Vidyadhara">Vidy&aacute;dhara</span> chiefs, who were the
fathers of the four maidens, and told them exactly what had occurred,
and they immediately thought themselves very fortunate, and brought
those maidens their daughters. Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta married the
five in order, beginning with Mandaradev&iacute;. And he remained there
with them many days, worshipping the hermits three times a day, at
dawn, noon, and sunset, while his attendants held high festival.</p>
<p>And Akampana said to him, &ldquo;King, you must now go to the
&#7770;ishabha <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name=
"pb472">472</a>]</span>mountain for the great ceremony of your
coronation,&rdquo; and thereupon Devam&aacute;ya also said to him,
&ldquo;King, you must indeed do so, for the emperors of old time,
&#7770;ishabhaka and others, were anointed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13482src" href="#xd27e13482" name="xd27e13482src">3</a> on that
mountain.&rdquo; When Hari&#347;ikha heard that, he spoke in favour of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s being anointed emperor on the splendid
mountain of Mandara, which was near; but then a voice came from heaven,
&ldquo;King, all former emperors went through the ceremony of their
coronation on the &#7770;ishabha mountain; do you also go there, for it
is a holy place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13485src" href=
"#xd27e13485" name="xd27e13485src">4</a> When the heavenly voice said
this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta bowed before the hermits and Akampana, and
set out thence for that mountain on an auspicious day. And he reached
that northern opening of the cave of Tri&#347;&iacute;rsha, with many
great chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas headed by Amitagati. There the
emperor worshipped that K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri, and entered the cave
by that opening, and came out by the southern opening. And after he had
come out with his forces, he rested, at Devam&aacute;ya&rsquo;s
request, in his palace for that day, together with his attendants.</p>
<p>And while he was there, he reflected that &#346;iva was near him on
that mountain of Kail&aacute;sa, and he went of his own accord, with
Gomukha, to visit the god. And when he reached his hermitage, he saw
and adored the cow Surabhi and the sacred bull, and approached Nandin
the door-keeper. And Nandin was pleased when the king circumambulated
him, and opened the door to him, and then he entered and beheld
&#346;iva accompanied by Dev&iacute;. The god diffused gladness afar by
the streams of rays from the moon on his crest, that seemed to dart
hither and thither as if conquered by the splendour of
Gaur&iacute;&rsquo;s face. He was playing with his beloved with dice,
that, like eyes, were allowed at will to pursue their objects
independently,&mdash;that, though under his command, were ever
restlessly rolling. And when Narav&aacute;hanadatta saw that giver of
boons, and that goddess the daughter of the Mountain, he fell at their
feet, and circumambulated them three times. The god said to him,
&ldquo;It is well, my son, that thou hast come hither; for otherwise
thou mightest have suffered loss. But now all thy magic powers shall
ever be unfailing. So go thou to the &#7770;ishabha mountain, that holy
place, and obtain there at once in fitting time thy great
inauguration.&rdquo; When the emperor had received this command from
the god, he hastened to obey it, exclaiming &ldquo;I will do thy
will,&rdquo; and bowed before him and his wife, and returned to that
palace of Devam&aacute;ya. The queen Madanamanchuk&aacute; playfully
said to him on his return, &ldquo;Where have you been, my husband? You
appear to be pleased. Have you managed to pick up here another set of
five maidens?&rdquo; When she made use of these playful taunts, the
prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href="#pb473" name=
"pb473">473</a>]</span>gladdened her by telling her the real state of
affairs, and remained with her in happiness.</p>
<p>And the next day, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, accompanied by a host of
Gandharvas and Vidy&aacute;dharas, making, as it were, a second sun in
the heavens by his glorious presence, ascended his splendid car, with
his wives and his ministers, and made for the &#7770;ishabha mountain.
And when he reached that heavenly hill, the trees, like hermits, with
their creepers like matted hair waving in the wind, shed their flowers
before him by way of a respectful offering. And there various kings of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas brought the preparations for the coronation on a
scale suited to the might of their master. And the Vidy&aacute;dharas
came to his coronation from all quarters, with presents in their hands,
all loyal, terrified, vanquished or respectful.</p>
<p>Then the Vidy&aacute;dharas said to him, &ldquo;Tell us, king; who
is to occupy half your throne, and to be anointed as queen
consort?&rdquo; The king answered, &ldquo;The queen
Madanamanchuk&aacute; is to be anointed together with me;&rdquo; and
this at once set the Vidy&aacute;dharas thinking. Then a bodiless voice
came from the air, &ldquo;Hearken, Vidy&aacute;dharas! This
Madanamanchuk&aacute; is not a mortal; for she is Rati become
incarnate, in order to be the wife of this your master, who is the god
of Love. She was not born to Madanavega by Kalingasen&aacute;, but,
being of superhuman origin, was immediately substituted by the gods,
who employed their deluding power, for the infant to which
Kalingasen&aacute; gave birth.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13499src"
href="#xd27e13499" name="xd27e13499src">5</a> But the infant to which
she gave birth, was named Ityaka, and remained at the side of
Madanavega, having been assigned to him by the Creator. So this
Madanamanchuk&aacute; is worthy to share the throne of her husband, for
&#346;iva long ago granted her this honour as a boon, having been
pleased with her asceticism.&rdquo; When the voice had said so much, it
ceased, and the Vidy&aacute;dharas were pleased, and praised the queen
Madanamanchuk&aacute;.</p>
<p>Then, on an auspicious day, the great hermits sprinkled with water
from many sacred bathing-places, brought in pitchers of gold,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta seated on the imperial throne, while
Madanamanchuk&aacute; occupied the left half of it. And during the
ceremony &#346;&aacute;ntisoma the domestic chaplain was busily
occupied, and the assembled cymbals of the heavenly nymphs resounded
aloud, and the murmur made by Br&aacute;hmans reciting prayers filled
the ten points of the sky. Strange to say! when the water, made more
purifying by holy texts, fell on his head, the secret
defilement<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13504src" href="#xd27e13504"
name="xd27e13504src">6</a> of enmity was washed out from the minds of
his foes. The goddess of fortune seemed to accompany in visible
presence that water of consecration, under the impression that it came
from the sea, and so was a connexion of her own, and to join with it in
covering the body of that king. A series of flower-garlands
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>flung by the hands of the nymphs of heaven,
falling on him, appeared like the Ganges spontaneously descending on
his body with a full stream. Adorned with red unguent and valour, he
appeared like the sun in the glory of rising, washed in the water of
the sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13512src" href="#xd27e13512" name=
"xd27e13512src">7</a></p>
<p>And crowned with a garland of <i>mand&aacute;ra</i> flowers,
resplendent with glorious raiment and ornaments, having donned a
heavenly diadem, he wore the majesty of Indra. And queen
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, having been also anointed, glittered with
heavenly ornaments at his side, like &#346;ach&iacute; at the side of
Indra.</p>
<p>And that day, though drums sounded like clouds, and flowers fell
from the sky like rain, and though it was full<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13530src" href="#xd27e13530" name="xd27e13530src">8</a> of
heavenly nymphs like lightning gleams, was, strange to say, a fair one.
On that occasion, in the city of the chief of mountains, not only did
beautiful Vidy&aacute;dhara ladies dance, but creepers shaken by the
wind danced also; and when cymbals were struck by minstrels at that
great festival, the mountain seemed to send forth responsive strains
from its echoing caves; and covered all over with Vidy&aacute;dharas
moving about intoxicated with the liquor of heavenly cordials, it
seemed to be itself reeling with wine; and Indra, in his chariot,
having beheld the splendour of the coronation which has now been
described, felt his pride in his own altogether dashed.</p>
<p>Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having thus obtained his long-desired
inauguration as emperor, thought with yearning of his father. And
having at once taken counsel with Gomukha and his other ministers, the
monarch summoned V&aacute;yupatha and said to him, &ldquo;Go and say to
my father, &lsquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta thinks of you with exceeding
longing,&rsquo; and tell him all that has happened, and bring him here,
and bring his queens and his ministers too, addressing the same
invitation to them.&rdquo; When V&aacute;yupatha heard this, he said
&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and made for Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;
through the air.</p>
<p>And he reached that city in a moment, beheld with fear and
astonishment by the citizens, as he was encircled by seventy million
Vidy&aacute;dharas. And he had an interview with Udayana king of Vatsa,
with his ministers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475"
name="pb475">475</a>]</span>and wives, and the king received him with
appropriate courtesy. And the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince sat down and
asked the king about his health, and said to him, while all present
looked at him with curiosity, &ldquo;Your son Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
having propitiated &#346;iva, and beheld him face to face, and having
obtained from him sciences difficult for his enemies to conquer, has
slain M&aacute;nasavega and Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a in the
southern division of the Vidy&aacute;dhara territory, and conquered
Mandaradeva who was lord in the northern division, and has
obtained<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13558src" href="#xd27e13558" name=
"xd27e13558src">9</a> the high dignity of emperor over all the kings of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas in both divisions, who acknowledge his
authority; and has now gone through his solemn coronation on the
&#7770;ishabha mountain, and is thinking, king, with eager yearning of
you and your queens and ministers. And I have been sent by him, so come
at once; for fortunate are those who live to see their offspring
elevate their race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king of Vatsa heard V&aacute;yupatha say this, being full
of longing for his son, he seemed like a peacock that rejoices when it
hears the roaring of the rain-clouds. So he accepted
V&aacute;yupatha&rsquo;s invitation, and immediately mounted a
palanquin with him, and by the might of his sciences travelled through
the air, accompanied by his wives and ministers, and reached that great
heavenly mountain called &#7770;ishabha. And there he saw his son on a
heavenly throne, in the midst of the Vidy&aacute;dhara kings,
accompanied by many wives; resembling the moon reclining on the top of
the eastern mountain, surrounded by the planetary host, and attended by
a company of many stars. To the king the sight of his son in all this
splendour was a shower of nectar, and when he was bedewed with it, his
heart swelled with joy, and he closely resembled the sea when the moon
rises.</p>
<p>Narav&aacute;hanadatta, for his part, beholding that father of his
after a long separation, rose up hurriedly and eager, and went to meet
him with his train. And then his father embraced him, and folded him to
his bosom, and he went through a second sprinkling,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13568src" href="#xd27e13568" name="xd27e13568src">10</a> being
bathed in a flood of his father&rsquo;s tears of joy. And the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; long embraced her son, and bathed him with
the milk that flowed from her breasts at beholding him, so that he
remembered his childhood. And Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and the rest of his father&rsquo;s
ministers, and his uncle Gop&aacute;laka, beholding him after a long
interval, drank in with thirsty eyes his ambrosial frame, like
partridges; while the king treated them with the honour which they
deserved. And Kalingasen&aacute;, beholding her son-in-law and also her
daughter, felt as if the whole world was too narrow for her,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>much less could her own limbs contain her
swelling heart. And Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and the other
ministers, beholding their sons, Hari&#347;ikha and the others, on whom
celestial powers had been bestowed by the favour of their sovereign,
congratulated them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13573src" href=
"#xd27e13573" name="xd27e13573src">11</a></p>
<p>And queen Madanamanchuk&aacute; wearing heavenly ornaments, with
Ratnaprabh&aacute;, Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, Lalitalochan&aacute;,
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, <span class="corr" id="xd27e13588" title=
"Source: S&aacute;ktiya&#347;as">&#346;aktiya&#347;as</span> and
Bhag&iacute;rathaya&#347;as, and the sister of Ruchiradeva, who bore a
heavenly form, and Vegavat&iacute;, and Ajin&aacute;vat&iacute; with
Gandharvadatt&aacute;, and Prabh&aacute;vat&iacute; and
&Aacute;tmanik&aacute; and V&aacute;yuvegaya&#347;as, and her four
beautiful friends, headed by K&aacute;lik&aacute;, and those five other
heavenly nymphs, of whom Mandaradev&iacute; was the chief,&mdash;all
these wives of the emperor Narav&aacute;hanadatta bowed before the feet
of their father-in-law the king of Vatsa, and also of
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and they in
their delight loaded them with blessings, as was fitting.</p>
<p>And when the king of Vatsa and his wives had occupied seats suited
to their dignity, Narav&aacute;hanadatta ascended his lofty throne. And
the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; was delighted to see those various
new daughters-in-law, and asked their names and lineage. And the king
of Vatsa and his suite, beholding the godlike splendour of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, came to the conclusion that they had not been
born in vain.</p>
<p>And in the midst of this great rejoicing<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13595src" href="#xd27e13595" name="xd27e13595src">12</a> at the
reunion of relations, the brave warder Ruchideva entered and said
&ldquo;The banqueting-hall is ready, so be pleased to come
there.&rdquo; When they heard it, they all went to that splendid
banqueting-hall. It was full of goblets made of various jewels, which
looked like so many expanded lotuses, and strewn with many flowers, so
that it resembled a lotus-bed in a garden; and it was crowded with
ladies with jugs full of intoxicating liquor, who made it flash like
the nectar appearing in the arms of Garu&#7693;a. There they drank wine
that snaps those fetters of shame that bind the ladies of the harem;
wine, the essence of Love&rsquo;s life, the ally of merriment. Their
faces, expanded and red with wine, shone like the lotuses in the lakes,
expanded and red with the rays of the rising sun. And the goblets of
the rosy hue of the lotus, finding themselves surpassed by the lips of
the queens, and seeming terrified at touching them, hid with their hue
the wine.</p>
<p>Then the queens of Narav&aacute;hanadatta began to show signs of
intoxication, with their contracted eye-brows and fiery eyes, and the
period of quarrelling seemed to be setting in;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13606src" href="#xd27e13606" name="xd27e13606src">13</a>
nevertheless they went thence in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477"
href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span>order to the hall<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13611src" href="#xd27e13611" name=
"xd27e13611src">14</a> of feasting, which was attractive with its
various viands provided by the power of magic. It was strewed with
coverlets, abounding in dishes, and hung with curtains and screens,
full of all kinds of delicacies and enjoyments, and it looked like the
dancing-ground of the goddesses of good fortune.</p>
<p>There they took their meal, and the sun having retired to rest with
the twilight on the western mountain, they reposed in sleeping
pavilions. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, dividing himself by his science
into many forms, was present in the pavilions of all the queens. But in
his true personality he enjoyed the society of his beloved
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, who resembled the night in being moon-faced,
having eyes twinkling like stars, and being full of revelry. And the
king of Vatsa too, and his train, spent that night in heavenly
enjoyments, seeming as if they had been born again without changing
their bodies. And in the morning all woke up, and delighted themselves
in the same way with various enjoyments in splendid gardens and
pavilions produced by magic power.</p>
<p>Then, after they had spent many days in various amusements, the king
of Vatsa, wishing to return to his own city, went full of affection to
his son the king of all the Vidy&aacute;dharas, who bowed humbly before
him, and said to him, &ldquo;My son, who, that has sense, can help
appreciating these heavenly enjoyments? But the love of dwelling in
one&rsquo;s mother-country naturally draws every man;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13618src" href="#xd27e13618" name="xd27e13618src">15</a> so I
mean to return to my own city; but do you enjoy this fortune of
Vidy&aacute;dhara royalty, for these regions suit you as being half god
and half man. However, you must summon me again some time, when a
suitable occasion presents itself; for this is the fruit of this birth
of mine, that I behold this beautiful moon of your countenance, full of
nectar worthy of being drunk in with the eyes, and that I have the
delight of seeing your heavenly splendour.</p>
<p>When king Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this sincere speech of his
father the king of Vatsa, he quickly summoned Devam&aacute;ya the
Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, and said to him in a voice half-choked with a
weight of tears, &ldquo;My father is returning to his own capital with
my mothers, and his ministers, and the rest of his train, so send on in
front of him a full thousand <i>bh&aacute;ras</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13625src" href="#xd27e13625" name="xd27e13625src">16</a> of gold
and jewels, and employ a thousand Vidy&aacute;dhara serfs to carry
it.&rdquo; When Devam&aacute;ya had received this order given in kind
tones by his master, he bowed and said, &ldquo;Bestower of honour, I
will go in person with my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href=
"#pb478" name="pb478">478</a>]</span>attendants to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; to perform this duty.&rdquo; Then the
emperor sent V&aacute;yupatha and Devam&aacute;ya to attend on their
journey his father and his followers, whom he honoured with presents of
raiment and ornaments. Then the king of Vatsa and his suite mounted a
heavenly chariot, and he went to his own city, after making his son,
who followed him a long way, turn back. And queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, whose longing regret rose at that moment
with hundred-fold force, turned back her dutiful son with tears, and
looking back at him, with difficulty tore herself away. And
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who, accompanied by his ministers, had followed
his parents and elders, returned to that mountain of &#7770;ishabha
with his eyes blinded with tears. There that emperor remained with his
ministers, Gomukha and the rest, who had grown up with him from his
youth, and with hosts of Vidy&aacute;dhara kings, with his wives, and
with Madanamanchuk&aacute; at his side, in the perpetual enjoyment of
heavenly pleasures, and he was ever free from satiety. <span class=

<p>While Narav&aacute;hanadatta was thus living on that &#7770;ishabha
mountain with his wives and his ministers, and was enjoying the
splendid fortune of emperor over the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
which he had obtained, once on a time spring came to increase his
happiness. After long intermission the light of the moon was
beautifully clear, and the earth, enfolded by the young fresh grass,
shewed its joy by sweating dewy drops, and the forest trees, closely
embraced again and again by the winds of the Malaya mountain, were all
trembling, bristling with thorns, and full of sap.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13650src" href="#xd27e13650" name="xd27e13650src">1</a> The
warder of Cupid, the cuckoo, beholding the stalk of the mango-tree,
with his note seemed to forbid the pride of coy damsels; and rows of
bees fell with a loud hum from the flowery creepers, like showers of
arrows shot from the bow of the great warrior Eros. And
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s ministers, Gomukha and the others,
beholding at that time this activity of Spring, said to
Narav&aacute;hanadatta; &ldquo;See, king, this mountain of
&#7770;ishabha is altogether changed, and is now a mountain of flowers,
since the dense lines of forest with which it is covered, have their
blossoms full-blown with spring. Behold, king, the creepers, which,
with their flowers striking against one another, seem to be playing the
castanets; and with the humming of their bees, to be singing, as they
are swayed to and fro by the wind; while the pollen, that covers them,
makes them appear to be crowned with garlands; and the garden made
ready by spring, in which they are, is like the Court of Cupid. Look at
this mango shoot with its garland of bees; it looks like the bow of the
god of love with loosened string, as he reposes after conquering the
world. So come, let us go and enjoy this festival of spring on the bank
of the river Mand&aacute;kin&iacute; where the gardens are so
splendid.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480"
name="pb480">480</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta had been thus exhorted by his ministers,
he went with the ladies of his harem to the bank of the
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;. And there he diverted himself in a garden
resounding with the song of many birds, adorned with cardamom-trees,
clove-trees, <i>vakulas</i>, <i>a&#347;okas</i>, and
<i>mand&aacute;ras</i>. And he sat down on a broad slab of moonstone,
placing queen Madanamanchuk&aacute; at his left hand, accompanied by
the rest of his harem, and attended by various princes of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, of whom Cha&#7751;&#7693;asinha and Amitagati were
the chief; and while drinking wine and talking on various subjects, the
sovereign, having observed the beauty of the season, said to his
ministers, &ldquo;The southern breeze is gentle and soft to the feel;
the horizon is clear; the gardens in every corner are full of flowers
and fragrant; sweet are the strains of the cuckoo, and the joys of the
banquet of wine; what pleasure is wanting in the spring? Still,
separation from one&rsquo;s beloved is during that season hard to bear.
Even animals<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13665src" href="#xd27e13665"
name="xd27e13665src">2</a> find separation from their mates in the
spring a severe affliction. For instance, behold this hen-cuckoo here
distressed with separation! For she has been long searching for her
beloved, that has disappeared from her gaze, with plaintive cries, and
not being able to find him, she is now cowering on a mango, mute and
like one dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, his minister Gomukha said to him,
&ldquo;It is true, all creatures find separation hard to bear at this
time; and now listen, king; I will tell you in illustration of this
something that happened in &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the devoted couple, &#346;&uacute;rasena and
Sushe&#7751;&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13679src" href=
"#xd27e13679" name="xd27e13679src">3</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In that town there dwelt a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, who
was in the service of the monarch, and lived on the proceeds of a
village. His name was &#346;&uacute;rasena, and he had a wife named
Sushe&#7751;&aacute;, who was a native of M&aacute;lava. She was in
every respect well suited to him, and he loved her more than life. One
day the king summoned him, and he was about to set out for his camp,
when his loving wife said to him, &ldquo;My husband, you ought not to
go off and leave me alone; for I shall not be able to exist here for a
moment without you.&rdquo; When &#346;&uacute;rasena&rsquo;s wife said
this to him, he replied, &ldquo;How can I help going, when the king
summons me? Do you not understand my position, fair one? You see, I am
a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, and a servant, dependent on another for my
subsistence.&rdquo; When his wife heard this, she said to him with
tears in her eyes, &ldquo;If you must of necessity go, I shall manage
to endure it somehow, if you return not one day later than the
commencement of spring.&rdquo; Having heard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>this, he at last said to her, &ldquo;Agreed, my
dear! I will return on the first day of the month Chaitra, even if I
have to leave my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, his wife was at last induced to let him go; and
so &#346;&uacute;rasena went to attend on the king in his camp. And his
wife remained at home, counting the days in eager expectation, looking
for the joyful day on which spring begins, on which her husband was to
return. At last, in the course of time, that day of the spring-festival
arrived, resonant with the songs of cuckoos, that seemed like spells to
summon the god of love. The humming of bees drunk with the fragrance of
flowers, fell on the ear, like the twanging of Cupid&rsquo;s bow as he
strung it.</p>
<p>On that day &#346;&uacute;rasena&rsquo;s wife Sushe&#7751;&aacute;
said to herself, &ldquo;Here is that spring-festival arrived; my
beloved will, without fail, return to-day. So she bathed, and adorned
herself, and worshipped the god of Love, and remained eagerly awaiting
his arrival. But the day came to an end and her husband did not return,
and during the course of that night she was grievously afflicted by
despondency, and said to herself, &ldquo;The hour of my death has come,
but my husband has not returned; for those whose souls are exclusively
devoted to the service of another do not care for their own
families.&rdquo; While she was making these reflections, with her heart
fixed upon her husband, her breath left her body, as if consumed by the
forest-fire of love.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile &#346;&uacute;rasena, eager to behold his wife, and
true to the appointed day, got himself, though with great difficulty,
relieved from attendance on the king, and mounting a swift camel,
accomplished a long journey, and arriving in the last watch of the
night, reached his own house. There he beheld that wife of his lying
dead, with all her ornaments on her, looking like a creeper, with its
flowers full blown, rooted up by the wind. When he saw her, he was
beside himself, and he took her up in his arms, and the bereaved
husband&rsquo;s life immediately left his body in an outburst of
lamentation.</p>
<p>But when their family goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, the
bestower of boons, saw that that couple had met their death in this
way, she restored them to life out of compassion. And after breath had
returned to them, having each had a proof of the other&rsquo;s
affection, they continued inseparable for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, in the season of spring, the fire of separation, fanned
by the wind from the Malaya mountain, is intolerable to all
creatures.&rdquo; When Gomukha had told this tale,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, thinking over it, suddenly became despondent.
The fact is, in magnanimous men, the spirits, by being elevated or
depressed, indicate beforehand the approach of good or evil
fortune.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13695src" href="#xd27e13695" name=
"xd27e13695src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href=
"#pb482" name="pb482">482</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the day came to an end, and the sovereign performed his evening
worship, and went to his bedroom, and got into bed, and reposed there.
But in a dream at the end of the night<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13705src" href="#xd27e13705" name="xd27e13705src">5</a> he saw
his father being dragged away by a black female towards the southern
quarter. The moment he had seen this, he woke up, and suspecting that
some calamity might have befallen his father, he thought upon the
science named Prajnapti, who thereupon presented herself, and he
addressed this question to her<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Tell me, how has my father the king of
Vatsa been going on? For I am alarmed about him on account of a sight
which I saw in an evil dream.&rdquo; When he said this to the science
that had manifested herself in bodily form, she said to him,
&ldquo;Hear what has happened to your father the king of Vatsa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was in Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, he suddenly heard
from a messenger, who had come from Ujjayin&iacute;, that king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena was dead, and the same person told
him that his wife the queen Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute; had burnt herself
with his corpse. This so shocked him, that he fell senseless upon the
ground: and when he recovered consciousness, he wept for a long time,
with queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and his courtiers, for his
father-in-law and mother-in-law who had gone to heaven. But his
ministers roused him by saying to him, &lsquo;In this transient world
what is there that hath permanence? Moreover you ought not to weep for
that king, who has you for a son-in-law, and Gop&aacute;laka for a son,
and whose daughter&rsquo;s son is Narav&aacute;hanadatta.&rsquo; When
he had been thus admonished and roused from his prostration, he gave
the offering of water to his father-in-law and mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that king of Vatsa said, with throat half-choked with
tears, to his afflicted brother-in-law Gop&aacute;laka, who remained at
his side out of affection,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13724src" href=
"#xd27e13724" name="xd27e13724src">6</a> &lsquo;Rise up, go to
Ujjayin&iacute;, and take care of your father&rsquo;s kingdom, for I
have heard from a messenger that the people are expecting
you<span class="corr" id="xd27e13733" title="Source: ?">.</span>&rsquo;
When Gop&aacute;laka heard this, he said, weeping, to the king of
Vatsa, &lsquo;I cannot bear to leave you and my sister, to go to
Ujjayin&iacute;. Moreover, I cannot bring myself to endure the sight of
my native city, now that my father is not in it. So let P&aacute;laka,
my younger brother, be king there with my full consent.&rsquo; When
Gop&aacute;laka had by these words shown his unwillingness to accept
the kingdom, the king of Vatsa sent his commander-in-chief
Ruma&#7751;vat to the city of Ujjayin&iacute;, and had his younger
brother-in-law, named P&aacute;laka, crowned king of it, with his elder
brother&rsquo;s consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And reflecting on the instability of all things, he became
disgusted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name=
"pb483">483</a>]</span>with the objects of sense, and said to
Yangandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and his other ministers, &lsquo;In this
unreal cycle of mundane existence all objects are at the end insipid;
and I have ruled my realm, I have enjoyed pleasures, I have conquered
my enemies; I have seen my son in the possession of paramount sway over
the Vidy&aacute;dharas; and now my allotted time has passed away
together with my connections; and old age has seized me by the hair to
hand me over to death; and wrinkles have invaded my body, as the strong
invade the kingdom of a weakling;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13740src"
href="#xd27e13740" name="xd27e13740src">7</a> so I will go to mount
K&aacute;linjara, and abandoning this perishable body, will there
obtain the imperishable mansion of which they speak.&rsquo; When the
ministers had been thus addressed by the king, they thought over the
matter; and then they all and queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; said to
him with calm equanimity, &lsquo;Let it be, king, as it has pleased
your highness; by your favour we also will try to obtain a high
position in the next world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they had said this to the king, being like-minded with
himself, he formed a deliberate resolution, and said to his elder
brother-in-law Gop&aacute;laka, who was present, &lsquo;I look upon you
and Narav&aacute;hanadatta as equally my sons; so take care of this
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, I give you my kingdom.&rsquo; When the
king of Vatsa said this to Gop&aacute;laka, he replied, <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e13746" title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>My
destination is the same as yours, I cannot bear to leave
you.<span class="corr" id="xd27e13749" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> This he asserted in a persistent manner,
being ardently attached to his sister; whereupon the king of Vatsa said
to him, assuming<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13752src" href=
"#xd27e13752" name="xd27e13752src">8</a> an anger, that he did not
feel, &lsquo;To-day you have become disobedient, so as to affect a
hypocritical conformity to my will; and no wonder, for who cares for
the command of one who is falling from his place of power.&rsquo; When
the king spoke thus roughly to him, Gop&aacute;laka wept, with face
fixed on the ground, and though he had determined to go to the forest,
he turned back for a moment from his intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the king mounted an elephant, and accompanied by the
queens V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, set out
with his ministers. And when he left Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, the
citizens followed him, with their wives, children, and aged sires,
crying aloud and raining a tempest of tears. The king comforted them by
saying to them, &lsquo;Gop&aacute;laka will take care of you,&rsquo;
and so at last he induced them to return, and passed on to mount
K&aacute;linjara. And he reached it, and went up it, and worshipped
&#346;iva, and holding in his hand his lyre Ghoshavat&iacute;, that he
had loved all his life, and accompanied by his queens that were ever at
his side, and Yangandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and his other ministers, he
hurled himself from the cliff. And even as they fell, a fiery chariot
came and caught up the king and his companions, and they went in a
blaze of glory to heaven.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484"
href="#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this from the science, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas! my father!&rdquo; and fell senseless on the
ground. And when he recovered consciousness, he bewailed his father and
mother and his father&rsquo;s ministers, in company with his own
ministers, who had lost their fathers.</p>
<p>But the chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas and Dhanavat&iacute;
admonished him, saying, &ldquo;How is it, king, that you are beside
yourself, though you know the nature of this versatile world that
perishes in a moment, and is like the show of a juggler? And how can
you lament for your parents that are not to be lamented for, as they
have done all they had to do on earth; who have seen you their son sole
emperor over all the Vidy&aacute;dharas?&rdquo; When he had been thus
admonished, he offered water to his parents, and put another question
to that science, &ldquo;Where is my uncle Gop&aacute;laka now? What did
he do?&rdquo; Then that science went on to say to the king,</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the king of Vatsa had gone to the mountain from which he
meant to throw himself, Gop&aacute;laka, having lamented for him and
his sister, and considering all things unstable, remained outside the
city, and summoning his brother P&aacute;laka from Ujjayin&iacute;,
made over to him that kingdom of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; also. And
then, having seen his younger brother established in two kingdoms, he
went to the hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa in the ascetic-grove on the Black
Mountain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13770src" href="#xd27e13770" name=
"xd27e13770src">9</a> bent on abandoning the world. And there your
uncle Gop&aacute;laka now is, clothed with a dress of bark, in the
midst of self-mortifying hermits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard that, he went in a chariot to the
Black Mountain, with his suite, eager to visit that uncle. There he
alighted from the sky, surrounded by Vidy&aacute;dhara princes, and
beheld that hermitage of the hermit Ka&#347;yapa. It seemed to gaze on
him with many roaming black antelope like rolling eyes, and to welcome
him with the songs of its birds. With the lines of smoke ascending into
the sky, where pious men were offering the Agnihotra oblations, it
seemed to point the way to heaven to the hermits. It was full of many
mountain-like huge elephants, and resorted to by troops of
monkeys<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13775src" href="#xd27e13775" name=
"xd27e13775src">10</a>; and so seemed like a strange sort of
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, above ground, and free from darkness.</p>
<p>In the midst of that grove of ascetics, he beheld his uncle
surrounded by hermits, with long matted locks, clothed in the bark of a
tree, looking like an incarnation of patience. And Gop&aacute;laka,
when he saw his sister&rsquo;s son approach, rose up and embraced him,
and pressed him to his bosom with tearful eyes. Then they, both of
them, lamented their lost dear ones with renewed grief; whom will not
the fire of grief torture, when fanned by the blast of a meeting with
relations? When even the animals there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb485" href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>were pained to see
their grief, Ka&#347;yapa and the other hermits came up and consoled
those two. Then that day came to an end, and next morning the emperor
entreated Gop&aacute;laka to come and dwell in his kingdom. But
Gop&aacute;laka said to him, &ldquo;What, my child, do you not suppose
that I have all the happiness I desire by thus seeing you? If you love
me, remain here in this hermitage, during this rainy season, which has
arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta had been thus entreated by his uncle, he
remained in the hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa on the Black Mountain, with
his attendants, for the term mentioned.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now, one day, when Narav&aacute;hanadatta was in the
hall of audience on the Black Mountain, his Commander-in-chief came
before him, and said, &ldquo;Last night, my sovereign, when I was on
the top of my house, looking after my troops, I saw a woman being
carried off through the air by a heavenly being, crying out,
&lsquo;Alas! my husband!&rsquo; and it seemed as if the moon, which is
powerful at that season, had taken her and carried her off, finding
that she robbed it of all its beauty. I exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah villain!
where will you go, thus carrying off the wife of another? In the
kingdom of king Narav&aacute;hanadatta the protector, which is the
territory of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, extending over sixty thousand
<i>yojanas</i>, even animals do not work wickedness, much less other
creatures.&rsquo; When I had said this, I hastened with my attendants
and arrested that swift-footed<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13792src"
href="#xd27e13792" name="xd27e13792src">1</a> one, and brought him down
from the air with the lady: and when we looked at him, after bringing
him down, we found that it was your brother-in-law, the
Vidy&aacute;dhara Ityaka, the brother of your principal queen, born to
Madanavega by queen Kalingasen&aacute;. We said to him, &lsquo;Who is
this lady, and where are you taking her?&rsquo; and then he answered;
&lsquo;This is Suratamanjar&iacute; the daughter of the
Vidy&aacute;dhara chief Matangadeva by Ch&uacute;tamanjar&iacute;. Her
mother promised her to me long ago; and then her father bestowed her on
another, a mere man. So, if I have to-day recovered my own wife, and
carried her off, what harm have I done?&rsquo; When Ityaka had said so
much, he was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I said to Suratamanjar&iacute;, &lsquo;Lady, by whom
were you married, and how did this person get possession of you?&rsquo;
Then she said, &lsquo;There is in Ujjayin&iacute; a fortunate king
named P&aacute;laka, he has a son, a prince named<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13806src" href="#xd27e13806" name="xd27e13806src">2</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>Avantivardhana; by him I was married; and this
night, when I was asleep on the top of the palace, and my husband was
asleep also, I was carried off by this villain.&rsquo; When she said
this, I kept both of them here, the lady and Ityaka, the latter in
fetters; it now remains for your majesty to decide what is to be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the emperor heard this from his Commander-in-chief
Hari&#347;ikha, he went in some perplexity to Gop&aacute;laka, and told
him the story. Gop&aacute;laka said, &ldquo;My dear nephew, I do not
know about this; I know so much, that the lady was lately married to
P&aacute;laka&rsquo;s son; so let the prince be summoned from
Ujjayin&iacute;, together with the minister Bharataroha; then we shall
get at the truth.&rdquo; When the emperor received this advice from his
uncle, he sent the Vidy&aacute;dhara Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha to
P&aacute;laka his younger uncle, and summoned from Ujjayin&iacute; that
prince, his son, and the minister. When they arrived and bowed before
the emperor, he and Gop&aacute;laka received them with love and
courtesy, and questioned them about the matter under consideration.</p>
<p>Then, in the presence of Avantivardhana, who looked like the moon
robbed of the night,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13821src" href=
"#xd27e13821" name="xd27e13821src">3</a> of Suratamanjar&iacute;, her
father, and of Ityaka, of V&aacute;yupatha and his peers, and the
hermit Ka&#347;yapa, and the men-at-arms, Bharataroha began to speak as
follows, &ldquo;Once on a time all the citizens of Ujjayin&iacute; met
together and said to P&aacute;laka the king of that city
&lsquo;To-morrow the festival, called the giving of water, will take
place in this city, and if your majesty has not heard the true account
of the origin of this festival, please listen to it
now.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago your father Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena
propitiated the goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute; with asceticism, in
order to obtain a splendid sword and a wife. She gave him her own
sword, and about a wife said to him, &ldquo;Thou shalt soon slay, my
son, the Asura called Ang&aacute;raka, and obtain his beautiful
daughter Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute; for a wife.&rdquo; When the king had
been favoured with this revelation from the goddess, he remained
thinking on the Asura&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>Now, at this time, everybody that was appointed head police officer
in Ujjayin&iacute;, was at once carried off by some creature at night
and devoured. And this went on night after night. Then
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena roaming leisurely about the city at
night, to investigate the matter for himself, found an adulterer. He
cut off with his sword his oiled and curled head, and no sooner was his
neck severed than a certain R&aacute;kshasa came and laid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name="pb487">487</a>]</span>hold
of him. The king exclaimed, &ldquo;This is the gentleman that comes and
eats the heads of the police at night,&rdquo; and laying hold of that
R&aacute;kshasa by the hair, he prepared to slay him.</p>
<p>Then the R&aacute;kshasa said &ldquo;King, do not slay me under a
false impression! There is another creature in this neighbourhood that
eats the heads of the police.&rdquo; The king said, &ldquo;Tell me! who
is it?&rdquo; and the R&aacute;kshasa continued, &ldquo;There is in
this neighbourhood an Asura of the name of Ang&aacute;raka, whose home
is in P&aacute;t&aacute;la. He it is that eats your police-officers at
the dead of night, O smiter of your foes. Moreover, prince, he carries
off by force the daughters of kings from every quarter, and makes them
attend on his daughter Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute;. If you see him roaming
about in the forest, slay him, and attain your object in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the R&aacute;kshasa had said this, the king let him go, and
returned to his palace. And one day he went out to hunt. And in the
place where he was hunting he saw a monstrous boar, with eyes red with
fury, looking like a piece of the mountain of Antimony fallen from
heaven. The king said to himself, &ldquo;Such a creature cannot be a
real boar, I wonder whether it is the Asura Ang&aacute;raka that has
the power of disguising himself:&rdquo; so he smote the boar with
shafts. But the boar recked not of his shafts, and overturning his
chariot, entered a wide opening in the earth.</p>
<p>But the heroic king entered after him, and did not see that boar,
but saw in front of him a splendid castle. And he sat down on the bank
of a lake, and saw there a maiden with a hundred others attending on
her, looking like an incarnation of Rati. She came up to him and asked
him the reason of his coming there, and having conceived an affection
for him, said to him, looking at him with tearful eyes; &ldquo;Alas!
What a place have you entered! That boar that you saw, was really a
Daitya, Ang&aacute;raka by name, of adamantine frame and vast strength.
At present he has abandoned the form of a boar and is sleeping, as he
is tired, but when the time for taking food comes, he will wake up and
do you a mischief. And I, fair sir, am his daughter,
Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute; by name; and fearing that some misfortune may
befall you, I feel as if my life were in my throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this to the king, he, remembering the boon that the
goddess Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute; had given him, felt that he had now a
good hope of accomplishing his object, and answered her, &ldquo;If you
have any love for me, do this which I tell you: when your father
awakes, go and weep at his side, and when he asks you the reason, say,
fair one, &lsquo;Father, if any one were to kill you in your reckless
daring, what would become of me?&rsquo; If you do this, you will ensure
the happiness of both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this to her, she went, bewildered with love, and
sat down and wept at the side of her father who had woke up; and when
he asked her the cause of her weeping, she told him how she was afraid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>that some one would slay him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13856src" href="#xd27e13856" name="xd27e13856src">5</a> Then
the Daitya said to her, &ldquo;Why, who can slay me who am of
adamantine frame? the only vulnerable and vital point I have is in my
left hand, and that the bow protects.&rdquo; This speech of his was
heard by the king, who was at the time concealed near.</p>
<p>Then the Daitya bathed and proceeded to worship &#346;iva. At that
moment the king appeared with his bow strung, and challenged to mortal
combat the Daitya, who was observing religious silence. The Daitya
lifted up his left hand, his right hand being engaged, and made a sign
to the king to wait a little. That very moment the king smote him in
that hand, which was his vital point, with a well-aimed arrow, and the
Daitya fell on the earth. And just before he expired, he said,
&ldquo;If that man who has thus slain me when thirsty, does not every
year offer water to my <i>manes</i>, his five ministers shall
perish.&rdquo; The Daitya being thus slain, the king took his daughter
Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and returned to this city of
Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that king, your father, had married that queen, he
used every year to have an offering of water made to the <i>manes</i>
of Ang&aacute;raka; and all here celebrate the feast called the giving
of water; and to-day it has come round; so do, king, what your father
did before you.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;When king P&aacute;laka heard this speech of
his subjects&rsquo;, he proceeded to set going in that city the
festival of the giving of water. When the festival had begun, and the
people had their attention occupied by it, and were engaged in
shouting, suddenly an infuriated elephant, that had broken its
fastenings, rushed in among them. That elephant, having got the better
of its driving-hook, and shaken off its driver, roamed about in the
city, and killed very many men in a short time. Though the
elephant-keepers ran forward, accompanied by professional
elephant-drivers, and the citizens also, no man among them was able to
control that elephant. At last, in the course of its wanderings, the
elephant reached the quarter of the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las, and
there came out from it a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la maiden. She
illuminated the ground with the beauty of the lotus that seemed to
cling to her feet, delighted because she surpassed with the loveliness
of her face the moon its enemy.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13877src"
href="#xd27e13877" name="xd27e13877src">6</a> She looked like the night
that gives rest to the eyes of the world, because its attention is
diverted from other objects, and so it remains motionless at that
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13886src" href="#xd27e13886" name=
"xd27e13886src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href=
"#pb489" name="pb489">489</a>]</span></p>
<p>That maiden struck that mighty elephant, that came towards her, with
her hand, on its trunk; and smote it with those sidelong looks askance
of hers. The elephant was fascinated with the touch of her hand and
penetrated with her glance, and remained with head bent down, gazing at
her, and never moved a step.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13895src" href=
"#xd27e13895" name="xd27e13895src">8</a> Then that fair lady made a
swing with her upper garment, which she fastened to its tusks, and
climbed up and got into it, and amused herself with swinging. Then the
elephant, seeing that she felt the heat, went into the shade of a tree;
and the citizens, who were present, seeing this great wonder,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! This is some glorious heavenly maiden, who charms
even animals by her power, which is as transcendent as her
beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the prince Avantivardhana, hearing of it, came
out to see the wonderful sight, and beheld that maiden. As he gazed,
the deer of his heart ran into that net of the hunter Love, and was
entangled by it. She too, when she saw him, her heart being charmed by
his beauty, came down from that swing, which she had put up on the
elephant&rsquo;s tusks, and took her upper garment. Then a driver
mounted the elephant, and she went home, looking at the prince with an
expression of shame and affection.</p>
<p>And Avantivardhana, for his part, the disturbance caused by the
elephant having come to an end, went home to his palace with his bosom
empty, his heart having been stolen from it by her. And when he got
home, he was tortured by no longer seeing that lovely maiden, and
forgetting the feast of the giving of water, which had begun, he said
to his companions, &ldquo;Do you know whose daughter that maiden is,
and what her name is?&rdquo; When his friends heard that, they said to
him, &ldquo;There is a certain M&aacute;tanga<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13913src" href="#xd27e13913" name="xd27e13913src">9</a> in the
quarter of the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las, named Utpalahasta, and she
is his daughter, Suratamanjar&iacute; by name. Her lovely form can give
pleasure to the good<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13916src" href=
"#xd27e13916" name="xd27e13916src">10</a> only by being looked at, like
that of a pictured beauty, but cannot be touched without
pollution.&rdquo; When the prince heard that from his friends, he said
to them, &ldquo;I do not think she can be the daughter of a
M&aacute;tanga, she is certainly some heavenly maiden; for a
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la maiden would never possess such a beautiful
form. Lovely as she is, if she does not become my wife, what is the
profit of my life?&rdquo; So the prince continued to say, and his
ministers could not check him, but he was exceedingly afflicted with
the fire of separation from her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490"
href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then queen Avantivat&iacute; and king P&aacute;laka, his parents,
having heard that, were for a long time quite bewildered. The queen
said, &ldquo;How comes it that our son, though born in a royal family,
has fallen in love with a girl of the lowest<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13922src" href="#xd27e13922" name="xd27e13922src">11</a>
caste?&rdquo; Then king P&aacute;laka said, &ldquo;Since the heart of
our son is thus inclined, it is clear that she is really a girl of
another caste, who for some reason or other has fallen among the
M&aacute;tangas. The minds of the good tell them by inclination or
aversion what to do and what to avoid. In illustration of this, queen,
listen to the following tale, if you have not already heard
it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago king Prasenajit, in a city named
Supratish&#7789;hita, had a very beautiful daughter named
Kurang&iacute;. One day she went out into the garden, and an elephant,
that had broken from its fastenings, charged her, and flung her up on
his tusks litter and all. Her attendants dispersed shrieking, but a
young Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la snatched up a sword and ran towards
the elephant. The brave fellow cut off the trunk of that great elephant
with a sword-stroke, and killed it, and so delivered the princess. Then
her retinue came together again, and she returned to her palace with
her heart captivated by the great courage and striking good looks of
the young Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la. And she remained in a state of
despondency at being separated from him, saying to herself,
&ldquo;Either I must have that man who delivered me from the elephant
for a husband, or I must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, for his part, went home
slowly, and having his mind captivated by the princess, was tortured by
thinking on her. He said to himself, &ldquo;What a vast gulf is fixed
between me, a man of the lowest caste, and that princess! How can a
crow and a female swan ever unite? The idea is so ridiculous that I
cannot mention it or consider it, so, in this difficulty, death is my
only resource.&rdquo; After the young man had gone through these
reflections, he went at night to the cemetery, and bathed, and made a
pyre, and lighting the flame thus prayed to it, &ldquo;O thou purifying
fire, Soul of the Universe, may that princess be my wife hereafter in a
future birth, in virtue of this offering up of myself as a sacrifice to
thee!&rdquo; When he had said this, he prepared to fling himself into
the fire, but the Fire-god, pleased with him, appeared in visible shape
before him, and said to him, &ldquo;Do not act rashly, for she shall be
thy wife, for thou art not a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la by birth, and

<p>&ldquo;There is in this city a distinguished Br&aacute;hman of the
name of Kapila&#347;arman; in his fire-chamber I dwell in visible
bodily shape. One day his maiden daughter came near me, and smitten
with her beauty, I made her my wife, inducing her to forego her
objections by promising her immunity from disgrace. And thou, my son,
wert immediately born to her by virtue of my power, and she thereupon,
out of shame, flung thee away in the open street; there thou wast found
by some Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las and reared on goat&rsquo;s
milk.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13948src" href="#xd27e13948" name=

Br&aacute;hman lady. Therefore thou canst not be deemed impure, as thou
art my son; and thou shalt obtain that princess Kurang&iacute; for a
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the god of fire had said this, he disappeared, and the
M&aacute;tanga&rsquo;s adopted child was delighted, and conceived hope,
and so went home. Then king Prasenajit, having been urged by the god in
a dream, investigated the case, and finding out the truth, gave his
daughter to the son of the Fire-god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, queen, there are always to be found heavenly beings in
disguise upon the earth, and you may be assured Suratamanjar&iacute; is
not a woman of the lowest caste, but a celestial nymph. For such a
pearl, as she is, must belong to some other race than that of the
M&aacute;tangas, and without doubt she was the beloved of my son in a
former birth, and this is proved by his falling in love with her at
first sight.&rdquo; When king P&aacute;laka said this in our presence,
I proceeded to relate the following story about a man of the
fisher-caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the young fisher man who married a
princess.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in R&aacute;jag&#7771;iha a king
named Malayasinha, and he had a daughter named
M&aacute;y&aacute;vat&iacute; of matchless beauty. One day a young man
of the fisher-caste, named Suprah&aacute;ra, who was in the bloom of
youth and good looks, saw her as she was amusing herself in a
spring-garden. The moment he saw her, he was overpowered by love; for
destiny never considers whether a union is possible or impossible. So
he went home, and abandoning his occupation of catching fish, he took
to his bed, and refused to eat, thinking only on the princess.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span>And when persistently questioned, he told his
wish to his mother named Rakshitik&aacute;, and she said to her son,
&ldquo;My son, abandon your despondency, and take food; I will
certainly compass this your end for you by my ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this to him, he was consoled, and cherished hopes, and
took food; and his mother went to the palace of the princess with fish
from the lake.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13985src" href="#xd27e13985"
name="xd27e13985src">14</a> There that fisher-wife was announced by the
maids, and went in, on the pretext of paying her respects, and gave the
princess that present of fish. And in this way she came regularly day
after day, and made the princess a present, and so gained her goodwill,
and made her desirous of speaking. And the pleased princess said to the
fisher-wife, &ldquo;Tell me what you wish me to do; I will do it,
though it be ever so difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the fisher-wife begged that her boldness might be pardoned, and
said in secret to the princess, &ldquo;Royal lady, my son has seen you
in a garden, and is tortured by the thought that he cannot be near you;
and I can only manage to prevent his committing suicide by holding out
hopes to him; so, if you feel any pity for me, restore my son to life
by touching him.&rdquo; When the princess was thus entreated by the
fisher-wife, hesitating between shame and a desire to oblige, after
reflection, she said to her, &ldquo;Bring your son to my palace
secretly at night.&rdquo; When the fisher-wife heard this, she went in
high spirits to her son.</p>
<p>And when night came, she deliberately adorned her son as well as she
could, and brought him to the private apartments of the princess. There
the princess took Suprah&aacute;ra, who had pined for her so long, by
the hand, and affectionately welcomed him, and made him lie down on a
sofa, and comforted him whose limbs were withered by the fire of
separation, by shampooing him with her hand, the touch of which was
cool as sandal-wood. And the fisher-boy was thereby, as it were,
bedewed with nectar, and thinking that after long waiting he had
attained his desire, he took his rest, and was suddenly seized by
sleep. And when he was asleep, the princess escaped, and slept in
another room, having thus pleased the fisher-boy, and having avoided
being disgraced through him.</p>
<p>Then that son of the fisher-folk woke up, owing to the cessation of
the touch of her hand, and not seeing his beloved, who had thus come
within his grasp, and again vanished, like a pot of treasure in the
case of a very poor man, who is despondent for its loss, he was reft of
all hope, and his breath at once left his body. When the princess found
that out, she came there, and blamed herself, and made up her mind to
ascend the funeral pyre with him next morning. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then her father, king Malayasinha, heard of it, and came there, and
finding that she could not be turned from her resolve, he rinsed his
mouth, and spake this speech; &ldquo;If I am really devoted to the
three-eyed god of gods, tell me, ye guardians of the world, what it is
my duty to do.&rdquo; When the king said this, a heavenly voice
answered him, &ldquo;Thy daughter was in a former life the wife of this
son of the fisher-folk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, long ago, there lived in a village, called
N&aacute;gasthala, a virtuous Br&aacute;hman of the name of Baladhara,
the son of Mah&iacute;dhara. When his father had gone to heaven, he was
robbed of his wealth by his relations, and being disgusted with the
world, he went with his wife to the bank of the Ganges. While he was
remaining there without food, in order to abandon the body, he saw some
fishermen eating fish, and his hunger made him long for it in his
heart. So he died with his mind polluted by that desire, but his wife
kept her aspirations pure, and continuing firm in penance, followed him
in death.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14002src" href="#xd27e14002" name=
"xd27e14002src">15</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That very Br&aacute;hman, owing to that pollution of his
desires, has been born in the fisher-caste. But his wife, who remained
firm in her asceticism, has been born as thy daughter, O king. So let
this blameless daughter of thine, by the gift of half her
life,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14007src" href="#xd27e14007" name=
"xd27e14007src">16</a> raise up this dead youth, who was her husband in
a former life. For, owing to the might of her asceticism, this youth,
who was thus purified by the splendour of that holy bathing-place,
shall become thy son-in-law, and a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had been thus addressed by the divine voice, he gave
his daughter in marriage to that youth Suprah&aacute;ra, who recovered
his life by the gift of half hers<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span> And Suprah&aacute;ra became a king by means of
the land, elephants, horses, and jewels, which his father-in-law gave
him, and, having obtained his daughter as a wife, lived the life of a
successful man.</p>

love with a thief.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14024src" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;In this way a connexion in a former birth
usually produces affection in embodied beings; moreover, in
illustration of this truth, listen to the following story about a
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Ayodhy&aacute; there lived of old time a king named
V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu, who always protected his subjects as if they
were his own children. And one day the citizens of his capital came to
him and said, &ldquo;King, some thieves plunder this city every night,
and though we keep awake for the purpose, we cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name=
"pb494">494</a>]</span>detect them.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he
placed scouts in the city at night to keep watch. But they did not
catch the thieves and the mischief did not abate. Accordingly the king
went out himself at night to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>And as he was wandering about in every direction, alone, sword in
hand, he saw a man going along on the top of the rampart; he seemed to
tread lightly out of fear; his eyes rolled rapidly like those of a
crow; and he looked round like a lion, frequently turning his neck. He
was rendered visible by the steel-gleams that flashed from his naked
sword, which seemed like binding ropes sent forth to steal those jewels
which men call stars.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14036src" href=
"#xd27e14036" name="xd27e14036src">18</a> And the king said to himself;
&ldquo;I am quite certain that this man is a thief; no doubt he sallies
out alone and plunders this my city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, the wily monarch went up to the
thief; and the thief said to him with some trepidation, &ldquo;Who are
you, Sir?&rdquo; Then the king said to him, &ldquo;I am a desperate
robber, whose many vices make him hard to keep;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14063src" href="#xd27e14063" name="xd27e14063src">19</a> tell me
in turn, who you are.&rdquo; The thief answered, &ldquo;I am a robber,
that goes out to plunder alone; and I have great wealth; so come to my
house: I will satisfy your longing for riches.&rdquo; When the thief
made him this promise, the king said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and went
with him to his dwelling, which was in an underground excavation. It
was inhabited by beautiful women, it gleamed with many jewels, it was
full of ever new delights, and seemed like the city of the
snakes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14072src" href="#xd27e14072" name=
"xd27e14072src">20</a> Then the thief went into the inner chamber of
his dwelling, and the king remained in the outer room; and while he was
there, a female servant, compassionating him, came and said to him,
&ldquo;What kind of place have you entered? Leave it at once, for this
man is a treacherous assassin, and as he goes on his expeditions alone,
will be sure to murder you, to prevent his secrets being
divulged.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14075src" href=
"#xd27e14075" name="xd27e14075src">21</a> When the king heard that, he
went out at once, and quickly repaired to his palace; and summoning his
commander-in-chief, returned with his troops. And he came and
surrounded the thief&rsquo;s dwelling, and made the bravest men enter
it, and so brought the thief back a prisoner, and carried off all his
wealth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the night had come to an end, the king ordered his execution;
and he was led off to the place of execution through the middle of the
market. And as he was being led along through that part of the town, a
merchant&rsquo;s daughter saw him, and fell in love with him at first
sight, and she immediately said to her father, &ldquo;Know that if this
man, who is being led off to execution preceded by the drum of death,
does not become my husband, I shall die myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her father, seeing that she could not be dissuaded from her
resolution, went and tried to induce the king to spare that
thief&rsquo;s life by offering ten millions of coins. But the king,
instead of sparing the thief&rsquo;s life, ordered him to be
immediately impaled,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14098src" href=
"#xd27e14098" name="xd27e14098src">22</a> and was very angry with the
merchant. Then the merchant&rsquo;s daughter, whose name was
V&aacute;madatt&aacute;, took the corpse of that robber, and out of
love for him entered the fire with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, creatures are completely dependent upon
connexions in previous births, and this being the case, who can avoid a
destiny that is fated to him, and who can prevent such a
destiny&rsquo;s befalling anybody? Therefore, king, it is clear that
this Suratamanjar&iacute; is some excellent being that was the wife of
your son Avantivardhana in a previous birth, and is therefore destined
to be his wife again; otherwise how could such a high-born prince have
formed such an attachment for her, a woman of the M&aacute;tanga caste?
So let this M&aacute;tanga, her father Utpalahasta, be asked to give
the prince his daughter; and let us see what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had said this to king P&aacute;laka, he at once sent
messengers to Utpalahasta to ask for his daughter. And the
M&aacute;tanga, when entreated by those messengers to give her in
marriage, answered them, &ldquo;I approve of this alliance, but I must
give my daughter Suratamanjar&iacute; to the man who makes eighteen
thousand of the Br&aacute;hmans, that dwell in this city, eat in my
house.&rdquo; When the messengers heard this speech of the
M&aacute;tanga&rsquo;s, that contained a solemn promise, they went back
and reported it faithfully to king P&aacute;laka.</p>
<p>Thinking that there was some reason for this,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14113src" href="#xd27e14113" name="xd27e14113src">23</a> the king
called together all the Br&aacute;hmans in the city of Ujjayin&iacute;,
and telling them the whole story, said to them, &ldquo;So you must eat
here in the house of the M&aacute;tanga Utpalahasta, eighteen thousand
of you; I will not have it otherwise.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hmans
had been thus commanded by the king, being at the same time afraid of
touching the food of a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, and therefore at a
loss what to do, they went to the shrine of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la and
performed self-torture. Then the god &#346;iva, who was present there
in the form of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, commanded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>those Br&aacute;hmans in a dream, saying,
&ldquo;Eat food here in the house of the M&aacute;tanga Utpalahasta,
for he is a Vidy&aacute;dhara; neither he nor his family are
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las.&rdquo; Then those Br&aacute;hmans rose up
and went to the king, and told him the dream, and went on to say,
&ldquo;So let this Utpalahasta cook pure food for us in some place
outside the quarter of the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las, and then we
will eat it at his hands.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he had
another house made for Utpalahasta, and being highly delighted, he had
food cooked for him there by pure cooks: and then eighteen thousand
Br&aacute;hmans ate there, while Utpalahasta stood in front of them,
bathed, and clothed in a pure garment.</p>
<p>And after they had eaten, Utpalahasta came to king P&aacute;laka, in
the presence of his subjects, and bowing before him, said to him,
&ldquo;There was an influential prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a; I was a dependent of his, named
Matangadeva; and when, king, that daughter of mine Suratamanjar&iacute;
had been born, Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a secretly said to me,
&lsquo;The gods assert that this son of the king of Vatsa, who is
called Narav&aacute;hanadatta, is to be our emperor: so go quickly, and
kill that foe of ours by means of your magic power, before be has
attained the dignity of emperor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the wicked Gaur&iacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;a had sent me on
this errand, I went to execute it, and while going along through the
air, I saw &#346;iva in front of me. The god, being displeased, made an
angry roar, and immediately pronounced on me this curse, &lsquo;How is
it, villain, that thou dost plot evil against a noble-minded man? So
go, wicked one, and fall with this same body of thine into the midst of
the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las in Ujjayin&iacute;, together with thy
wife and daughter. And when some one shall make eighteen thousand of
the Br&aacute;hmans, that dwell in that city, eat in thy house by way
of a gift to purchase thy daughter; then thy curse shall come to an
end, and thou must marry thy daughter to the man who bestows on thee
that gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When &#346;iva had said this, he disappeared, and I, that
very Matangadeva, assuming the name of Utpalahasta, fell among men of
the lowest caste, but I do not mix with them. However, my curse is now
at an end, owing to the favour of your son, so I give him my daughter
Suratamanjar&iacute;. And now I will go to my own dwelling-place among
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, in order to pay my respects to the emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta.&rdquo; When Matangadeva had said this, he
solemnly gave the prince his daughter, and flying up into the air with
his wife, repaired, king, to thy feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And king P&aacute;laka, having thus ascertained the truth,
celebrated with great delight the marriage of Suratamanjar&iacute; and
his son. And his son Avantivardhana, having obtained that
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; for a wife, felt himself fortunate in having
gained more than he had ever hoped for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, one day, that prince went to sleep on the top of the
palace with her and at the end of the night he woke up, and suddenly
discovered that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href="#pb497"
name="pb497">497</a>]</span>his beloved was nowhere to be seen. He
looked for her, but could not find her anywhere, and then he lamented,
and was so much afflicted that his father the king came, and was
exceedingly discomposed. We all, being assembled there at that time,
said, &lsquo;This city is well-guarded, no stranger could enter it
during the night; no doubt she must have been carried off by some
evilly disposed wanderer of the air;&rsquo; and even while we were
saying that, your servant the Vidy&aacute;dhara Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha
descended from the sky. He brought here this prince Avantivardhana, and
king P&aacute;laka also was asked to part with me, in order that I
might state the facts of the case. Here too is Suratamanjar&iacute;
with her father, and the facts concerning her are such as I have said:
your Majesty is the best judge of what ought to be done now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bharataroha the minister of P&aacute;laka had told this tale,
he stopped speaking; and the assessors put this question to Matangadeva
in the presence of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, &ldquo;Tell us, to whom did
you give this daughter of yours Suratamanjar&iacute;?&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;I gave her to Avantivardhana.&rdquo; Then they put
this question to Ityaka, &ldquo;Now do you tell us why you carried her
off?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Her mother promised her to me
originally.&rdquo; The assessors said to Ityaka, &ldquo;While the
father is alive, what authority has the mother? Moreover, where is your
witness to prove the fact of the mother having promised her to you? So
she is with regard to you the wife of another, villain!&rdquo; When
Ityaka was thus put to silence by the assessors, the emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, being angry with him, ordered his immediate
execution on the ground of his misconduct. But the good hermits, with
Ka&#347;yapa at their head, came and entreated him, saying,
&ldquo;Forgive now this one fault of his: for he is the son of
Madanavega, and therefore your brother-in-law.&rdquo; So the king was
at last induced to spare his life, and let him off with a severe
reprimand.</p>
<p>And he reunited that son of his maternal uncle, Avantivardhana, to
his wife, and sent them off with their ministers to their own city, in
the care of V&aacute;yupatha.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Narav&aacute;hanadatta on the Black Mountain had
thus taken away the virtuous Suratamanjar&iacute; from his
brother-in-law Ityaka, who had carried her off, and had reprimanded
him, and had given her back to her husband, and was sitting in the
midst of the hermits, the sage Ka&#347;yapa came and said to him,
&ldquo;There never was, king, and there never will be an emperor like
you, since you do not allow passion and other feelings of the kind to
influence your mind, when you are sitting on the seat of judgment.
Fortunate are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=
"pb498">498</a>]</span>they who ever behold such a righteous lord as
you are; for, though your empire is such as it is, no fault can be
found with you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were in former days &#7770;ishabha and other emperors;
and they, being seized with various faults, were ruined and fell from
their high estate. &#7770;ishabha, and Sarvadamana, and the third
Bandhuj&iacute;vaka, all these, through excessive pride, were punished
by Indra. And the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, when the sage N&aacute;rada came and
asked him the reason of his obtaining the rank of emperor, told him how
he gave away the wishing-tree and his own body,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14147src" href="#xd27e14147" name="xd27e14147src">1</a> and thus
he fell from his high position by revealing his own virtuous deeds. And
the sovereign named Vi&#347;v&aacute;ntara, who was emperor here, he
too, when his son Ind&iacute;var&aacute;ksha had been slain by
Vasantatilaka, the king of Chedi, for seducing his wife, being wanting
in self-control, died on account of the distracting sorrow which he
felt for the death of his wicked son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka alone, who was by birth a mighty
human king, and obtained by his virtuous deeds the imperial sovereignty
over the Vidy&aacute;dharas, long enjoyed the high fortune of empire
without falling into sin, and at last abandoned it of his own accord,
out of distaste for all worldly pleasures, and went to the forest. Thus
in old times did most of the Vidy&aacute;dhara emperors, puffed up with
the attainment of their high rank, abandon the right path, and fall,
blinded with passion. So you must always be on your guard against
slipping from the path of virtue, and you must take care that your
Vidy&aacute;dhara subjects do not swerve from righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit Ka&#347;yapa said this to Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
the latter approved his speech, and said to him with deferential
courtesy, &ldquo;How did T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, being a man, obtain
in old time the sway over the Vidy&aacute;dharas? Tell me, reverend
Sir.&rdquo; When Ka&#347;yapa heard this, he said, &ldquo;Listen, I
will tell you his story.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived among the &#346;ivis<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14164src" href="#xd27e14164" name="xd27e14164src">2</a> a king of
the name of Chandr&aacute;valoka; that sovereign had a head-wife named
Chandralekh&aacute;. Her race was as spotless as the sea of milk, she
was pure herself, and in character like the Ganges. And he had a great
elephant that trampled the armies of his enemies, known on the earth as
Kuvalayap&iacute;&#7693;a. Owing to the might of that elephant, the
king was never conquered by any enemy in his realm, in which the real
power was in the hands of the subjects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb499" href="#pb499" name="pb499">499</a>]</span></p>
<p>And when his youth came to an end, that king had a son, with
auspicious marks, born to him by his queen Chandralekh&aacute;. He gave
the son the name of T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, and he gradually grew up,
and his inborn virtues of liberality, self-control, and discernment
grew with him. And the mighty-minded youth learnt the meaning of all
words except one; but he was so liberal to suppliants that he cannot be
said ever to have learnt the meaning of the word &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Gradually he became old in actions, though young in years; and though
like the sun in fire of valour, he was exceedingly pleasing to look
at;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14178src" href="#xd27e14178" name=
"xd27e14178src">3</a> like the full moon, he became beautiful by the
possession of all noble parts; like the god of Love, he excited the
longing of the whole world; in obedience to his father he came to
surpass J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, and he was distinctly marked
with the signs of a great emperor.</p>
<p>Then his father, the king Chandr&aacute;valoka, brought for that son
of his the daughter of the king of the Madras, named
M&aacute;dr&iacute;. And when he was married, his father, pleased with
the supereminence of his virtues, at once appointed him Crown-prince.
And when T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka had been appointed Crown-prince, he
had made, with his father&rsquo;s permission, alms-houses for the
distribution of food and other necessaries. And every day, the moment
he got up, he mounted the elephant Kuvalayap&iacute;&#7693;a, and went
round to inspect those alms-houses.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14189src" href="#xd27e14189" name="xd27e14189src">4</a> To
whosoever asked anything he was ready to give it, even if it were his
own life: in this way the fame of that Crown-prince spread in every
quarter.</p>
<p>Then he had two twin sons born to him by M&aacute;dr&iacute;, and
the father called them R&aacute;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a. And the boys
grew like the love and joy of their parents, and they were dearer than
life to their grandparents. And T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka and
M&aacute;dr&iacute; were never tired of looking at them, as they bent
before them, being filled with virtue, like two bows of the prince,
being strung.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14206src" href="#xd27e14206"
name="xd27e14206src">5</a></p>
<p>Then the enemies of T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, seeing his elephant
Kuvalayap&iacute;&#7693;a, his two sons, and his reputation for
generosity, said to their Br&aacute;hmans, &ldquo;Go and ask
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka to give you his elephant
Kuvalayap&iacute;&#7693;a. If he gives it you, we shall be able to take
from him his kingdom, as he will be deprived of that bulwark; if he
refuses to give it, his reputation for generosity will be at an
end.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hmans had been thus entreated, they
consented, and asked T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, that hero of generosity,
for that elephant. T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka said to himself,
&ldquo;What do Br&aacute;hmans mean by asking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name="pb500">500</a>]</span>for
a mighty elephant? So I know for certain that they have been put up to
asking me by some one. Happen what will, I must give them my splendid
elephant, for how can I let a suppliant go away without obtaining his
desire, while I live?&rdquo; After going through these reflections,
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka gave the elephant to those Br&aacute;hmans
with unwavering mind.</p>
<p>Then Chandr&aacute;valoka&rsquo;s subjects, seeing that splendid
elephant being led away by those Br&aacute;hmans, went in a rage to the
king, and said, &ldquo;Your son has now abandoned this kingdom, and
surrendering all his rights has taken upon him the vow of a hermit. For
observe, he has given to some suppliants this great elephant
Kuvalayap&iacute;&#7693;a, the foundation of the kingdom&rsquo;s
prosperity, that scatters with its mere smell all other elephants. So
you must either send your son to the forest to practise asceticism, or
take back the elephant, or else we will set up another king in your
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14218src" href="#xd27e14218"
name="xd27e14218src">6</a></p>
<p>When Chandr&aacute;valoka had been thus addressed by the citizens,
he sent his son a message in accordance with their demands through the
warder. When his son T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka heard that, he said,
&ldquo;As for the elephant, I have given it away, and it is my
principle to refuse nothing to suppliants; but what do I care for such
a throne as this, which is under the thumb of the subjects, or for a
royal dignity which does not benefit others,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14226src" href="#xd27e14226" name="xd27e14226src">7</a> and
anyhow is transient as the lightning? So it is better for me to live in
the forest, among trees which give the fortune of their fruits to be
enjoyed by all, and not here among such beasts of men as these subjects
are.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14241src" href="#xd27e14241"
name="xd27e14241src">8</a> When T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka had said this,
he assumed the dress of bark, and after kissing the feet of his parents
and giving away all his wealth to suppliants, he went out from his own
city, accompanied by his wife, who was firm in the same resolution as
himself, and his two children, comforting, as well as he could, the
weeping Br&aacute;hmans. Even beasts and birds, when they saw him
setting forth, wept so piteously that the earth was bedewed with their
rain of tears.</p>
<p>Then T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka went on his way, with no possessions
but a chariot and horses for the conveyance of his children; but some
other Br&aacute;hmans asked him for the horses belonging to the
chariot; he gave them to them immediately, and drew the chariot
himself, with the assistance of his wife <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb501" href="#pb501" name="pb501">501</a>]</span>to convey those
tender young sons to the forest. Then, as he was wearied out in the
middle of the forest, another Br&aacute;hman came up to him, and asked
him for his horseless chariot. He gave it to him without the slightest
hesitation, and the resolute fellow, going along on his feet, with his
wife and sons, at last with difficulty reached the grove of
mortification. There he took up his abode at the foot of a tree, and
lived with deer for his only retinue, nobly waited on by his wife
M&aacute;dr&iacute;. And the forest regions ministered to the heroic
prince, while living in this kingdom of devotion; their clusters of
flowers waving in the wind were his beautiful <i>chowries</i>,
broad-shaded trees were his umbrellas, leaves his bed, rocks his
thrones, bees his singing-women, and various fruits his savoury
viands.</p>
<p>Now, one day, his wife M&aacute;dr&iacute; left the hermitage to
gather fruits and flowers for him with her own hands, and a certain old
Br&aacute;hman came and asked T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, who was in his
hut, for his sons R&aacute;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a.
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka said to himself, &ldquo;I shall be better able
to endure letting these sons of mine, though they are quite infants, be
led away,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14253src" href="#xd27e14253" name=
"xd27e14253src">9</a> than I could possibly manage to endure the
sending a suppliant away disappointed: the fact is, cunning fate is
eager to see my resolution give way&rdquo;: then he gave those sons to
the Br&aacute;hman. And when the Br&aacute;hman tried to take them
away, they refused to go; then he tied their hands and beat them with
creepers; and as the cruel man took them away, they kept crying for
their mother, and turning round and looking at their father with
tearful eyes. Even when T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka saw that, he was
unmoved, but the whole world of animate and inanimate existences was
moved at his fortitude.</p>
<p>Then the virtuous M&aacute;dr&iacute; slowly returned tired from a
remote part of the forest to her husband&rsquo;s hermitage, bringing
with her flowers, fruits and roots. And she saw her husband, who had
his face sadly fixed on the ground, but she could not see anywhere
those sons of hers, though their toys, in the form of horses, chariots,
and elephants of clay, were scattered about. Her heart foreboded
calamity, and she said excitedly to her husband &ldquo;Alas! I am
ruined! Where are my little sons?&rdquo; Her husband slowly answered
her, &ldquo;Blameless one, I gave those two little sons away to a poor
Br&aacute;hman, who asked for them.&rdquo; When the good lady heard
that, she rose superior to her distraction, and said to her husband,
&ldquo;Then you did well: how could you allow a suppliant to go away
disappointed?&rdquo; When she said this, the equally matched goodness
of that married couple made the earth tremble, and the throne of Indra
rock.</p>
<p>Then Indra saw by his profound meditation that the world was made to
tremble by virtue of the heroic generosity of M&aacute;dr&iacute; and
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href=
"#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>Then he assumed the form of a
Br&aacute;hman, and went to T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka&rsquo;s hermitage,
to prove him, and asked him for his only wife M&aacute;dr&iacute;. And
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka was preparing to give without hesitation, by
the ceremony of pouring water over the hands,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14266src" href="#xd27e14266" name="xd27e14266src">10</a> that
lady who had been his companion in the wild forest, when Indra, thus
disguised as a Br&aacute;hman, said to him, &ldquo;Royal sage, what
object do you mean to attain by giving away a wife like this?&rdquo;
Then T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka said, &ldquo;I have no object in view,
Br&aacute;hman; so much only do I desire, that I may ever give away to
Br&aacute;hmans even my life.&rdquo; When Indra heard this, he resumed
his proper shape, and said to him, &ldquo;I have made proof of thee,
and I am satisfied with thee; so I say to thee, thou must not again
give away thy wife; and soon thou shalt be made emperor over all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; When the god had said this, he
disappeared.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that old Br&aacute;hman took with him those sons of
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, whom he had received as a
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s fee, and losing his way, arrived, as Fate would
have it, at the city of that king Chandr&aacute;valoka, and proceeded
to sell those princes in the market. Then the citizens recognised those
two boys, and went and informed king Chandr&aacute;valoka, and took
them with the Br&aacute;hman into his presence. The king, when he saw
his grandsons, shed tears, and after he had questioned the
Br&aacute;hman, and had heard the state of the case from him, he was
for a long time divided between joy and grief. Then, perceiving the
exceeding virtue of his son, he at once ceased to care about a kingdom,
though his subjects entreated him to remain, but with his wealth he
bought those two grandsons from the Br&aacute;hman, and taking them
with him, went with his retinue to the hermitage of his son
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka.</p>
<p>There he saw him with matted hair, wearing a dress of bark, looking
like a great tree, the advantages of which are enjoyed by birds coming
from every quarter, for he in like manner had bestowed all he had upon
expectant Br&aacute;hmans.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14276src" href=
"#xd27e14276" name="xd27e14276src">11</a> That son ran towards him,
while still a long way off, and fell at his feet, and his father
bedewed him with tears, and took him up on his lap; and thus gave him a
foretaste of his ascent of the throne, as emperor over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, after the solemn sprinkling with water.</p>
<p>Then the king gave back to T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka his sons
R&aacute;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a, saying that he had purchased them, and
while they were relating to one another their adventures, an elephant
with four tusks and the goddess Lakshm&iacute; descended from heaven.
And when the chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name="pb503">503</a>]</span>had
also descended, Lakshm&iacute;, lotus in hand, said to that
T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, &ldquo;Mount this elephant, and come to the
country of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and there enjoy the imperial
dignity<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14289src" href="#xd27e14289" name=
"xd27e14289src">12</a> earned by your great generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lakshm&iacute; said this, T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, after
bowing at the feet of his father, mounted that celestial elephant, with
her, and his wife, and his sons, in the sight of all the inhabitants of
the hermitage, and surrounded by the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas
went through the air to their domain. There the distinctive sciences of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas repaired to him, and he long enjoyed supreme
sway, but at last becoming disgusted with all worldly pleasures, he
retired to a forest of ascetics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus T&aacute;r&aacute;valoka, though a man, acquired in old
time by his deeds of spotless virtue the sovereignty of all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. But others, after acquiring it, lost it by their
offences: so be on your guard against unrighteous conduct either on
your own part or on that of another.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14298src" href="#xd27e14298" name="xd27e14298src">13</a></p>
<p>When the hermit Ka&#347;yapa had told this story, and had thus
admonished Narav&aacute;hanadatta, that emperor promised to follow his
advice. And he had a royal proclamation made all round the mountain of
&#346;iva, to the following effect, &ldquo;Listen, Vidy&aacute;dharas;
whoever of my subjects after this commits an unrighteous act, will
certainly be put to death by me.&rdquo; The Vidy&aacute;dharas received
his commands with implicit submission, and his glory was widely
diffused on account of his causing Suratamanjar&iacute; to be set at
liberty; and so he lived with his retinue in the hermitage of that
excellent sage, on the Black Mountain,<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Thus Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who had been established in the
position of lord paramount over all the kings of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, remained on that Black Mountain in order to get
through the rainy season, spending the time in the hermitage of that
sage Ka&#347;yapa, and in the society of his maternal uncle
Gop&aacute;laka, who was living the life of an ascetic. He was
accompanied by his ministers, and surrounded by twenty-five of his
wives, and attended by various Vidy&aacute;dhara princes, and he
occupied himself in telling tales. One day, the hermits and his wives
said to him, &ldquo;Tell us now! When M&aacute;nasavega took away queen

at the foot of a tree, and Gomukha, having obtained his opportunity,
said to me, in order to console me, &lsquo;Do not be despondent, my

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this country a city famous over the earth
by the name of V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;, which, like the
body of &#346;iva, is adorned with the Ganges, and bestows
emancipation. With the flags on its temples swayed up and down by the
wind, it seems to be ever saying to men &ldquo;Come hither, and attain
salvation.&rdquo; With the pinnacles of its white palaces it looks like
the plateau of mount Kail&aacute;sa, the habitation of the god with the
moon for a diadem, and it is full of troops of &#346;iva&rsquo;s
devoted servants.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14369src" href=
"#xd27e14369" name="xd27e14369src">4</a></p>
<p>In that city there lived of old time a king named
Brahmadatta,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14374src" href="#xd27e14374"
name="xd27e14374src">5</a> exclusively devoted to &#346;iva, a patron
of Br&aacute;hmans, brave, generous, and compassionate. His commands
passed current through the earth, they stumbled not in rocky defiles,
they were not whelmed in seas, there were no continents which they did
not cross. He had a queen named Somaprabh&aacute;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e14377src" href="#xd27e14377" name="xd27e14377src">6</a> who
was dear and delightful to him as the moonlight to the <i>chakora</i>,
and he was as eager to drink her in with his eyes. And he had a
Br&aacute;hman minister named &#346;ivabh&uacute;ti, equal to
V&#7771;ihaspati in intellect, who had fathomed the meaning of all the
&#346;&aacute;stras.</p>
<p>One night, that king, as he was lying on a bed on the top of a
palace exposed to the rays of the moon, saw a couple of swans crossing
through the air, with bodies of gleaming gold, looking like two golden
lotuses opened in the water of the heavenly Ganges,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e14387src" href="#xd27e14387" name="xd27e14387src">7</a> and
attended by a train of king-geese. When that wonderful pair had passed
from his eyes, the king was for a long time afflicted, and his mind was
full of regret at no longer enjoying <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb507" href="#pb507" name="pb507">507</a>]</span>that sight. He passed
that night without sleeping, and next morning he told his minister
&#346;ivabh&uacute;ti what he had seen, and said to him, &ldquo;So, if
I cannot feast my eyes on those golden swans to my heart&rsquo;s
content, of what profit to me is my kingdom or my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this to his minister &#346;ivabh&uacute;ti, he
answered him, &ldquo;Do not be anxious; there is a means of bringing
about what you desire; listen, king; I will tell you what it is. Owing
to the various influence of actions in a previous birth, various is
this infinite host of sentient beings produced by the Creator in this
versatile world. This world is really fraught with woe, but owing to
delusion there arises in creatures the fancy that happiness is to be
found in it, and they take pleasure in house, and food, and drink, and
so become attached to it. And Providence has appointed that different
kinds of food, drink, and dwellings, should be agreeable to different
creatures, according to the classes to which they respectively belong.
So have made, king, a great lake to be the dwelling-place of these
swans, covered with various kinds of lotuses, and watched by guards,
where they will be free from molestation. And keep always scattering on
the bank food of the kind that birds love, in order that water-birds
may quickly come there from various quarters. Among them these two
golden swans will certainly come; and then you will be able to gaze on
them continually: do not be despondent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When king Brahmadatta&rsquo;s minister said this to him, he had that
great lake made according to his directions, and it was ready in a
moment. The lake was frequented by swans, <i>s&aacute;rasas</i> and
<i>chakrav&aacute;kas</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14402src" href=
"#xd27e14402" name="xd27e14402src">8</a> and after a time that couple
of swans came there, and settled down on a clump of lotuses in it. Then
the guards set to watch the lake came and informed the king of that
fact, and he went down to the lake in a state of great delight,
considering that his object had been accomplished. And he beheld those
golden swans, and worshipped them from a distance, and ministered to
their comfort by scattering for them grains of rice dipped in milk. And
the king took so much interest in them that he spent his whole time on
the bank of that lake watching those swans with their bodies of pure
gold, their eyes of pearl, their beaks and feet of coral, and the tips
of their wings of emerald,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14411src" href=
"#xd27e14411" name="xd27e14411src">9</a> which had come there in
perfect confidence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508"
name="pb508">508</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, one day, as the king was roaming along the bank of the lake, he
saw in one place a pious offering made with unfading flowers. And he
said to the guards there, &ldquo;Who made this offering?&rdquo; Then
the guards of the lake said to the king, &ldquo;Every day, at dawn,
noon, and sunset, these golden swans bathe in the lake, and make these
offerings, and stand absorbed in contemplation: so we cannot say, king,
what is the meaning of this great wonder.&rdquo; When the king heard
this from the guards, he said to himself, &ldquo;Such a proceeding is
quite inconsistent with the nature of swans; surely there must be a
reason for this. So, I will perform asceticism until I find out who
these swans are.&rdquo; Then the king and his wife and his minister
gave up food, and remained performing penance and absorbed in
meditation on &#346;iva. And after the king had fasted for twelve days,
the two heavenly swans came to him, and said to him in a dream with
articulate voice, &ldquo;Rise up, king; to-morrow we will tell you and
your wife and minister, after you have broken your fast, the whole
truth of the matter in private.&rdquo; When the swans had said this,
they disappeared, and next morning the king and his wife and his
minister, as soon as they awoke, rose up, and broke their fast. And
after they had eaten, the two swans came to them, as they were sitting
in a pleasure-pavilion near the water. The king received them with
respect, and said to them, &ldquo;Tell me who you are.&rdquo; Then they
proceeded to tell him their history.</p>

<h3 class="main">How P&aacute;rvat&iacute; condemned her five
attendants to be reborn on earth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a monarch of mountains famous on the earth
under the name of Mandara, in whose groves of gleaming jewels all the
gods roam, on whose table-lands, watered with nectar from the churned
sea of milk, are to be found flowers, fruits, roots, and water, that
are antidotes to old age and death. Its highest peaks, composed of
various precious stones, form the pleasure-grounds of &#346;iva, and he
loves it more than mount Kail&aacute;sa.</p>
<p>There, one day, that god left P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, after he had
been diverting himself with her, and disappeared, to execute some
business for the gods. Then the goddess, afflicted by his absence,
roamed in the various places where he loved to amuse himself, and the
other gods did their best to console her.</p>
<p>And one day the goddess was much troubled by the advent of spring,
and she was sitting surrounded by the Ga&#7751;as at the foot of a
tree, thinking about her beloved, when a noble Ga&#7751;a, named
Ma&#7751;ipushpe&#347;vara, looked lovingly at a young maiden, the
daughter of Jay&aacute;, called Chandralekh&aacute;, who was waving a
<i>chowrie</i> over the goddess. He was a match for her in youth and
beauty, and she met his glance with a responsive look of love, as he
stood by her side. Two other Ga&#7751;as, named Pinge&#347;vara and
Guhe&#347;vara, when they saw that, interchanged glances, and a smile
passed over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href="#pb509" name=
"pb509">509</a>]</span>their faces. And when the goddess saw them
smiling, she was angry in her heart, and she cast her eyes hither and
thither, to see what they were laughing at in this unseemly manner. And
then she saw that Chandralekh&aacute; and Ma&#7751;ipushpe&#347;vara
were looking lovingly in one another&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>Then the goddess, who was quite distracted with the sorrow of
separation, was angry, and said, &ldquo;These young people have done
well to look lovingly<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14456src" href=
"#xd27e14456" name="xd27e14456src">10</a> at one another in the absence
of the god, and these two mirthful people have done well to laugh when
they saw their glances: so let this lover and maiden, who are blinded
with passion, fall into a human birth; and there the disrespectful pair
shall be man and wife; but these unseasonable laughers shall endure
many miseries on the earth; they shall be first poor Br&aacute;hmans,
and then<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14459src" href="#xd27e14459" name=
"xd27e14459src">11</a> Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasas, and then
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, and after that Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las, and
then robbers, and then bob-tailed dogs, and then they shall be various
kinds of birds,&mdash;shall these Ga&#7751;as who offended by laughing;
for their minds were unclouded, when they were guilty of this
disrespectful conduct.</p>
<p>When the goddess had uttered this command, a Ga&#7751;a of the name
of Dh&uacute;rja&#7789;a said, &ldquo;Goddess, this is very unjust;
these excellent Ga&#7751;as do not deserve so severe a curse, for a
very small offence.&rdquo; When the goddess heard that, she said in her
wrath to Dh&uacute;rja&#7789;a also, &ldquo;Fall thou also, great sir,
that knowest not thy place, into a mortal womb.&rdquo; When the goddess
had inflicted these tremendous curses, the female warder Jay&aacute;,
the mother of Chandralekh&aacute;, clung to her feet, and addressed
this petition to her, &ldquo;Withdraw thy anger, goddess; appoint an
end to the curse of this daughter of mine, and of these thy own
servants, that have through ignorance committed sin.&rdquo; When
P&aacute;rvat&iacute; had been thus entreated by her warder
Jay&aacute;, she said, &ldquo;When all these, owing to their having
obtained insight, shall in course of time meet together, they shall,
after visiting &#346;iva the lord of magic powers, in the
place<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14470src" href="#xd27e14470" name=
"xd27e14470src">12</a> where Brahm&aacute; and the other gods performed
asceticism, return to our court, having been freed from their curse.
And this Chandralekh&aacute;, and her beloved, and that
Dh&uacute;rja&#7789;a shall, all three of them, be happy in their life
as mortals, but these two shall be miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the goddess had said this, she ceased; and at that very moment
the Asura Andhaka came there, having heard of the absence of &#346;iva.
The presumptuous Asura hoped to win the goddess, but having been
reproached by her attendants he departed, but he was slain on that
account by the god, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb510" href="#pb510"

and pursued him.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14480src" href=
"#xd27e14480" name="xd27e14480src">13</a> Then &#346;iva returned home
having accomplished his object, and P&aacute;rvat&iacute; delighted
told him of the coming of Andhaka, and the god said to her, &ldquo;I
have to-day slain a former mind-born son of thine, named Andhaka, and
he shall now be a Bh&#7771;ingin here, as nothing remains of him but
skin and bone.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had said this, he remained there
diverting himself with the goddess, and Ma&#7751;ipushpe&#347;vara and
the other five descended to earth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on the earth a royal grant to
Br&aacute;hmans, named Yajnasthala. In it there lived a rich<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e14502src" href="#xd27e14502" name=
"xd27e14502src">14</a> and virtuous Br&aacute;hman named Yajnasoma. In
his middle age he had two sons born to him; the name of the elder was
Harisoma and of the younger Devasoma. They passed through the age of
childhood, and were invested with the sacred thread, and then the
Br&aacute;hman their father lost his wealth, and he and his wife
died.</p>
<p>Then those <span class="corr" id="xd27e14516" title=
"Source: three">two</span> wretched sons, bereaved of their father, and
without subsistence, having had their grant taken from them by their
relations, said to one another, &ldquo;We are now reduced to living on
alms, but we get no alms here. So we had better go to the house of our
maternal grandfather, though it is far off. Though we have come down in
the world, who on earth would welcome us, if we arrive of our own
accord. Nevertheless let us go. What else indeed are we to do, for we
have no other resource?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After deliberating to this effect they went, begging their way, by
slow stages, to that royal grant, where the house of their grandfather
was. There the unfortunate young men found out, by questioning people,
that their grandfather, whose name was Somadeva, was dead, and his wife
also.</p>
<p>Then, begrimed with dust, they entered despairing the house of their
maternal uncles named Yajnadeva and Kratudeva. There those good
Br&aacute;hmans welcomed them kindly, and gave them food and clothing,
and they remained engaged in study. But in course of time the wealth of
their maternal uncles diminished, and they could keep no servants, and
then they came and said to those nephews in the most affectionate way,
&ldquo;Dear boys, we can no longer afford to keep a man to look after
our cattle, as we have become poor, so do you look after our cattle for
us.&rdquo; When Harisoma and Devasoma&rsquo;s uncles said this to them,
their throats were full <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb511" href=
"#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>of tears, but they agreed to their
proposal. Then they took the cattle to the forest every day, and looked
after them there, and at evening they returned home with them, wearied
out.</p>
<p>Then, as they went on looking after the cattle, owing to their
falling asleep in the day, some animals were stolen, and others were
eaten by tigers. That made their uncles very unhappy: and one day a cow
and goat intended for sacrifice, belonging to their uncles, both
disappeared somewhere or other. Terrified at that, they took the other
animals home before the right time, and running off in search of the
two that were missing, they entered a distant forest. There they saw
their goat half eaten by a tiger, and after lamenting, being quite
despondent, they said, &ldquo;Our uncles were keeping this goat for a
sacrifice, and now that it is destroyed, their anger will be something
tremendous. So let us dress its flesh with fire, and eat enough of it
to put an end to our hunger, and then let us take the rest, and go off
somewhere and support ourselves by begging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these reflections they proceeded to roast the goat, and while
they were so engaged, their two uncles arrived, who had been running
after them, and saw them cooking the goat. When they saw their uncles
in the distance, they were terrified, and they rose up in great
trepidation, and fled from the spot. And those two uncles in their
wrath pronounced<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14529src" href=
"#xd27e14529" name="xd27e14529src">15</a> on them the following curse,
&ldquo;Since, in your longing for flesh, you have done a deed worthy of
R&aacute;kshasas, you shall become flesh-eating
Br&aacute;hman-Rakshasas.&rdquo; And immediately those two young
Br&aacute;hmans became Brahman-R&aacute;kshasas, having mouths
formidable with tusks, flaming hair, and insatiable hunger; and they
wandered about in the forest catching animals and eating them.</p>
<p>But one day they rushed upon an ascetic, who possessed supernatural
power, to slay him, and he in self-defence cursed them, and they became
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas. And in their condition as Pi&#347;&aacute;chas,
they were carrying off the cow of a Br&aacute;hman, to kill it, but
they were overpowered by his spells, and reduced by his curse to the
condition of Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las.</p>
<p>One day, as they were roaming about in their condition as
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las, bow in hand, tormented with hunger, they
reached, in their search for food, a village of bandits. The warders of
the village, supposing them to be thieves, arrested them both, as soon
as they saw them, and cut off their ears and noses. And they bound
them, and beat them with sticks, and brought them in this condition
before the chiefs of the bandits. There they were questioned by the
chiefs, and being bewildered with fear, and tormented with hunger and
pain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14539src" href="#xd27e14539" name=
"xd27e14539src">16</a> they related their history to them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512" name="pb512">512</a>]</span>Then
the chiefs of the gang, moved by pity, set them at liberty, and said to
them, &ldquo;Remain here and take food; do not be terrified. You have
arrived here on the eighth day of the month, the day on which we
worship K&aacute;rtikeya, and so you are our guests; and should have a
share in our feast.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14547src" href=
"#xd27e14547" name="xd27e14547src">17</a> &ldquo;When the bandits had
said this, they worshipped the goddess Durg&aacute;, and made the two
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;las eat in their presence,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e14552src" href="#xd27e14552" name="xd27e14552src">18</a> and
having, as it happened, taken a fancy to them, they would not let them
out of their sight. Then they lived with those bandits by robbing, and
thanks to their courage, became eventually the chiefs of the gang.</p>
<p>And one night those chiefs marched with their followers to plunder a
large town, a favourite abode of &#346;iva, which some of their spies
had selected for attack. Though they saw an evil omen, they did not
turn back, and they reached and plundered the whole city and the temple
of the god. Then the inhabitants cried to the god for protection, and
&#346;iva in his wrath bewildered the bandits by making them blind. And
the citizens suddenly perceiving that, and thinking that it was due to
the favour of &#346;iva, assembled and smote those bandits with sticks
and stones. And Ga&#7751;as, moving about invisibly, flung some of the
bandits into ravines, and dashed others to pieces against the
ground.</p>
<p>And the people, seeing the two leaders, were about to put them to
death, but they immediately turned into bob-tailed dogs. And in this
transformation they suddenly remembered their former birth, and danced
in front of &#346;iva, and fled to him for protection. When the
citizens, Br&aacute;hmans, merchants, and all, saw that, they were
delighted at being free from fear of robbers, and went laughing to
their houses. And then the delusion, that had possessed those two
beings now turned into dogs, disappeared, and they awoke to reality,
and in order to put an end to their curse, they fasted, and appealed to
&#346;iva by severe asceticism. And the next morning, the citizens,
making high festival and worshipping &#346;iva, beheld those dogs
absorbed in contemplation, and though they offered them food, the
creatures would not touch it.</p>
<p>And the two dogs remained in this state for several days, beheld by
all the world, and then &#346;iva&rsquo;s Ga&#7751;as preferred this
prayer to him, &ldquo;O god, these two Ga&#7751;as, Pinge&#347;vara and
Guhe&#347;vara, who were cursed by the goddess, have been afflicted for
a long time, so take pity on them.&rdquo; When the holy god heard that,
he said, &ldquo;Let these two Ga&#7751;as be delivered from their
canine condition and became crows!&rdquo; Then they became crows, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name=
"pb513">513</a>]</span>broke their fast upon the rice of the offering,
and lived happily, remembering their former state, exclusively devoted
to &#346;iva.</p>
<p>After some time, &#346;iva having been satisfied by their devotion
to him, they became by his command first vultures, and then peacocks;
then those noble Ga&#7751;as, in course of time, became swans; and in
that condition also they strove with the utmost devotion to propitiate
&#346;iva. And at last they gained the favour of that god by bathing in
sacred waters, by performing vows, by meditations, and acts of worship,
and they became all composed of gold and jewels, and attained
supernatural insight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know that we are those very two, Pinge&#347;vara and
Guhe&#347;vara, who by the curse of P&aacute;rvat&iacute; endured a
succession of woes, and have now become swans. But the Ga&#7751;a
Ma&#7751;ipushpe&#347;vara, who was in love with the daughter of
Jay&aacute;, and was cursed by the goddess, has become a king upon
earth, even yourself, Brahmadatta. And that daughter of Jay&aacute; has
been born as this lady, your wife Somaprabh&aacute;; and that
Dh&uacute;rja&#7789;a has been born as this your minister
&#346;ivabh&uacute;ti. And therefore we, having attained insight, and
remembering the end of the curse appointed by P&aacute;rvat&iacute;,
appeared to you at night. By means of that artifice we have all been
re-united here to-day; and we will bestow on you the perfection of
insight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us go to that holy place of &#346;iva on the
Trida&#347;a mountain, rightly named Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e14573src" href="#xd27e14573" name=
"xd27e14573src">19</a> where the gods performed asceticism in order to
bring about the destruction of the Asura Vidyuddhvaja. And they slew
that Asura in fight, with the help of Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, the head
of all the Vidy&aacute;dhara princes, who had been obtained by the
favour of &#346;iva. And that Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, having passed
through the state of humanity brought upon him by a curse, obtained
reunion with Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; by the favour of the same god. Let
us go to that holy place, which has such splendid associations
connected with it, and there propitiate &#346;iva, and then we will
return to our own home, for such was the end of the curse appointed to
all of us by the goddess, to take place at the same time.&rdquo; When
the two heavenly swans said this to king Brahmadatta, he was at once
excited with curiosity to hear the tale of Mukt&aacute;phalaketu.</p>

Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time there was a king of the Daityas named
Vidyutprabh&aacute;, hard for gods to conquer. He, desiring a son, went
to the bank of the Ganges, and with his wife performed asceticism for a
hundred years to propitiate Brahm&aacute;. And by the favour of
Brahm&aacute;, who was pleased with his asceticism, that enemy of the
gods obtained a son named Vidyuddhvaja, who was invulnerable at their
hands.</p>
<p>That son of the king of the Daityas, even when a child, was of great
valour; and one day seeing that their town was guarded on all sides by
troops, he said to one of his companions, &ldquo;Tell me, my friend,
what have we to be afraid of, that this town is thus guarded on all
sides by troops?&rdquo; Then his companion said to him, &ldquo;We have
an adversary in Indra the king of the gods; and it is on his account
that this system of guarding the town is kept up. Ten hundred thousand
elephants, and fourteen hundred thousand chariots, and thirty hundred
thousand horsemen, and a hundred millions of footmen guard the city in
turn for one watch of the night, and the turn of guarding comes round
for every division in seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Vidyuddhvaja heard this, he said, &ldquo;Out on such a throne,
that is guarded by the arms of others, and not by its own might!
However, I will perform such severe asceticism, as will enable me to
conquer my enemy with my own arm, and put an end to all this insolence
of his.&rdquo; When Vidyuddhvaja had said this, he put aside that
companion of his, who tried to prevent him, and without telling his
parents, went to the forest to perform penance.</p>
<p>But his parents heard of it, and in their affection for their child,
they followed him, and said to him, &ldquo;Do not act rashly, son;
severe asceticism ill befits a child like you. Our throne has been
victorious over its enemies; is there one more powerful in the whole
world? What do you desire to get by withering yourself in vain? Why do
you afflict us?&rdquo; When Vidyuddhvaja&rsquo;s parents said this to
him, he answered them, &ldquo;I will acquire, even in my childhood,
heavenly arms by the force of asceticism; as for our empire over the
world being unopposed by enemies, do I not know so much from the fact
that our city is guarded by troops ever ready in their
harness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Asura Vidyuddhvaja, firm in his resolution, had said so
much to his parents, and had sent them away, he performed asceticism to
win over Brahm&aacute;. He continued for a period of three hundred
years living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515" name=
"pb515">515</a>]</span>on fruits only, and successively for similar
periods living on water, air, and nothing at all. Then Brahm&aacute;,
seeing that his asceticism was becoming capable of upsetting the system
of the world, came to him, and at his request gave him the weapons of
Brahm&aacute;. He said, &ldquo;This weapon of Brahm&aacute; cannot be
repelled by any weapon except the weapon of Pa&#347;upati Rudra, which
is unattainable by me. So, if you desire victory, you must not employ
it unseasonably.&rdquo; When Brahm&aacute; had said this, he went away,
and that Daitya went home.</p>
<p>Then Vidyuddhvaja marched out to conquer his enemies with his
father, and with all his forces, who came together to that great feast
of war. Indra, the ruler of the gods&rsquo; world, heard of his coming,
and kept guard in heaven, and when he drew near, marched out to meet
him, eager for battle, accompanied by his friend Chandraketu, the king
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and by the supreme lord of the Gandharvas,
named Padma&#347;ekhara. Then Vidyuddhvaja appeared, hiding the heaven
with his forces, and Rudra and others came there to behold that battle.
Then there took place between those two armies a battle, which was
involved in darkness<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14615src" href=
"#xd27e14615" name="xd27e14615src">2</a> by the sun&rsquo;s being
eclipsed with the clashing together of missiles; and the sea of war
swelled high, lashed by the wind of wrath, with hundreds of chariots
for inflowing streams, and rolling horses and elephants for marine
monsters.</p>
<p>Then single combats took place between the gods and Asuras, and
Vidyutprabh&aacute;, the father of Vidyuddhvaja, rushed in wrath upon
Indra. Indra found himself being gradually worsted by the Daitya in the
interchange of missiles; so he flung his thunderbolt at him. And then
that Daitya, smitten by the thunderbolt, fell dead. And that enraged
Vidyuddhvaja so that he attacked Indra. And, though his life was not in
danger, he began by discharging at him the weapon of Brahm&aacute;; and
other great Asuras struck at him with other weapons. Then Indra called
to mind the weapon of Pa&#347;upati, presided over by &#346;iva
himself, which immediately presented itself in front of him; he
worshipped it, and discharged it among his foes. That weapon, which was
of the nature of a destroying fire, consumed the army of the Asuras;
but Vidyuddhvaja, being a child, only fell senseless when smitten by
it; for that weapon does not harm children, old men, or fugitives. Then
all the gods returned home victorious.</p>
<p>And Vidyuddhvaja, for his part, who had fallen senseless, recovered
his senses after a very long time, and fled weeping, and then said to
the rest of his soldiers, who had assembled; &ldquo;In spite of my
having acquired the weapon of Brahm&aacute;, we were not victorious
to-day, though victory was in our grasp; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb516" href="#pb516" name="pb516">516</a>]</span>on the contrary we
were defeated. So I will go and attack Indra, and lose my life in
battle. Now that my father is slain, I shall not be able to return to
my own city.&rdquo; When he said this, an old minister of his
father&rsquo;s said to him, &ldquo;The weapon of Brahm&aacute;,
discharged unseasonably, is too languid to contend with other weapons
discharged, for that great weapon was to-day overcome by the weapon of
&#346;iva, which will not brook the presence of others. So you ought
not unseasonably to challenge your victorious enemy, for in this way
you will strengthen him and destroy yourself. The calm and resolute man
preserves his own life, and in due time regains might, and takes
revenge on his enemy, and so wins a reputation esteemed by the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that old minister said this to Vidyuddhvaja, he said to him,
&ldquo;Then go you and take care of my kingdom, but I will go and
propitiate that supreme lord &#346;iva.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, he dismissed his followers, though they were
loth to leave him, and he went with five young Daityas, companions of
equal age, and performed asceticism on the bank of the Ganges, at the
foot of mount Kail&aacute;sa. During the summer he stood in the midst
of five fires, and during the winter in the water, meditating on
&#346;iva; and for a thousand years he lived on fruits only. For a
second thousand years he ate only roots, for a third he subsisted on
water, for a fourth on air, and during the fifth he took no food at
all.</p>
<p>Brahm&aacute; once more came to grant him a boon, but he did not
shew him any respect: on the contrary he said, &ldquo;Depart, I have
tested the efficiency of thy boon.&rdquo; And he remained fasting for
another period of equal duration, and then a great volume of smoke rose
up from his head; and &#346;iva manifested himself to him, and said to
him, &ldquo;Choose a boon.&rdquo; When thus addressed, that Daitya said
to him, &ldquo;May I, Lord, by thy favour slay Indra in fight!&rdquo;
The god answered, &ldquo;Rise up! There is no distinction between the
slain<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14634src" href="#xd27e14634" name=
"xd27e14634src">3</a> and the conquered; so thou shalt conquer Indra
and dwell in his heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the god had said this, he disappeared, and Vidyuddhvaja,
considering that the wish of his heart was attained, broke his fast,
and went to his city. There he was welcomed by the citizens, and met by
that minister of his father&rsquo;s, who had endured suffering for his
sake, and who now made great rejoicing. He then summoned the armies of
the Asuras, and made preparation for battle, and sent an ambassador to
Indra to warn him to hold himself in readiness for fight. And he
marched out, hiding with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href=

clove with the thunderous roar of his host, and so he seemed to be
fulfilling the wish<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14656src" href=
"#xd27e14656" name="xd27e14656src">4</a> of the inhabitants of heaven.
And Indra, for his part, knowing that he had returned from winning a
boon, was troubled, but after taking counsel with the adviser of the
gods,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14662src" href="#xd27e14662" name=
"xd27e14662src">5</a> he summoned his forces.</p>
<p>Then Vidyuddhvaja arrived, and there took place between those two
armies a great battle, in which it was difficult to distinguish between
friend and foe. Those Daityas, who were headed by Sub&aacute;hu, fought
with the wind-gods, and Ping&aacute;ksha and his followers with the
gods of wealth, and Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya and his forces with the gods
of fire, and Ayah&#803;k&aacute;ya and his hosts with the sun-gods, and
Akampana and his warriors with the Siddhas; some other Daityas fought
with the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and the rest with the Gandharvas and their
allies. So a great battle continued between them for twenty days, and
on the twenty-first day the gods were routed in fight by the
Asuras.</p>
<p>And when routed, they fled, and entered heaven: and then Indra
himself issued, mounted on Air&aacute;va&#7751;a. And the forces of the
gods rallied round him, and marched out again, with the leaders of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, headed by Chandraketu. Then a desperate fight took
place, and Asuras and gods<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14671src" href=
"#xd27e14671" name="xd27e14671src">6</a> were being slain in great
numbers, when Vidyuddhvaja attacked Indra, to revenge the slaughter of
his father. The king of the gods cleft over and over again the bow of
that chief of the Asuras, who kept repelling his shafts with answering
shafts. Then Vidyuddhvaja, elated with the boon of &#346;iva, seized
his mace, and rushed furiously on Indra. He leapt up, planting his feet
on the tusks of Air&aacute;va&#7751;a, and climbed up on his forehead,
and killed his driver. And he gave the king of the gods a blow with his
mace, and he quickly returned it with a similar weapon. But when
Vidyuddhvaja struck him a second time with his mace, Indra fell
senseless on to the chariot of the Wind-god. And the Wind-god carried
him away in his chariot out of the fight with the speed of thought; and
Vidyuddhvaja, who sprang after him,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14693src" href="#xd27e14693" name="xd27e14693src">7</a> fell on
the ground.</p>
<p>At that moment a voice came from the air, &ldquo;This is an evil
day, so carry Indra quickly out of the fight.&rdquo; Then the Wind-god
carried off Indra at the utmost speed of his chariot, and Vidyuddhvaja
pursued them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href="#pb518" name=
"pb518">518</a>]</span>mounted on his; and in the meanwhile
Air&aacute;va&#7751;ah, infuriated and unrestrained by the
driver&rsquo;s hook, ran after Indra, trampling and scattering the
forces. And the army of the gods left the field of battle and followed
Indra; and B&#7771;ihaspati carried off his wife &#346;ach&iacute;, who
was much alarmed, to the heaven of Brahm&aacute;. Then Vidyuddhvaja,
having gained the victory, and having found Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;
empty, entered it, accompanied by his shouting troops.</p>
<p>And Indra, having recovered consciousness, and seeing that it was an
evil time, entered that heaven of Brahm&aacute; with all the gods. And
Brahm&aacute; comforted him, saying, &ldquo;Do not grieve; at present
this boon of &#346;iva is predominant; but you will recover your
position.&rdquo; And he gave him, to dwell in, a place of his own,
furnished with all delights, named Sam&aacute;dhisthala, situated in a
region of the world of Brahm&aacute;. There the king of the gods dwelt,
accompanied by &#346;ach&iacute; and Air&aacute;va&#7751;a: and by his
orders the Vidy&aacute;dhara kings went to the heaven of the Wind-god.
And the lords of the Gandharvas went to the inviolable world of the
moon; and others went to other worlds, abandoning severally their own
dwellings. And Vidyuddhvaja, having taken possession of the territory
of the gods with beat of drum, enjoyed sway over heaven,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e14711src" href="#xd27e14711" name=
"xd27e14711src">8</a> as an unlimited monarch.</p>
<p>At this point of the story, Chandraketu the Vidy&aacute;dhara king,
having remained long in the world of the Wind-god, said to himself,
&ldquo;How long am I to remain here, fallen from my high rank? The
asceticism of my enemy Vidyuddhvaja has not even now spent its force;
but I have heard that my friend Padma&#347;ekhara, the king of the
Gandharvas, has gone from the world of the Moon to the city of
&#346;iva to perform asceticism. I do not know as yet, whether
&#346;iva has bestowed a boon on him, or not; when I have discovered
that, I shall know what I myself ought to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was going through these reflections, his friend, the king
of the Gandharvas, came towards him, having obtained a boon. That king
of the Gandharvas, having been welcomed with an embrace by Chandraketu,
and questioned,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14718src" href="#xd27e14718"
name="xd27e14718src">9</a> told him his story, &ldquo;I went to the
city of &#346;iva and propitiated &#346;iva with asceticism; and he
said to me, &lsquo;Go, thou shalt have a noble son; and thou shalt
recover thy kingdom, and obtain a daughter of transcendent beauty,
whose husband shall be the heroic slayer of
Vidyuddhvaja.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14724src" href=
"#xd27e14724" name="xd27e14724src">10</a> Having received this promise
from &#346;iva, I have come here to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Chandraketu had heard this from the king of the Gandharvas he
said, &ldquo;I too must go and propitiate &#346;iva in order to put an
end to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb519" href="#pb519" name=
"pb519">519</a>]</span>sorrow; without propitiating him we cannot
obtain the fulfilment of our desires. &ldquo;When Chandraketu had
formed this resolution, he went with his wife Mukt&aacute;val&iacute;
to the heavenly abode of &#346;iva, to perform asceticism.</p>
<p>And Padma&#347;ekbara told the story of his boon to Indra, and
having conceived a hope of the destruction of his enemy, went to the
world of the moon. Then that king of the gods in Sam&aacute;dhisthala,
having also conceived a hope of the destruction of his enemy, called to
mind the counsellor of the immortals. And he appeared as soon as he was
thought upon, and the god, bowing before him, and honouring him, said
to him, &ldquo;&#346;iva, pleased with the asceticism of
Padma&#347;ekhara, has promised that he shall have a son-in-law who
shall slay Vidyuddhvaja. So we shall eventually see an end put to his
crimes; in the meanwhile I am despondent, dwelling here in misery on
account of my having fallen from my high position. So devise, holy sir,
some expedient that will operate quickly.&rdquo; When the adviser of
the gods heard this speech of Indra&rsquo;s, he said to him; &ldquo;It
is true that that enemy of ours has nearly exhausted his asceticism by
his crimes; so now we have an opportunity of exerting ourselves against
him. Come, then; let us tell Brahm&aacute;; he will point out to us an
expedient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When B&#7771;ihaspati had said this to Indra, he went with him to
Brahm&aacute;, and after worshipping him, he told him what was in his
mind. Then Brahm&aacute; said, &ldquo;Am I not also anxious to bring
about the same end? But &#346;iva alone can remove the calamity that he
has caused. And that god requires a long propitiation:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e14738src" href="#xd27e14738" name=
"xd27e14738src">11</a> so let us go to Vish&#7751;u, who is like-minded
with him; he will devise an expedient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Brahm&aacute; and Indra and B&#7771;ihaspati had deliberated
together to this effect, they ascended a chariot of swans, and went to
&#346;vetadv&iacute;pa;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14747src" href=
"#xd27e14747" name="xd27e14747src">12</a> where all the inhabitants
carried the conch, discus, lotus, and club, and had four arms, being
assimilated to Vish&#7751;u in appearance as they were devoted to him
in heart. There they saw the god in a palace composed of splendid
jewels, reposing on the serpent &#346;esha, having his feet adored by
Lakshm&iacute;. After bowing before him, and having been duly welcomed
by him, and venerated by the divine sages, they took the seats
befitting them. When the holy one asked the gods how they prospered,
they humbly said to him, &ldquo;What prosperity can be ours, O god, as
long as Vidyuddhvaja is alive? For you know all that he has done to us,
and it is on his account that we have come here now: it now rests with
you to determine what further is to be done in this matter.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb520" href="#pb520" name=
"pb520">520</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the gods said this to Vish&#7751;u, he answered them,
&ldquo;Why, do I not know that my regulations are broken by that Asura?
But what the great lord, the slayer of Tripura has done, he alone can
undo: I cannot. And from him must proceed the overthrow of that wicked
Daitya. You must make haste, provided I tell you an expedient; and I
will tell you one; listen! There is a heavenly abode of &#346;iva,
named Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara. There the god &#346;iva is found ever
manifest. And long ago that very god manifested to me and
Praj&aacute;pati<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14753src" href=
"#xd27e14753" name="xd27e14753src">13</a> his form as the
flame-<i>linga</i>, and told me this secret. So come, let us go there
and entreat him with asceticism: he will put an end to this affliction
of the worlds.&rdquo; When the god Vish&#7751;u had uttered this
behest, they all went to <span class="corr" id="xd27e14762" title=
"Source: Siddh&iacute;svara">Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara</span> by means of
two conveyances, the bird Garu&#7693;a and the chariot of swans. That
place is untouched by the calamities of old age, death, and sickness,
and it is the home of unalloyed happiness, and in it beasts, birds, and
trees are all of gold. There they worshipped the <i>linga</i> of
&#346;iva, that exhibits in succession all his forms,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e14768src" href="#xd27e14768" name="xd27e14768src">14</a> and
is in succession of various jewels; and then Vish&#7751;u,
Brahm&aacute;, Indra, and B&#7771;ihaspati, all four, with their minds
devoted to &#346;iva, proceeded to perform a severe course of
asceticism in order to propitiate him.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile &#346;iva, propitiated by the severe asceticism
of Chandraketu, bestowed a boon on that prince of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, &ldquo;Rise up, king, a son shall be born to thee,
who shall be a great hero, and shall slay in fight thy enemy
Vidyuddhvaja; he shall become incarnate among the human race by a
curse, and shall render a service to the gods, and shall recover his
position by virtue of the asceticism of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the
daughter of the king of the Gandharvas: and with her for a wife he
shall be emperor over all the Vidy&aacute;dharas for ten
<i>kalpas</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14782src" href=
"#xd27e14782" name="xd27e14782src">15</a> When the god had granted this
boon, he disappeared, and Chandraketu went back to the world of the
Wind-god with his wife.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile &#346;iva was pleased with the severe asceticism of
Vish&#7751;u and his companions in Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara, and he
appeared to them in the <i>linga</i> and delighted them by the
following speech, &ldquo;Rise up, afflict yourselves no longer; I have
been fully propitiated with self-torture by your partizan Chandraketu,
the prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And he shall have a heroic son,
sprung from a part of me, who shall soon slay in fight that Daitya
Vidyuddhvaja. Then, in order that he may perform another service to the
gods, he shall fall<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14793src" href=
"#xd27e14793" name="xd27e14793src">16</a> by a curse into the world of
men, and the daughter of the Gandharva Padma&#347;ekhara shall deliver
him from that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521" name=
"pb521">521</a>]</span>condition. And he shall rule the
Vidy&aacute;dharas with that lady, who shall be an incarnation of a
portion of Gaur&iacute;, and shall be named Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;,
for his consort, and at last he shall come to me. So bear up for a
little: this desire of yours is already as good as accomplished.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When &#346;iva had said this to Vish&#7751;u and his companions,
he disappeared; then Vish&#7751;u, Brahm&aacute;, Indra and
B&#7771;ihaspati went, in high delight, back to the places from which
they came.</p>
<p>Then Mukt&aacute;val&iacute; the wife of that king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Chandraketu, became pregnant, and in time she
brought forth a son, illuminating the four quarters with his
irresistible splendour,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14809src" href=
"#xd27e14809" name="xd27e14809src">17</a> like the infant sun arisen to
remove the oppression under which those ascetics were groaning. And as
soon as he was born this voice was heard from heaven,
&ldquo;Chandraketu, this son of thine shall slay the Asura
Vidyuddhvaja, and know that he is to be by name Mukt&aacute;phalaketu,
the terror of his foes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the voice had said so much to the delighted Chandraketu, it
ceased; and a rain of flowers fell; and Padma&#347;ekhara, and Indra,
hearing what had taken place, came there, and the other gods, who were
lurking concealed. Conversing to one another of the story of the boon
of &#346;iva, and having rejoiced thereat, they went to their own
abodes. And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu had all the sacraments performed for
him, and gradually grew up; and as he grew, the joy of the gods
increased.</p>
<p>Then, some time after the birth of his son, a daughter was born to
Padma&#347;ekhara, the supreme lord of the Gandharvas. And when she was
born, a voice came from the air, &ldquo;Prince of the Gandharvas, this
daughter of thine Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; shall be the wife of that
king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas who shall be the foe of
Vidyuddhvaja.&rdquo; Then that maiden Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; gradually
grew up, adorned with an overflowing effulgence of beauty, as if with
billowy nectar acquired by her being born in the world of the
moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14819src" href="#xd27e14819" name=
"xd27e14819src">18</a></p>
<p>And that Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, even when a child, was high-minded,
and being always devoted to &#346;iva, he performed asceticism, in the
form of vows, fasts, and other penances. And once on a time, when he
had fasted twelve days, and was absorbed in meditation, the adorable
&#346;iva appeared to him, and said, &ldquo;I am pleased with this
devotion of thine, so by my special favour the weapons, the sciences,
and all the accomplishments shall manifest themselves to thee. And
receive from me this sword named Invincible,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14824src" href="#xd27e14824" name="xd27e14824src">19</a> by means
of which thou shalt hold sovereign sway, unconquered by thy
enemies.&rdquo; When the god had said this, he gave him the sword and
disappeared, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522" href="#pb522" name=
"pb522">522</a>]</span>and that prince at once became possessed of
powerful weapons and great strength and courage.</p>
<p>Now, one day, about this time, that great Asura Vidyuddhvaja, being
established in heaven, was disporting himself in the water of the
heavenly Ganges. He saw the water of that stream flowing along brown
with the pollen of flowers, and remarked that it was pervaded by the
smell of the ichor of elephants, and troubled with waves. Then, puffed
up with pride of his mighty arm, he said to his attendants, &ldquo;Go
and see who is disporting himself in the water above me.<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the Asuras heard that,
they went up the stream, and saw the bull of &#346;iva sporting in the
water with the elephant of Indra. And they came back and said to that
prince of the Daityas, &ldquo;King, the bull of &#346;iva has gone
higher up the stream, and is amusing himself in the water with
Air&aacute;va&#7751;a: so this water is full of his garlands and of the
ichor of Air&aacute;va&#7751;a.&rdquo; When that Asura heard this, he
was wroth, in his arrogance making light of Rudra, and infatuated by
the full ripening of his own evil deeds he said to his followers,
&ldquo;Go and bring that bull and Air&aacute;va&#7751;a here
bound.&rdquo; Those Asuras went there, and tried to capture them, and
thereupon the bull and elephant ran upon them in wrath and slew most of
them. And those who escaped from the slaughter went and told
Vidyuddhvaja; and he was angry, and sent a very great force of Asuras
against those two animals. And those two trampled to death that army,
upon which destruction came as the result of matured crime, and then
the bull returned to &#346;iva, and the elephant to Indra.</p>
<p>Then Indra heard about that proceeding of the Daitya&rsquo;s from
the guards, who followed Air&aacute;va&#7751;a to take care of him, and
he concluded that the time of his enemy&rsquo;s destruction had
arrived, as he had treated with disrespect even the adorable &#346;iva.
He told that to Brahm&aacute;, and then he united himself with the
assembled forces of the gods, and the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and his other
allies; and then he mounted the chief elephant of the gods, and set out
to slay that enemy of his; and on his departure &#346;ach&iacute;
performed for him the usual ceremony to ensure good fortune.</p>

<p class="first">Then Indra reached heaven and surrounded it with his
forces, that were rendered confident by the favour of &#346;iva, and
had gained the suitable opportunity and the requisite strength. When
Vidyuddhvaja saw that, he marched out with his army ready for battle;
but as he marched out evil omens manifested themselves to him;
lightning flashes struck his banners, vultures circled above his head,
the state-umbrellas were broken, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb523" href="#pb523" name="pb523">523</a>]</span>jackals uttered
boding howls.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14846src" href="#xd27e14846"
name="xd27e14846src">1</a> Disregarding these evil omens, nevertheless
that Asura sallied forth; and then there took place a mighty battle
between the gods and the Asuras.</p>
<p>And Indra said to Chandraketu the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
&ldquo;Why has Mukt&aacute;phalaketu not yet come?&rdquo; Then
Chandraketu humbly made answer, &ldquo;When I was marching out I was in
such a hurry that I forgot to tell him; but he is sure to hear of it,
and will certainly follow me quickly.&rdquo; When the king of the gods
heard this, he quickly sent the dexterous charioteer of the Wind-god to
bring the noble Mukt&aacute;phalaketu. And his father Chandraketu sent
with Indra&rsquo;s messenger his own warder, with a force and a
chariot, to summon him.</p>
<p>But Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, hearing that his father had gone to
battle with the Daityas, was eager to set out for that fight with his
followers. Then he mounted his elephant of victory, and his mother
performed for him the ceremony to ensure good fortune, and he set out
from the world of the Wind, bearing the sword of &#346;iva. And when he
had set out, a rain of flowers fell on him from heaven, and the gods
beat their drums, and favouring breezes blew. And then the hosts of the
gods, that had fled and hid themselves out of fear of Vidyuddhvaja,
assembled and surrounded him. As he was marching along with that large
army, he saw in his way a great temple of P&aacute;rvat&iacute; named
Meghavana. His devotion to the goddess would not allow him to pass it
without worshipping<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14882src" href=
"#xd27e14882" name="xd27e14882src">2</a>; so he got down from his
elephant, and taking in his hand heavenly flowers, he proceeded to
adore the goddess.</p>
<p>Now it happened that, at that very time, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; the
daughter of Padma&#347;ekhara the king of the Gandharvas, who had now
grown up, had taken leave of her mother, who was engaged in austerities
to bring good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb524" href="#pb524" name=
"pb524">524</a>]</span>fortune to her husband who had gone to war, and
had come, with her attendant ladies, in a chariot, from the world of
Indra, to that temple of Gaur&iacute;, with the intention of performing
asceticism in order to ensure success to her father in battle, and to
the bridegroom on whom she had set her heart.</p>
<p>On the way one of her ladies said to her, &ldquo;You have not as yet
any chosen lover, who might have gone to the war, and your mother is
engaged in asceticism for the well-being of your father; for whose
sake, my friend, do you, a maiden, seek to perform asceticism?&rdquo;
When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had been thus addressed by her friend on
the way, she answered, &ldquo;My friend, a father is to maidens a
divinity procuring all happiness; moreover there has already been
chosen for me a bridegroom of unequalled excellence. That
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, the son who has been born to the
Vidy&aacute;dhara king, in order that he may slay Vidyuddhvaja, has
been destined for my husband by &#346;iva. This I heard from the mouth
of my father, when questioned by my mother. And that chosen bridegroom
of mine has either gone, or certainly is going to battle: so I am about
to propitiate with asceticism the holy Gaur&iacute;, desiring victory
for my future husband<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14897src" href=
"#xd27e14897" name="xd27e14897src">3</a> as well as for my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess said this, her attendant lady answered her,
&ldquo;Then this exertion on your part, though directed towards an
object still in the future, is right and proper; may your desire be
accomplished!&rdquo; Just as her friend was saying this to her, the
princess reached a large and beautiful lake in the neighbourhood of the
temple of Gaur&iacute;. It was covered all over with bright full-blown
golden lotuses, and they seemed as if they were suffused with the
beauty flowing forth from the lotus of her face. The Gandharva maiden
went down into that lake, and gathered lotuses with which to worship
Ambik&aacute;, and was preparing to bathe, when two
R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s came that way, as all the R&aacute;kshasas were
rushing to the battle between the gods and Asuras, eager for flesh.
They had up-standing hair, yellow as the flames vomited forth from
their mouths terrible with tusks, gigantic bodies black as smoke, and
pendulous breasts and bellies. The moment that those wanderers of the
night saw that Gandharva princess, they swooped down upon her, and
seized her, and carried her up towards the heaven.</p>
<p>But the deity, that presided over her chariot, impeded the flight of
those R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s, and her grieving retinue cried for help;
and while this was going on, Mukt&aacute;phalaketu issued from the
temple of the goddess, having performed his worship; and hearing the
lamentation, he came in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525" href=
"#pb525" name="pb525">525</a>]</span>that direction. When the great
hero beheld Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; gleaming bright in the grasp of
that pair of R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s, looking like a flash of lightning
in the midst of a bank of black clouds, he ran forward and delivered
her, hurling the R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s senseless to earth by a blow
from the flat of his hand. And he looked on that torrent river of the
elixir of beauty, adorned with a waist charming with three wave-like
wrinkles, who seemed to have been composed by the Creator of the
essence of all beauty, when he was full of the wonderful skill he had
acquired by forming the nymphs of heaven. And the moment he looked on
her, his senses were benumbed by love&rsquo;s opiate, though he was
strong of will; and he remained for a moment motionless, as if painted
in a picture.</p>
<p>And Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; too, now that the alarm caused by the
R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s was at an end, at once recovered her spirits,
and looked on the prince, who possessed a form that was a feast to the
eyes of the world, and who was one fitted to madden womankind, and
seemed to have been created by Fate by a blending together in one body
of the moon and the god of Love. Then, her face being cast down with
shame, she said of her own accord to her friend, &ldquo;May good luck
befall him! I will depart hence, from the presence of a strange
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even while she was saying this, Mukt&aacute;phalaketu said to her
friend, &ldquo;What did this young lady say?&rdquo; And she answered,
&ldquo;This lovely maiden bestowed a blessing on you, the saver of her
life, and said to me, &ldquo;Come, let us depart from the presence of a
strange man.&rdquo; When Mukt&aacute;phalaketu heard this, he said to
her with eager excitement, &ldquo;Who is she? Whose daughter is she? To
what man of great merit in a former life is she to be given in
marriage?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14919src" href="#xd27e14919" name=
"xd27e14919src">4</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he addressed this question to the princess&rsquo;s companion,
she answered him, &ldquo;Fair sir, this my friend is the maiden named
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the daughter of Padma&#347;ekhara the king of
the Gandharvas, and &#346;iva has ordained that her husband is to be
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, the son of Chandraketu, the darling of the
world, the ally of Indra, the destined slayer of Vidyuddhvaja. Because
she desires the victory for that future husband of hers and for her
father in the battle now at hand, she has come to this temple of
Gaur&iacute; to perform asceticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the followers of Chandraketu&rsquo;s son heard this, they
delighted the princess by exclaiming, &ldquo;Bravo! here is that future
husband of yours.&rdquo; Then the princess and her lover had their
hearts filled with joy at discovering one another, and they both
thought, &ldquo;It is well that we came here to-day,&rdquo; and they
continued casting loving sidelong timid glances at one another; and
while they were thus engaged, the sound of drums was heard,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526" href="#pb526" name=
"pb526">526</a>]</span>and then a host appeared, and a chariot with the
wind-god,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14932src" href="#xd27e14932" name=
"xd27e14932src">5</a> and the warder of Chandraketu coming quickly.</p>
<p>Then the wind-god and the warder respectfully left the chariot, and
went up to that Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, and said to him, &ldquo;The king
of the gods and your father Chandraketu, who are in the field of
battle, desire your presence: so ascend this chariot, and come
quickly.&rdquo; Then the son of the Vidy&aacute;dhara king, though
fettered by love of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, ascended the chariot with
them, out of regard for the interests of his superiors. And putting on
a heavenly suit of armour<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14940src" href=
"#xd27e14940" name="xd27e14940src">6</a> sent by Indra, he set out
quickly, often turning back his head to look at
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;.</p>
<p>And Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; followed with her eyes, as long as he
was in sight, that hero, who with one blow from the flat of his hand
had slain the two R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s, and with him ever in her
thoughts, she bathed and worshipped &#346;iva and
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, and from that time forth kept performing
asceticism in that very place, to ensure his success.</p>
<p>And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, still thinking on his sight of her, which
was auspicious and portended victory, reached the place where the
battle was going on between the gods and Asuras. And when they saw that
hero arrive well-armed and accompanied by a force, all the great Asuras
rushed to attack him. But the hero cut their heads to pieces with a
rain of arrows, and made with them an offering to the gods of the
cardinal points, by way of inaugurating the feast of battle.</p>
<p>But Vidyuddhvaja, seeing his army being slain by that
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, himself rushed in wrath to attack him. And when
he smote with arrows that Daitya, as he came on, the whole army of the
Asuras rushed upon him from every quarter. When Indra saw that, he at
once attacked the army of the Daityas, with the Siddhas, Gandharvas,
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and gods at his back.</p>
<p>Then a confused battle arose, with dint of arrow, javelin, lance,
mace and axe, costing the lives of countless soldiers; rivers of blood
flowed along, with the bodies of elephants and horses for alligators,
with the pearls from the heads of elephants<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14957src" href="#xd27e14957" name="xd27e14957src">7</a> for
sands, and with the heads of heroes for stones. That feast of battle
delighted the flesh-loving demons, who, drunk with blood instead of
wine, were dancing with the palpitating trunks. The fortune of victory
of the gods and Asuras in that sea of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb527" href="#pb527" name="pb527">527</a>]</span>battle, swayed hither
and thither from time to time, fluctuating like a tide-wave. And in
this way the fight went on for twenty-four days, watched by &#346;iva,
Vish&#7751;u, and Brahm&aacute;, who were present in their
chariots.</p>
<p>And at the end of the twenty-fifth day a series of single combats
was taking place between the principal warriors of both armies along
the greater part of the line of fight. And then a duel began between
the noble Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, and Vidyuddhvaja, the former in a
chariot, the latter on an elephant. Mukt&aacute;phalaketu repelled the
weapon of darkness with the weapon of the sun, the weapon of cold with
the weapon of heat, the rock-weapon with the thunderbolt-weapon, the
serpent-weapon with the weapon of Garu&#7693;a, and then he slew the
elephant-driver of that Asura with one arrow, and his elephant with
another. Then Vidyuddhvaja mounted a chariot, and Mukt&aacute;phalaketu
killed the charioteer and the horses. Then Vidyuddhvaja took refuge in
magic. He ascended into the sky invisible with his whole army, and
rained stones and weapons on all sides of the army of the gods. And as
for the impenetrable net of arrows which <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e14973" title=
"Source: Mukt&aacute;phalakhetu">Mukt&aacute;phalaketu</span> threw
around it, that Daitya consumed it with showers of fire.</p>
<p>Then Mukt&aacute;phalaketu sent against that enemy and his followers
the weapon of Brahm&aacute;, which was capable of destroying the whole
world, after he had pronounced over it the appropriate spells. That
weapon killed the great Asura Vidyuddhvaja and his army, and they fell
down dead from the sky. And the rest, namely, Vidyuddhvaja&rsquo;s son
and his followers, and Vajradansh&#7789;ra and his crew fled in fear to
the bottom of Ras&aacute;tala.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14978src"
href="#xd27e14978" name="xd27e14978src">8</a></p>
<p>And then the gods from heaven exclaimed, &ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo;
and they honoured the noble Mukt&aacute;phalaketu with a rain of
flowers. Then Indra, having recovered his sway, as his enemy was slain,
entered heaven, and there was great rejoicing in the three worlds. And
Praj&aacute;pati<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14983src" href=
"#xd27e14983" name="xd27e14983src">9</a> himself came there, making
&#346;ach&iacute; precede him, and fastened a splendid crest-jewel on
the head of Mukt&aacute;phalaketu. And Indra took the chain from his
own neck, and placed it on the neck of that victorious prince, who had
restored his kingdom to him. And he made him sit on a throne equal in
all respects to his own; and the gods, full<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14986src" href="#xd27e14986" name="xd27e14986src">10</a> of joy,
bestowed upon him various blessings. And Indra sent on his warder to
the city of the Asura Vidyuddhvaja, and took possession of it in
addition to his own city, with the intention of bestowing it on
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, when a fitting time presented itself.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528" href="#pb528" name=
"pb528">528</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Gandharva Padma&#347;ekhara, wishing to bestow
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; on that prince, looked meaningly at the face of
the Disposer. And the Disposer, knowing what was in his heart, said to
that prince of the Gandharvas, &ldquo;There is still a service
remaining to be done, so wait a little.&rdquo; Then there took place
the triumphal feast of Indra, with the songs of H&aacute;h&aacute; and
H&uacute;h&uacute;, and the dances of Rambh&aacute; and others, which
they accompanied with their own voices. And when the Disposer had
witnessed the festive rejoicing, he departed, and Indra honoured the
Lokap&aacute;las and dismissed them to their several stations.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15001src" href="#xd27e15001" name=
"xd27e15001src">11</a> And after honouring that Gandharva monarch
Padma&#347;ekhara and his train, he dismissed them to their own
Gandharva city. And Indra, after treating with the utmost respect the
noble Mukt&aacute;phalaketu and Chandraketu, sent them to their own
Vidy&aacute;dhara city to enjoy themselves. And then
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, having destroyed the plague of the universe,
returned to his palace, accompanied by his father, and followed by many
Vidy&aacute;dhara kings. And on account of the prince having returned
victorious with his father, after a long absence, that city displayed
its joy, being adorned with splendid jewels, and garlanded with flags.
And his father Chandraketu at once bestowed gifts on all his servants
and relations, and kept high festival in the city for the triumph of
his son, showering wealth on it, as a cloud showers water. But
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, though he had gained glory by conquering
Vidyuddhvaja, derived no satisfaction from his enjoyments without
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. However, being comforted in soul by a friend
named Sam&#803;yata, who reminded him of the decree of &#346;iva, and
consoling topics of that kind, he managed, though with difficulty, to
get through those days.</p>

<p class="first">In the meanwhile, that king of the Gandharvas,
Padma&#347;ekhara, re-entered his city, celebrating a splendid triumph;
and hearing from his wife that his daughter Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had
performed asceticism in the temple of Gaur&iacute;, to procure for him
victory, he summoned her. And when his daughter came, emaciated with
asceticism and separation from her lover, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb529" href="#pb529" name="pb529">529</a>]</span>and fell at his feet,
he gave her his blessing, and said to her, &ldquo;Dear girl, for my
sake you have endured great hardship in the form of penance, so obtain
quickly for a husband the noble Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, the son of the
king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, the slayer of Vidyuddhvaja, the
victorious protector of the world, who has been appointed to marry you
by &#346;iva himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When her father said this to her, she remained with face fixed on
the ground, and then her mother <span class="corr" id="xd27e15016"
title="Source: Kuvalay&aacute;vat&iacute;">Kuvalay&aacute;vali</span>
said to him, &ldquo;How, my husband, was so terrible an Asura, that
filled the three worlds with consternation, slain by that prince in
fight?&rdquo; When the king heard that, he described to her the valour
of that prince, and the battle between the gods and Asuras. Then
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s companion, whose name was
Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, described the easy manner in which he slew
the two R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s. Then the king and queen, finding out
that he and their daughter had met and fallen in love, were pleased,
and said, &ldquo;What could those R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s do against
one, who swallowed the whole army of the Asuras, as Agastya swallowed
the sea?&rdquo; Then the fire of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s love
blazed up more violently, being fanned by this description of her
lover&rsquo;s surpassing courage, as by a breeze.</p>
<p>Then the princess left her parents&rsquo; presence, and immediately
ascended in eager longing a jewelled terrace in the women&rsquo;s
apartments, which had pillars of precious stone standing in it, and
lattices of pearl fastened to them, and had placed on its pavement, of
costly mosaic, luxurious couches and splendid thrones, and was rendered
still more delightful by means of the various enjoyments which there
presented themselves as soon as thought of. Even when there, she was
exceedingly tortured with the fire of separation. And she saw from the
top of this terrace a magnificent heavenly garden, planted with trees
and creepers of gold, and full of hundreds of tanks adorned with costly
stone. And when she saw it, she said to herself, &ldquo;Wonderful! This
splendid city of ours is more beautiful even than the world of the moon
in which I was born. And yet I have not explored this city which is the
very crest-jewel of the Him&aacute;layas, in which there is such a
splendid suburban garden excelling Nandana. So I will go into this
lovely shrubbery, cool with the shade of trees, and alleviate a little
the scorching of the fires of separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the young maiden had gone through these reflections, she
dexterously managed to descend slowly from the terrace alone, and
prepared to go to that city garden. And as she could not go on foot,
she was carried there by some birds that were brought to her by her
power, and served as her conveyance. When she reached the garden, she
sat in an arbour formed of plantains growing together, on a carpet of
flowers, with heavenly singing and music sounding in her ears. And even
there she did not obtain relief, and her passion did not abate; on the
contrary, the fire of her love increased still more, as she was
separated from her beloved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href=
"#pb530" name="pb530">530</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then in her longing she was eager to behold that loved one, though
only in a picture, so by her magic power she summoned for herself a
tablet for painting and colour-pencils. And she said to herself,
&ldquo;Considering even the Disposer is unable to create a second like
my beloved, how can I, reed<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15026src" href=
"#xd27e15026" name="xd27e15026src">1</a> in hand, produce a worthy
likeness of him? Nevertheless, I will paint him as well as I can for my
own consolation.&rdquo; After going through these reflections she
proceeded to paint him on a tablet, and while she was thus engaged, her
confidante Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, who had been troubled at not
seeing her, came to that place to look for her. She stood behind the
princess, and saw her languishing alone in the bower of creepers, with
her painting-tablet in her hand. She said to herself, &ldquo;I will
just see now what the princess is doing here alone.&rdquo; So the
princess&rsquo;s confidante remained there concealed.</p>
<p>And then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, with her lotus-like eyes gushing
with tears, began to address in the following words her beloved in the
painting. &ldquo;When thou didst slay the formidable Asuras and deliver
Indra, how comes it that thou dost not deliver me from my woe, though
near me, by speaking to me at any rate? To one whose merits in a former
life are small, even a wishing-tree is ungenerous, even Buddha is
wanting in compassion, and even gold becomes a stone. Thou knowest not
the fever of love, and canst not comprehend my pain; what could the
poor archer Love, whose arrows are but flowers, do against one whom the
Daityas found invincible? But what am I saying? Truly Fate is adverse
to me, for Fate stops my eyes with tears, and will not allow me to
behold thee for long together, even in a picture.&rdquo; When the
princess had said this, she began to weep with teardrops that were so
large that it appeared as if her necklace were broken, and great pearls
were falling from it.</p>
<p>At that moment her friend Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute; advanced towards
her, and the princess concealed the picture and said to her, &ldquo;My
friend, I have not seen you for ever so long; where have you
been?&rdquo; When Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute; heard this, she laughed and
said, &ldquo;I have been wandering about, my friend, for a long time to
look for you; so, why do you hide the picture? I saw a moment ago a
wonderful picture.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15036src" href=
"#xd27e15036" name="xd27e15036src">2</a></p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s friend said this to her, she
seized her hand, and said to her with a face cast down from shame, and
a voice choked with tears, &ldquo;My friend, you knew it all long ago;
why should I try to conceal it?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15044src"
href="#xd27e15044" name="xd27e15044src">3</a> The fact is, that prince,
though on that occasion, in the sacred <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb531" href="#pb531" name="pb531">531</a>]</span>enclosure of
Gaur&iacute;, he delivered me from the terrible fire of the
R&aacute;kshas&iacute;&rsquo;s wrath, plunged me nevertheless in the
fire of love, with its intolerable flame of separation. So I do not
know, where to go, whom to speak to, what to do, or what expedient I
must have recourse to, since my heart is fixed on one hard to
obtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess said this, her friend answered her, &ldquo;My
dear, this attachment of your mind is quite becoming and suitable; your
union would certainly be to the enhancement of one another&rsquo;s
beauty, as the union of the digit of the new moon with the hair of
&#346;iva matted into the form of a diadem. And do not be despondent
about this matter: of a truth he will not be able to live without you;
did you not see that he was affected in the same way as yourself? Even
women, who see you,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15060src" href=
"#xd27e15060" name="xd27e15060src">4</a> are so much in love with your
beauty that they desire to become men; so what man would not be a
suitor for your hand? Much more will he be, who is equal to you in
beauty. Do you suppose that &#346;iva, who declared that you should be
man and wife, can say what is false? However, what afflicted one feels
quite patient about an object much desired, even though it is soon to
be attained? So cheer up! He will soon become your husband. It is not
hard for you to win any husband, but all men must feel that you are a
prize hard to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess&rsquo;s attendant said this to her, she answered
her, &ldquo;My friend, though I know all this, what am I to do? My
heart cannot endure to remain for a moment without that lord of my
life, to whom it is devoted, and Cupid will not bear to be trifled with
any further. For when I think of him, my mind is immediately
refreshed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15071src" href="#xd27e15071"
name="xd27e15071src">5</a> but my limbs burn, and my breath seems to
leave my body with glowing heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as the princess was saying this, she, being soft as a flower,
fell fainting with distraction into the arms of that friend of hers.
Then her weeping friend gradually brought her round by sprinkling her
with water and fanning her with plantain-leaves. Her friend employed
with her the usual remedies of a necklace and bracelet of lotus-fibres,
a moist anointing with sandal-wood unguent, and a bed of lotus-leaves;
but these contracted heat by coming in contact with her body, and
seemed by their heating and withering to feel the same pain as she
felt.</p>
<p>Then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, in her agitation, said to that friend,
&ldquo;Why do you weary yourself in vain? My suffering cannot be
alleviated in this way. It would be a happy thing, if you would take
the only step likely to alleviate it.&rdquo; When she said this in her
pain, her friend answered her, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb532"
href="#pb532" name="pb532">532</a>]</span>&ldquo;What would not I do
for your sake? Tell me, my friend, what that step is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess heard this, she said with difficulty, as if
ashamed, &ldquo;Go, my dear friend, and bring my beloved here quickly;
for in no other way can my suffering be allayed, and my father will not
be angry; on the contrary, as soon as he comes here, he will give me to
him.&rdquo; When her friend heard that, she said to her in a tone of
decision, &ldquo;If it be so, recover your self-command. This is but a
little matter. Here am I, my friend, setting out for Chandrapura the
famous and splendid city of Chandraketu the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, the father of your beloved, to bring your beloved
to you. Be comforted! What is the use of grief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the princess had been thus comforted by
Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, she said, &ldquo;Then rise up, my friend, may
your journey be prosperous! Go at once! And you must say courteously
from me to that heroic lord of my life, who delivered the three worlds,
&lsquo;When you delivered me so triumphantly in that temple of
Gaur&iacute; from the danger of the R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s, how is
that you do not deliver me now, when I am being slain by the god Cupid,
the destroyer of women? Tell me, my lord, what kind of virtue is this
in persons like yourself able to deliver the worlds&mdash;to neglect in
calamity one whom you formerly saved, though she is devoted to
you.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15091src" href="#xd27e15091"
name="xd27e15091src">6</a> This is what you must say, auspicious one,
or something to this effect as your own wisdom may direct.&rdquo; When
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had said this, she sent that friend on her
errand. And she mounted a bird which her magic knowledge brought to
her, to carry her, and set out for that city of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.</p>
<p>And then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, having to a certain extent
recovered her spirits by hope, took the painting-tablet, and entered
the palace of her father. There she went into her own apartment
surrounded by her servants, and bathed and worshipped &#346;iva with
intense devotion, and thus prayed to him, &ldquo;Holy one, without thy
favouring consent no wish, great or small, is fulfilled for any one in
these three worlds. So if thou wilt not give me for a husband that
noble son of the emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, on whom I have set
my heart, I will abandon my body in front of thy image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she addressed this prayer to &#346;iva, her attendants were
filled with grief and astonishment, and said to her, &ldquo;Why do you
speak thus, princess, regardless of your body&rsquo;s weal? Is there
anything in these three worlds difficult for you to obtain? Even Buddha
would forget his self-restraint, if loved by you. So he must be a man
of exceptional merit, whom you thus love.&rdquo; When the princess
heard this, carried away by the thought of his virtues, she said,
&ldquo;How can I help loving him, who is the only refuge of Indra and
the rest of the gods, who alone destroyed the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb533" href="#pb533" name="pb533">533</a>]</span>army
of the Asuras, as the sun destroys the darkness, and who saved my
life?&rdquo; Saying such things, she remained there full of longing,
engaged in conversation about her beloved with her confidential
attendants.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile her friend Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, travelling at
full speed, reached Chandrapura, that city of the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas; which Vi&#347;vakarman made wonderful, and of
unparalleled magnificence, as if dissatisfied with the city of the
gods, though of that also he was the architect. There she searched for
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, but could not find him, and then, riding on her
bird, she went to the garden belonging to that city. She derived much
pleasure from looking at that garden, the magic splendour of which was
inconceivable; the trees of which were of glittering jewels, and had
this peculiarity that one tree produced a great many flowers of
different kinds; which was rendered charming by the blending of the
notes of various birds with the sound of heavenly songs; and which was
full of many slabs of precious stone.</p>
<p>And then, various gardeners, in the form of birds, saw her, and came
up to her, speaking with articulate voice, and addressing her kindly,
and they invited her to sit down on a slab of emerald at the foot of a
<i>p&aacute;rij&aacute;ta</i>-tree, and when she was seated, served her
with appropriate luxuries. And she received that attention gratefully,
and said to herself, &ldquo;Wonderful are the magic splendours of the
princes of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, since they possess such a garden in
which enjoyments present themselves unlooked for, in which the servants
are birds, and the nymphs of heaven keep up a perpetual concert.&rdquo;
When she had said this to herself, she questioned those attendants, and
at last, searching about, she found a thicket of
<i>p&aacute;rij&aacute;ta</i> and other trees of the kind, and in it
she saw Mukt&aacute;phalaketu appearing to be ill,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e15113src" href="#xd27e15113" name="xd27e15113src">7</a> lying
on a bed of flowers sprinkled with sandal-wood juice. And she
recognized him, as she had become acquainted with him in the hermitage
of Gaur&iacute;, and she said to herself, &ldquo;Let me see what his
illness is, that he is lying here concealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Mukt&aacute;phalaketu began to say to his friend
Sam&#803;yataka, who was attempting to restore him with ice, and
sandal-wood, and fanning, &ldquo;Surely this god of love has placed hot
coals in the ice for me, and in the sandal-wood juice a flame of chaff,
and in the air of the fan a fire as of a burning forest, since he
produces a scorching glow on every side of me, who am tortured with
separation. So why, my friend, do you weary yourself in vain? In this
garden, which surpasses Nandana, even the delightful songs and dances
and other sports of heavenly nymphs afflict my soul. And without
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the lotus-faced, the daughter of
Padma&#347;ekhara, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534"
name="pb534">534</a>]</span>this fever produced by the arrows of love
cannot be alleviated. But I do not dare to say this, and I do not find
a refuge in any one; indeed I know only of one expedient for obtaining
her. I will go to the temple of Gaur&iacute;, where I saw my beloved,
and where she tore out my heart with the arrows of her sidelong
glances, and carried it away. There &#346;iva, who is united with the
daughter of the king of mountains, will, when propitiated with penance,
shew me how to become united with my beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince had said this, he was preparing to rise up, and then
Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, being much pleased, shewed herself; and
Sam&#803;yataka, delighted, said to that prince, &ldquo;My friend, you
are in luck; your desire is accomplished. Look! here is that
beloved&rsquo;s female attendant come to you. I beheld her at the side
of the princess in the hermitage of the goddess Ambik&aacute;.&rdquo;
Then the prince, beholding the friend of his beloved, was in a strange
state, a state full of the bursting forth of joy, astonishment, and
longing. And when she came near him, a rain of nectar to his eyes, he
made her sit by his side, and asked her about the health of his
beloved.</p>
<p>Then she gave him this answer, &ldquo;No doubt my friend will be
well enough, when you become her husband; but at present she is
afflicted. For ever since she saw you, and you robbed her of her heart,
she has been despondent, and neither hears nor sees. The maiden has
left off her necklace, and wears a chain of lotus-fibres; and has
abandoned her couch, and rolls on a bed of lotus-leaves. Best of
conquerors, I tell you, her limbs, now white with the sandal-wood juice
which is drying up with their heat, seem laughingly<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e15130src" href="#xd27e15130" name="xd27e15130src">8</a> to
say, &lsquo;That very maiden, who formerly was too bashful to endure
the mention of a lover<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15133src" href=
"#xd27e15133" name="xd27e15133src">9</a>, is now reduced to this sad
condition by being separated from her dear one.&rsquo; And she sends
you this message.&rdquo; Having said so much, Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;
recited the two verses which Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had put into her
mouth.</p>
<p>When Mukt&aacute;phalaketu heard all that, his pain departed, and he
joyfully welcomed Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, and said to her,
&ldquo;This my mind has been irrigated by your speech, as by nectar,
and is refreshed; and I have recovered my spirits, and got rid of my
languor: my good deeds in a former life have to-day borne fruit, in
that that daughter of the Gandharva king is so well-disposed towards
me. But, though I might possibly be able to endure the agony of
separation, how could that lady, whose body is as delicate as a
<i>&#347;ir&iacute;sha</i>-flower, endure it? So I will go to that very
hermitage of Gaur&iacute;; and do you bring your friend there, in order
that we may meet at once. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb535" href=
"#pb535" name="pb535">535</a>]</span>And go quickly, auspicious one,
and comfort your friend, and give her this crest-jewel, which puts a
stop to all grief, which the Self-existent gave me, when pleased with
me. And this necklace, which Indra gave me, is a present for
yourself.&rdquo; When the prince had said this, he gave her the
crest-jewel from his head, and he took the necklace from his neck, and
put it on hers.</p>
<p>Then Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute; was delighted, and she bowed before
him, and set out, mounted on her bird, to find her friend
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, his languor having
been removed by delight, quickly entered his own city with
Sam&#803;yataka.</p>
<p>And Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, when she came into the presence of
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, told her of the love-pain of her beloved, as
she had witnessed it, and repeated to her his speech, sweet and tender
with affection, as she had heard it; and told her of the arrangement to
meet her in the hermitage of Gaur&iacute;, which he had made, and then
gave her the crest-jewel which he had sent, and shewed her the chain
which he had given herself as a present. Then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;
embraced and honoured that friend of hers who had been so successful;
and forgot that pain of the fire of love which had tortured her before,
and she fastened that crest-jewel on her head, as if it were joy, and
began to prepare to go to the wood of Gaur&iacute;.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile it happened that a hermit, of the name of
Tapodhana, came to that grove of Gaur&iacute;, with his pupil, named
D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata. And while there, the hermit said to his pupil
D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata, &ldquo;I will engage in contemplation for a
time in this heavenly garden. You must remain at the gate, and not let
any one in, and after I have finished my contemplation, I will worship
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;.&rdquo; When the hermit had said this, he placed
that pupil at the gate of the garden, and began to engage in
contemplation under a <i>p&aacute;rij&aacute;ta</i>-tree. After he rose
up from his contemplation, he went into the temple to worship
Ambik&aacute;, but he did not tell his pupil, who was at the gate of
the garden.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Mukt&aacute;phalaketu came there adorned, with
Sam&#803;yataka, mounted on a heavenly camel. And as he was about to
enter that garden, that pupil of the hermit forbade him, saying,
&ldquo;Do not do so! My spiritual superior is engaged in contemplation
within.&rdquo; But the prince, longing to see his beloved, said to
himself, &ldquo;The area of this garden is extensive, and it is
possible that she may have arrived and may be somewhere within it,
whereas the hermit is only in one corner of it.&rdquo; So he got out of
sight of that hermit&rsquo;s pupil, and with his friend entered the
garden by flying through the air.</p>
<p>And while he was looking about, the hermit&rsquo;s pupil came in to
see if his spiritual superior had completed his meditation. He could
not see his superior there, but he did see the noble
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb536"
href="#pb536" name="pb536">536</a>]</span>friend, who had entered the
garden by a way by which it was not meant to be entered. Then that
pupil of the hermit cursed the prince in his anger, saying to him,
&ldquo;As you have interrupted the meditation of my spiritual guide,
and driven him away, go with your friend to the world of men on account
of this disrespect.&rdquo; After he had pronounced this curse, he went
in search of his superior. But Mukt&aacute;phalaketu was thrown into
great despondency by this curse having fallen on him like a
thunderbolt, when his desire was on the point of being fulfilled. And
in the meanwhile, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, eager to meet her beloved,
came mounted on a bird, with Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute; and her other
attendants. And when the prince saw that lady, who had come to meet him
of her own accord, but was now separated from him by a curse, he was
reduced to a painful frame of mind in which sorrow and joy were
blended. And at that very moment Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s right
eye throbbed, boding evil fortune, and her heart fluttered. Then the
princess, seeing that her lover was despondent, thought that he might
be annoyed because she had not come before he did, and approached him
with an affectionate manner. Then the prince said to her, &ldquo;My
beloved, our desire, though on the point of fulfilment, has been again
baffled by Fate.&rdquo; She said excitedly, &ldquo;Alas! how
baffled?&rdquo; And then the prince told her how the curse was
pronounced on him.</p>
<p>Then they all went, in their despondency, to entreat the hermit, who
was the spiritual guide of him who inflicted the curse, and was now in
the temple of the goddess, to fix an end to the curse. When the great
hermit, who possessed supernatural insight, saw them approach in humble
guise, he said with a kind manner to Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, &ldquo;You
have been cursed by this fool who acted rashly before he had
reflected;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15170src" href="#xd27e15170"
name="xd27e15170src">10</a> however you have not done me any harm,
since I rose up of myself. And this curse can only be an instrument,
not the real reason of your change; in truth you have in your mortal
condition to do the gods a service. You shall come in the course of
destiny to behold this Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and sick with love, you
shall abandon your mortal body, and be quickly released from your
curse. And you shall recover this lady of your life, wearing the same
body that she wears now; for being a deliverer of the universe, you do
not deserve to lie long under a curse. And the cause of all this that
has befallen you is the slight stain of unrighteousness which attaches
to you, on account of your having slain with that weapon of
Brahm&aacute;, which you employed, old men and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard this, she said, with tears in her
eyes, to that sage, &ldquo;Holy Sir, let me now have the same lot as my
future husband! I shall not be able to live for a moment without
him.&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb537" href="#pb537" name="pb537">537</a>]</span>made this request,
the hermit said to her, &ldquo;This cannot be: do you remain here for
the present engaged in asceticism, in order that he may be quickly
delivered from his curse, and may marry you. And then, as the consort
of that Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, you shall rule the Vidy&aacute;dharas
and Asuras for ten <i>kalpas</i>. And while you are performing
asceticism, this crest-jewel, which be gave you, shall protect you; for
it is of great efficacy, having sprung from the water-pot of the
Disposer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit, possessing divine insight, had said this to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, bending low, addressed
this prayer to him, &ldquo;Holy Sir, may my faith in &#346;iva be
unwavering during my life as a man, and may my mind never be inclined
to any lady but Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;.&rdquo; The hermit replied,
&ldquo;So let it be!&rdquo; and then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, sorely
grieved, pronounced on that pupil, whose fault had entailed these
misfortunes, the following curse, &ldquo;Since you cursed in your folly
my destined husband, you shall be a vehicle for him to ride on in his
human condition, possessing the property of going with a wish and
changing your shape at will.&rdquo; When the pupil had been thus
cursed, he was despondent, and then the hermit Tapodhana disappeared
with him.</p>
<p>Then Mukt&aacute;phalaketu said to Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, &ldquo;I
will now go to my city, and see what will happen to me there.&rdquo;
When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard this, being terrified at separation,
she at once fell on the earth with all her ornaments, as a creeper,
broken by the wind, falls with all its flowers. And
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu comforted, as well as he could, his crying love,
and departed with his friend, frequently turning round his eyes to look
at her. And after he was gone, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; was much
grieved, and weeping, said to her friend Manoh&aacute;rik&aacute;, who
tried to comfort her, &ldquo;My friend, I am certain that I saw the
goddess P&aacute;rvat&iacute; to-day in a dream, and she was about to
throw a garland of lotuses round my neck, when she said, &lsquo;Never
mind! I will give it you on some future occasion,&rsquo; and desisted
from her intention. So I understand that she wished in this way to let
me know that my union with my beloved would be hindered.&rdquo; When
she was mourning in this way over what had occurred, her friend said to
her, &ldquo;This dream was no doubt sent to you when you say, by the
goddess, in order to comfort you. And the hermit said the very same to
you, and the gods have clearly thus ordained: so, be of good cheer, you
will soon be reunited with your beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This and other speeches from her friend, and the magic efficacy of
the crest-jewel made Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; recover her self-command,
and she remained there in the hermitage of Gaur&iacute;. And she
performed asceticism, worshipping there &#346;iva and
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, three times a day, and also the picture of her
beloved, which she had brought from her own city, looking upon it as
the image of a divinity. Her parents, hearing what had taken place,
came to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name=
"pb538">538</a>]</span>her in tears, and tried to prevent her, saying,
&ldquo;Do not uselessly fatigue yourself with penance, to bring about a
desired end, which will anyhow take place.&rdquo; But she said to them,
&ldquo;How could I live here with any comfort, now that the husband
recently appointed for me by the god has fallen into misery owing to a
curse? For to ladies of good family a husband is a god. And no doubt,
this calamity may soon be brought to an end by austerities, and
&#346;iva may be propitiated, and then I may be reunited with my
beloved, for there is nothing<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15194src"
href="#xd27e15194" name="xd27e15194src">11</a> that austerities cannot
accomplish.&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had said this with firm
resolution, her mother Kuvalay&aacute;val&iacute; said to her father
the king, &ldquo;King, let her perform this severe asceticism! Why
trouble her further on false grounds? This is appointed for her by
destiny: there is a reason for it; listen. Long ago, in the city of
&#346;iva, the daughter of the king of the Siddhas, named
Devaprabh&aacute;, was performing a very severe penance, in order to
obtain the husband she desired. Now my daughter Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;
had gone there with me to visit the shrine of the god, and she went up
to the Siddha maiden and laughed at her, saying, &lsquo;Are you not
ashamed to practise austerities in order to obtain a husband?&rsquo;
Then the Siddha maiden cursed her in her rage, saying, &lsquo;Fool!
your laughter proceeds from childishness: you also shall perform
painful austerities to your heart&rsquo;s content to obtain a
husband.&rsquo; Accordingly she must of necessity endure the misery
which the curse of the Siddha maiden has entailed; who can alter that?
So let her do what she is doing?&rdquo; When the queen had said this to
the king of the Gandharvas, he took leave at last, though reluctantly,
of his daughter, who bowed at his feet, and went to his own city. And
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; remained in that hermitage of
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, intent on religious observances and prayers, and
every day she went through the air and worshipped that
Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara, that was worshipped by Brahm&aacute; and the
other gods, of which &#346;iva had told her in a dream.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; was engaged in
asceticism, in order that she might be reunited to
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, the son of the emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, that prince, feeling that his descent into the
world of men was nigh at hand owing to the curse of the Br&aacute;hman,
in his fear, fled to &#346;iva as a refuge. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name="pb539">539</a>]</span></p>
<p>And while he was worshipping &#346;iva, he heard a voice issue from
the inner cell of his temple, &ldquo;Fear not, for thou shalt not have
to endure misery while dwelling in the womb, and thou shalt not have to
suffer during thy life as a mortal, nor shalt thou long remain in that
condition.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15211src" href="#xd27e15211"
name="xd27e15211src">1</a> Thou shalt be born as a strong and valorous
prince. Thou shalt obtain from the hermit Tapodhana the control of all
weapons, and my Ga&#7751;a named Kinkara shall be thy younger brother.
With his help thou shalt conquer thy enemies, and accomplish the
required service for the gods, and thou shalt be reunited with
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; and rule the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; When
that prince had heard this voice, he conceived hope, and remained
waiting for the ripening, so to speak, of the fruit of the curse
pronounced upon him.</p>
<p>At this point of my story there was a city in the eastern region
named Devasabha, that surpassed in splendour the court of the gods. In
it there lived a universal monarch named Merudhvaja, the comrade of
Indra when war arose between the gods and Asuras. That great-hearted
prince was greedy of glory, not of the goods of others; his sword was
sharp, but not his punishments; he feared sin, but not his enemy. His
brows were sometimes curved in anger, but there was no crookedness in
his heart. His arm was hard, where it was marked with the horny
thickening produced by the bowstring, but there was no hardness in his
speech. He spared his helpless enemies in battle, but he did not
exhibit any mean parsimony with regard to his treasure;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15219src" href="#xd27e15219" name=
"xd27e15219src">2</a> and he took pleasure in virtuous deeds and not in
women.</p>
<p>That king had always two anxieties in his heart, the first was that
not even one son was as yet born to him, the second was that the
Asuras, who escaped from the slaughter in the great fight long ago
between the gods and Asuras, and fled to P&aacute;t&aacute;la, kept
continually sallying out to a distance from it, and treacherously
destroying holy places, temples, and hermitages in his land, and then
retiring into P&aacute;t&aacute;la again; and the king could not catch
them, as they could move through the air as well as through
P&aacute;t&aacute;la; that afflicted the brave monarch, though he had
no rivals upon earth.</p>
<p>It happened that once, when he was afflicted with these anxieties,
he went to the assembly of the gods, on the day of the full moon in the
month Chaitra, in Indra&rsquo;s splendid chariot, which he sent to
fetch him; for Indra always held a general assembly in the early part
of that day, and king Merudhvaja always went to it in his chariot. But
on that occasion the king kept sighing, though he was amused with the
dances and songs of the heavenly nymphs, and honoured by Indra.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540" name=
"pb540">540</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the king of the gods saw that, knowing what was in his heart,
he said to him, &ldquo;King, I know what thy grief is; dismiss it from
thy mind. One son shall be born to thee, who shall be called
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, and shall be a portion of &#346;iva, and a
second named Malayadhvaja, who shall be an incarnation of a Ga&#7751;a.
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja and his younger brother shall obtain from the
hermit Tapodhana the sciences and all weapons and a creature to ride
on, that shall possess the power of assuming any shape. And that
invincible warrior shall again obtain the great weapon of
Pa&#347;upati, and shall slay the Asuras, and get into his power the
earth and P&aacute;t&aacute;la. And receive from me these two air-going
elephants K&aacute;nchanagiri and K&aacute;nchana&#347;ekhara, together
with mighty weapons.&rdquo; When Indra had said this to Merudhvaja, he
gave him the arms and the elephants, and dismissed him, and he went
delighted to his own city on the earth. But those Asuras, who had
managed by their treachery to cast discredit upon the king, escaped
being caught by him, even when mounted on the sky-going elephant, for
they took refuge in P&aacute;t&aacute;la.</p>
<p>Then the king, desiring a son, went, on his heavenly elephant, to
the hermitage of that hermit Tapodhana, of whom Indra had told him.
There he approached that hermit, and told him that command of Indra,
and said to him, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, quickly tell me what course I
ought to take to gain my end.&rdquo; And the hermit recommended that
the king and his wife should immediately take upon them a vow for the
propitiation of &#346;iva, in order that they might attain their end.
The king then proceeded to propitiate &#346;iva with that vow, and then
that god, being pleased, said to the king in a dream, &ldquo;Rise up,
king, thou shalt soon<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15240src" href=
"#xd27e15240" name="xd27e15240src">3</a> obtain one after another two
invincible sons for the destruction of the Asuras.&rdquo; When the king
had heard this, he told it to the hermit when he woke up in the
morning, and after he and his wife had broken their fast, he returned
to his own city.</p>
<p>Then that august and beautiful lady, the queen of Merudhvaja, became
pregnant within a few days. And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu was in some
mysterious way conceived in her, having been compelled by the curse to
abandon his Vidy&aacute;dhara body. And that body of his remained in
his own city of Chandrapura, guarded by his relations, kept by magic
from corrupting.</p>
<p>So the queen of king Merudhvaja, in the city of Devasabha, delighted
her husband by becoming pregnant. And the more the queen was oppressed
by her condition, the more sprightly was her husband the king. And when
the time came, she gave birth to a boy resembling the sun, who,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb541" href="#pb541" name=
"pb541">541</a>]</span>though an infant, was of great might, even as
P&aacute;rvat&iacute; gave birth to the god of war. And then not only
did rejoicing take place over the whole earth, but in the heaven also
in which the gods struck their drums. And the hermit Tapodhana, who
possessed heavenly insight, came there in person, to congratulate that
king Merudhvaja. With the help of that hermit, the rejoicing king gave
his son the name Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja mentioned by Indra.</p>
<p>Then the hermit departed; but after the lapse of a year a second son
was born to the king by that queen, and the king, with the help of that
hermit, who, in the same way, came there out of joy, named him
Malayadhvaja.</p>
<p>Then Sam&#803;yataka was born as the son of the king&rsquo;s
minister in accordance with the curse, and his father gave him the name
of Mah&aacute;buddhi. Then those two princes gradually grew up, like
lions&rsquo; whelps, with that minister&rsquo;s son, and as they grew,
their might developed also.</p>
<p>And after eight years only had passed, the hermit Tapodhana came and
invested those princes with the sacred thread. And during eight more
years he instructed them<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15262src" href=
"#xd27e15262" name="xd27e15262src">4</a> in knowledge, and in the
accomplishments, and in the use of all the mighty weapons. Then king
Merudhvaja, seeing that his sons were young men, able to fight with all
weapons, considered that he had not lived in vain.</p>
<p>Then the hermit was about to return to his hermitage, but the king
said to him, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, now take whatever present you
desire.&rdquo; The great sage answered, &ldquo;This is the present I
desire from you, king, that, with your sons, you would slay the Asuras
that impede my sacrifices. The king said to him, &ldquo;Then, reverend
sir, you must now take your present; so begin a sacrifice; the Asuras
will come to impede it, and then I will come with my sons. For formerly
those Daityas, after they had treacherously wrought you wrong, used to
fly up into the air, and dive into the sea, and go to
P&aacute;t&aacute;la. But now I have two air-going elephants given me
by Indra, by means of those two I and my sons will catch them, even if
they do fly through the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit heard that, he was pleased and he said to the king,
&ldquo;Then do you make in the mean time fit preparation for my
sacrifice, in order that I may go and begin a long sacrificial session
that will be famous in every corner of the earth. And I will send you,
as a messenger, this my pupil D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata, who has acquired
the shape of an unrestrained mighty bird going with a wish; and on him
shall Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hermit had said this, he returned to his hermitage, and the
king sent after him the preparations for the sacrifice. With those he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href="#pb542" name=
"pb542">542</a>]</span>began a sacrifice, at which the gods and
<i>&#7771;ishis</i> assembled in a body, and the D&aacute;navas,
dwelling in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, were excited when they heard of
it.</p>
<p>When the hermit knew that, he sent his pupil
D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata, who had been made by the curse to assume the
form of a bird, to the city of Devasabha. When king Merudhvaja saw him
arrive there, he remembered the words of the hermit, and got ready
those two heavenly elephants. And he himself mounted the chief one,
which was named K&aacute;nchanagiri, and the lesser one, which was
named K&aacute;nchana&#347;ekhara, he gave to the younger of his sons.
But Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, taking with him the heavenly weapons,
mounted the great bird D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata, and the bards hailed
him with songs. Then those three heroes sent their armies on in front,
and set forth, mounted on air-going steeds, and blessed by holy
Br&aacute;hmans. And when they reached the hermitage, the hermit, being
pleased with them, granted them this boon, that they should be
invulnerable by all weapons.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the army of the Asuras came to impede the
sacrifice, and the soldiers of Merudhvaja, when they saw the Asuras,
charged them with a shout. Then a battle took place between the Daityas
and the men, but the Daityas, being in the air, pressed sore the men
who were on the ground. Then Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, mounted on his
winged steed, rushed forward, and cut and crushed the Daityas with a
shower of arrows. And those Daityas who escaped his destroying hand,
seeing him mounted on a bird, and resplendent with brightness, took to
flight, supposing that he was N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a. And all of
them fled in fear to P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and told what had happened
to Trailokyam&aacute;lin, who was at that time king of the Daityas.</p>
<p>When the king of the Asuras heard that, he quickly enquired into the
matter by means of his spies, and found out that
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja was a mortal; and unable to endure the disgrace
of having been defeated by a man, he collected all the D&aacute;navas
in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and though warned by omens to desist, he went
to that hermitage to fight. But Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja and his men,
who were on the alert there, rushed to attack the king of the
D&aacute;navas, as soon as they saw him arrive with his army. Then a
second great battle took place between the Asuras and the men; and the
gods, headed by Rudra and Indra, came in their chariots to witness
it.</p>
<p>And then Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja saw instantly presenting itself
before him there a great weapon of Pa&#347;upati, of irresistible
might, of huge size, with a flame of fire streaming up from it, with
three eyes, with four faces, with one leg, and eight arms, looking like
the fire which is to burn up the world at the end of the <i>kalpa</i>.
The weapon said, &ldquo;Know that I have come by the command of
&#346;iva, to ensure your victory.&rdquo; When the weapon said this,
the prince worshipped it and clutched it.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile those Asuras in the air, raining arrows, pressed
hard the fainting army of Merudhvaja that was below them. Then
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href=
"#pb543" name="pb543">543</a>]</span>who fought in various manners,
came to deliver that army and fought with the Asuras, placing a net of
arrows between them and his own men.</p>
<p>And when Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the king of the Asuras, saw him and
his father and brother, mounted on their air-going steeds, he sent
forth the snake-weapon. Innumerable terrible venomous snakes came out
of it, and these Malayadhvaja slew with Garu&#7693;a-birds, that came
out of the Garu&#7693;a-weapon. Then Mukt&aacute;phalaketu repelled
with case every weapon that the king of the Daityas and his son sent
forth.</p>
<p>Then that enemy of the gods, and his son, and the other
D&aacute;navas were enraged, and they all at one time launched at him
their fiery weapons. But those weapons, seeing the weapon of
Pa&#347;upati blazing in front of him, were immediately terrified and
fled.</p>
<p>Then the Daityas were terrified and tried to escape, but the hero
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja perceived their intention, and immediately
constructed above them, and on all sides of them, an impenetrable net
of arrows, like a cage of adamant. And while the D&aacute;navas were
circling within this, like birds, Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja with the help
of his father and brother, smote them with sharp arrows. And the
severed hands, feet, bodies, and heads of those Daityas fell on the
ground, and streams of blood<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15303src" href=
"#xd27e15303" name="xd27e15303src">5</a> flowed. Then the gods
exclaimed &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and followed up their acclamation with a
rain of flowers, and Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja used the bewildering
weapon against those enemies. That made the Asuras and their king fall
senseless on the earth, and then by means of the weapon of Varu&#7751;a
the prince bound them all with nooses.</p>
<p>Then the hermit Tapodhana said to king Merudhvaja, &ldquo;You must
by no means kill those Asura warriors that have escaped the slaughter:
but you must win them over and enter Ras&aacute;tala with them. As for
this king of the Daityas, and his son, and his ministers, you must take
them with the great Asuras, and the malignant N&aacute;gas, and the
principal R&aacute;kshasas, and imprison them in the cave of
&#346;veta&#347;aila in Devasabha.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15314src" href="#xd27e15314" name="xd27e15314src">6</a> When the
hermit had said this to Merudhvaja, he said to the Daitya warriors,
&ldquo;Do not be afraid, we must not slay you, but you must henceforth
be subject to the sway of this Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja and his
brother.&rdquo; When the king said this to the D&aacute;navas, they
joyfully consented to his proposal. Then the king had
Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the sovereign of the Daityas, with his son and
the others, conveyed to &#346;veta&#347;aila. And he placed them in
confinement in that cave, and had them guarded by his principal
minister, who was backed by a force of many brave warriors.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name=
"pb544">544</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, the battle having come to an end, and the gods, who were
present in their chariots, having departed, after showering
<i>mand&aacute;ra</i> flowers, an universal rejoicing took place over
the whole world, and the victorious king Merudhvaja said to his two
sons, &ldquo;I will remain here for the present to guard the sacrifice,
and do you march to P&aacute;t&aacute;la with these soldiers of ours,
who have possessed themselves of many chariots belonging to the
Daityas, and with those soldiers of the Asura army who have escaped
destruction. And conciliate and win over to our allegiance the
inhabitants of P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and appoint chief governors
throughout the territory, and having thus taken possession of it you
must return here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the heroic Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, who was mounted on his
heavenly steed, that went with a wish, and Malayadhvaja heard this, the
two brothers, with their forces, entered Ras&aacute;tala, together with
that portion of the army of the D&aacute;navas, that had made
submission, which marched in front of them. And they killed the guards
that opposed them in various places, and proclaimed an amnesty to the
others by beat of drum. And, as the people shewed confidence and were
submissive, they took possession of the seven Ras&aacute;talas, adorned
with splendid palaces<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15328src" href=
"#xd27e15328" name="xd27e15328src">7</a> built of various jewels, and
they enjoyed those palaces which were rendered delightful by gardens
that gratified every wish, and had in them lakes of heavenly wine with
many ladders of precious stone. And there they beheld D&aacute;nava
ladies of wonderful beauty, and their daughters, who by means of magic
concealed their forms within trees.</p>
<p>And then Svayamvaraprabh&aacute;, the wife of Trailokyam&aacute;lin,
began austerities in order to bring about the welfare of her imprisoned
husband, and in the same way her daughters, Trailokyaprabh&aacute; and
Tribhuvanaprabh&aacute;, began austerities for the welfare of their
father.</p>
<p>And those princes honoured with various favours all the inhabitants
of P&aacute;t&aacute;la, who were happy now that they had obtained
repose; and they appointed Sangr&aacute;masinha and others governors,
and went to their father in the hermitage of Tapodhana.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the sacrifice of the hermit there reached
completion, and the gods and the <i>&#7771;ishis</i> prepared to go to
their own abodes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15349src" href=
"#xd27e15349" name="xd27e15349src">8</a> And as Indra was exceedingly
pleased, Merudhvaja said to him, &ldquo;Come with me to my city, king
of heaven, if thou be pleased with me.&rdquo; When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href="#pb545" name=
"pb545">545</a>]</span>Indra heard that, he went, in order to please
him, with the king and his son to the city of Devasabha, after taking
leave of the hermit. And there the king, who was sovereign of two
worlds, entertained Indra so sumptuously, that he forgot his happiness
in heaven. Then Indra too, being gratified, took the king and his sons
in his own heavenly chariot to his celestial abode, and in that place
which was charming with the pleasures of a concert in which
N&aacute;rada, Rambh&aacute; and others performed, he made Merudhvaja,
with Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja and Malayadhvaja, forget their toils, and
gave them garlands from the P&aacute;rij&aacute;ta-tree, and celestial
diadems, and after honouring them, sent them home.</p>
<p>And they, when they returned, kept going to and fro between the
earth and P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and though kings of men, bare sway in
two worlds. Then Merudhvaja said to Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, &ldquo;Our
enemies are conquered; you two brothers are young men, and I have
various princesses who are subject to my sway, and I have sent for some
of them: the fitting time has come; so take to yourselves
wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja&rsquo;s father said this to him, he
answered, &ldquo;Father, my mind is not inclined to marriage at
present. I will now perform a course of austerities to
propitiate<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15380src" href="#xd27e15380"
name="xd27e15380src">9</a> &#346;iva; but let this Malayadhvaja my dear
younger brother, be married.&rdquo; When his younger brother
Malayadhvaja heard this, he said, &ldquo;Noble brother, is it fitting
that I should be married, before you have taken a wife, or that I
should hold sway while you are without a kingdom? I follow in your
footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Malayadhvaja said this, king Merudhvaja said to his eldest son
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, &ldquo;Your younger brother here has spoken
rightly, but what you have just said is not right; it is no time for
asceticism in this fresh youth of yours; the present should be to you a
time of enjoyment; so abandon, my son, this perverse crotchet of yours,
which is most inopportune.&rdquo; Though the king addressed these
admonitions to his eldest son, that prince resolutely refused to take a
wife: so the king remained silent, to wait for a more favourable
time.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, the two daughters of
Trailokyam&aacute;lin&rsquo;s wife, Svayamprabh&aacute;, who were
engaged in austerities, said to their mother, &ldquo;Mother, when one
of us was seven and the other eight years old, owing to our want of
merits,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15397src" href="#xd27e15397" name=
"xd27e15397src">10</a> our father was imprisoned, and we were hurled
from the royal rank. It is now the eighth year, that we have been
engaged in austerities, and yet &#346;iva is not pleased with us, and
our father has not, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb546" href="#pb546"
name="pb546">546</a>]</span>as yet, been released from his
imprisonment. So let us even consume these unlucky bodies in the fire,
before we also are imprisoned, or experience some other insult at the
hands of our enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Svayamprabh&aacute;&rsquo;s daughters said this to her, she
answered them, &ldquo;Wait a while, my daughters, we shall regain our
former glory. For I know that, while I was engaged in austerities, the
god &#346;iva said to me in a dream, &lsquo;My child, be of good
courage; thy husband shall recover his kingdom, and the princes
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja and Malayadhvaja shall be the husbands of thy
two daughters. And do not suppose that they are men; for one of them is
a noble Vidy&aacute;dhara, and the other is a Ga&#7751;a of
mine.&rsquo; When I had received this revelation from &#346;iva, I woke
up at the close of night; and supported by this hope I have borne great
suffering. So I will inform the king your father of this matter, and
with his consent, I will endeavour to bring about your
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the queen Svayamprabh&aacute; had in these words comforted her
daughters, she said to Indumat&iacute;, an old woman of the harem,
&ldquo;Go to my husband in the cave of &#346;veta&#347;aila, and fall
at his feet, and say to him from me, &lsquo;My husband, the Creator has
formed me of such strange wood, that, though the fire of separation
from you burns fiercely, I have not yet been consumed by it. But it is
because I entertain a hope of seeing you again that I have not
abandoned life.&rsquo; When you have said this, tell him the revelation
that &#346;iva made to me in a dream, then ask him about the marriage
of our daughters, and come back, and tell me what he says; I will then
act accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had said this, she sent off Indumat&iacute;; and she left
P&aacute;t&aacute;la and reached the well-guarded entrance of that
mountain-cave. She entreated the guards and entered, and seeing
Trailokyam&aacute;lin there a prisoner, she burst into tears, and
embraced his feet; and when he asked her how she was, she slowly told
him all his wife&rsquo;s message; then that king said, &ldquo;As for
what &#346;iva says about my restoration to my kingdom, may that turn
out as the god announced, but the idea of my giving my daughters to the
sons of Merudhvaja is preposterous. I would rather perish here than
give my daughters as a present to enemies and men too, while myself a
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Indumat&iacute; had been sent away by the king with this
message, she went and delivered it to his wife Svayamprabh&aacute;. And
when Trailokyaprabh&aacute; and Tribhuvanaprabh&aacute; the daughters
of the Daitya sovereign heard it, they said to their mother
Svayamprabh&aacute;, &ldquo;Anxiety lest our youthful purity should be
outraged makes the fire seem our only place of safety, so we will enter
it, mother, on the fourteenth day, that is now approaching.&rdquo; When
they had thus resolved, their mother and her suite also made up their
minds to die. And when the fourteenth day arrived, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb547" href="#pb547" name="pb547">547</a>]</span>they
all worshipped H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;vara, and made pyres in a holy
bathing-place called P&aacute;paripu.</p>
<p>Now it happened that on that very day king Merudhvaja, with his son,
and his wife, was coming there to worship
H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;vara. And as he was going to the holy water of
P&aacute;paripu, with his suite, to bathe, he saw smoke rising from the
midst of a grove on its bank. And when the king asked, &ldquo;How comes
smoke to be rising here?&rdquo; those governors he had set over
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, Sangr&aacute;masinha and the others, said to him,
&ldquo;Great king, Svayamprabh&aacute;, the wife of
Trailokyam&aacute;lin, is engaged in austerities here with her
daughters the princesses. Without doubt they are now performing here
some sacrificial rite in honour of the fire, or possibly they are
wearied out with excessive asceticism, and are immolating themselves by
entering it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard that, he went to see what was going on, with his
sons, and his wife, and those governors of P&aacute;t&aacute;la,
ordering the rest of his suite to remain behind. And concealing himself
there, he beheld those Daitya maidens, with their mother, worshipping
the fire of the pyres, which was burning brightly.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e15419src" href="#xd27e15419" name="xd27e15419src">11</a> They
seemed with the effulgence of the great beauty of their faces which
shone out in all directions, to be creating in the lower world a
hundred discs of the moon: and to be installing the god of love as king
after the conquest of the three worlds, with their swiftly-moving
necklaces that looked like liquid streams poured down from the golden
pitchers of their breasts. Their broad hips, surrounded with the
girdles which they wore, looked like the head of the elephant of love
adorned with a girdle of constellations. The long wavy masses of hair
which they bore, seemed like snakes made by the Creator to guard the
treasure of their beauty. When the king saw them, he was astonished,
and he said, &ldquo;The creation of the Maker of All is surprising for
the novelty that is ever being manifested in it:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15428src" href="#xd27e15428" name="xd27e15428src">12</a> for
neither Rambh&aacute;, nor Urva&#347;&iacute;, nor Tilottam&aacute; is
equal in beauty to these two daughters of the Asura king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the king was making these reflections to himself,
Trailokyaprabh&aacute;, the elder of the two Daitya maidens, after
worshipping the god present in the Fire, addressed this prayer to him,
&ldquo;Since, from the time that my mother told me of the revelation of
&#346;iva received by her in a dream, my mind has been fixed upon
prince Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, that treasure-house of virtue, as my
chosen husband, I pray, holy one, that he may be my husband in a future
birth, inasmuch as, though in this birth my mother <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb548" href="#pb548" name=
"pb548">548</a>]</span>wishes to give me to him, my haughty father,
being a captive, will not consent to it.&rdquo; When
Tribhuvanaprabh&aacute; heard that, she, in the same way, prayed to the
Fire-god that Malayadhvaja might be her husband in a future life.</p>
<p>Then king Merudhvaja, who was delighted at hearing that, and the
queen his wife said to one another, &ldquo;If our two sons could obtain
these two maidens for their wives, they would reap fruit from their
conquest of the two worlds. So let us go to them and their mother,
before they have cast themselves into the fire, as they intend to do in
a moment, and dissuade them from doing so.&rdquo; When the king, in
consultation with the queen, had made up his mind to this, he went up
to them, and said, &ldquo;Do not act rashly: for I will put a stop to
your sorrow.&rdquo; When all the Asura ladies heard this speech of the
king&rsquo;s, that seemed like a rain of nectar to their ears, and
afterwards saw him, they all bowed before him.</p>
<p>And Svayamprabh&aacute; said to him, &ldquo;Before we were concealed
by magic, and you did not see us, though we saw you, but now we have
been seen here by you, the sovereign of the two worlds. And now that we
have been seen by you, our sorrow will soon come to an end; much more
since you have bestowed on us by your own mouth a boon we never craved;
so take a seat and receive the <i>arghya</i> and water for the
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15454src" href="#xd27e15454" name=
"xd27e15454src">13</a> For you deserve to be honoured by the three
worlds; and this is our hermitage.&rdquo; When she said this, the king
answered laughing, &ldquo;Give the <i>arghya</i> and water for the feet
to these your sons-in-law.&rdquo; Then Svayamprabh&aacute; said,
&ldquo;To them the god &#346;iva will give the <i>arghya</i> and soon,
but do you receive it to-day.&rdquo; Then Merudhvaja said, &ldquo;I
have already received it all; but do you, ladies, immediately give up
your intention of committing suicide; and go and dwell in one of your
cities where every wish can be gratified; then I will take steps to
ensure your welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this, Svayamprabh&aacute; said to him, &ldquo;In
accordance with your Majesty&rsquo;s order we have given up our
intention of abandoning the body, but while our lord is in prison, how
would it be becoming for us to live in our palace? So we will remain
here, king, for the present, until your Highness shall perform the
promise which you spontaneously made to us, and shall cause our lord to
be set free with his servants and ministers. And he will hold sway as
your Majesty&rsquo;s zealous officer, and will make over his realm to
you if you desire it; indeed he will make a strict agreement<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15474src" href="#xd27e15474" name=
"xd27e15474src">14</a> with you to this effect. And for this we and all
the inhabitants of P&aacute;t&aacute;la <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb549" href="#pb549" name="pb549">549</a>]</span>will be your
sureties, so take our jewels from the regions of P&aacute;t&aacute;la,
and make them your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, king Merudhvaja said to her, &ldquo;I will see
about that, but you must remember your promise.&rdquo; When the king
had said this, he bathed and worshipped H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;a. And
those Daitya princesses, having now seen his sons with their own eyes,
had their minds entirely fixed on them. Then all the inhabitants of
Ras&aacute;tala<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15488src" href="#xd27e15488"
name="xd27e15488src">15</a> fell at the feet of the virtuous king
Merudhvaja, and asked that Trailokyam&aacute;lin should be set at
liberty; and then king Merudhvaja, with his wife, sons, and servants,
left the world of the Asuras, and returned to his own city, covering
the regions with his umbrellas white as his own glory. There his son
Malayadhvaja spent the night in thinking on the younger daughter of the
king of the D&aacute;navas, being tortured with the fever of love, and
though he closed his eyes, he never slept. But that sea of self-control
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, though he thought upon the elder daughter of
the Asura monarch who was deeply in love with him, and though he was
young, and she was fair enough to shake with love the saintly minds of
anchorites, still in virtue of the boon he had craved from the hermit,
was no whit disturbed in mind. But Merudhvaja, finding that his elder
son was determined not to take a wife, while Malayadhvaja was
desperately in love, and that on the other hand that great Asura was
averse to giving him his daughters, remained with his mind bewildered
as to how to devise an expedient.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then king Merudhvaja, seeing that Malayadhvaja was
thus overpowered with the fever of love, said to his queen, &ldquo;If
those two daughters of Trailokyam&aacute;lin, whom I saw in
P&aacute;t&aacute;la, do not become the wives of my two sons, what
advantage shall I have gained? And my son Malayadhvaja is consumed with
smouldering flame, because he cannot obtain the younger of the two,
though shame makes him conceal the fire of love. It is for this very
reason that, though I promised Trailokyam&aacute;lin&rsquo;s queen that
I would set him at liberty, I do not at once make my promise good. For,
if he is set free from his imprisonment, his pride as an Asura will
prevent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href="#pb550" name=
"pb550">550</a>]</span>his ever giving his daughters to my sons as
being men. So it is now advisable to propose this matter to him in a
conciliatory manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had gone through these reflections with the queen, he said
to his warder, &ldquo;Go to the cave of &#346;veta&#347;aila, and say,
as from me, in a kind manner to Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the king of the
Daityas, who is imprisoned there, &lsquo;King of the Daityas, by the
appointment of Destiny you have been long afflicted here, so now do
what I advise, and bring your affliction to an end. Give to my two sons
your two daughters, who fell in love with them at first sight, and thus
procure your release, and rule your kingdom, after you have given
security for your fidelity.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this message the king sent off his warder, and he went and
delivered it to the Daitya monarch in that cave. The monarch answered,
&ldquo;I will not give my two daughters to two men;&rdquo; and the
warder returned and reported his answer to the king.</p>
<p>Then king Merudhvaja began to look about for some other means of
attaining his end, and in the course of some days Svayamprabh&aacute;
heard how he had sped, so she again sent Indumat&iacute; from
P&aacute;t&aacute;la to his palace with a message.</p>
<p>And Indumat&iacute; arrived, and had herself announced by the female
warder, and went into the presence of the great queen, who received her
graciously. And she bowed before her, and said to her, &ldquo;Queen,
queen Svayamprabh&aacute; sends you this message, &lsquo;Have you
forgotten your own promise? The seas and the principal mountains will
suffer change at the day of doom, but the promises of people like you
will not change even then. Although my husband has not consented to
bestow our daughters as you wished, reflect, how could he have given
them as a present while himself a prisoner? If you release him in a
proper way as an act of kindness,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15509src"
href="#xd27e15509" name="xd27e15509src">1</a> he will certainly make
you a return by giving you his daughters. Otherwise Svayamprabh&aacute;
and her daughters will abandon their lives, and in this way you will
fail to obtain daughters-in-law, and also to keep your promise? So
manage, queen, to make the king set our lord free on the conditions of
compact and security and so on, in order that all may turn out well;
and accept this ornament sent by Svayamprabh&aacute;, studded with
various gems, that confer the power of becoming a Vidy&aacute;dhara,
and other advantages.<span class="corr" id="xd27e15515" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Indumat&iacute; said this, the queen answered her, &ldquo;How
can I take this from your mistress now that she is in trouble?&rdquo;
But Indumat&iacute; urged her vehemently to take it, saying, &ldquo;We
shall be quite unhappy if you refuse to accept it, but if you take it,
we shall consider our affliction alleviated.&rdquo; Being thus strongly
urged by Indumat&iacute;, the queen took from her that jewelled
ornament, to comfort her; and she made her wait <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb551" href="#pb551" name=
"pb551">551</a>]</span>there, saying to her, &ldquo;Remain here, noble
lady, until the king shall come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king came there, and Indumat&iacute; rose up,
and having been introduced by the queen, bowed before him, and he
received her graciously. And she gave to that king a crest-jewel sent
by Svayamprabh&aacute;, that was a talisman against poison,
R&aacute;kshasas, old age, and disease.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15524src" href="#xd27e15524" name="xd27e15524src">2</a> The king
said, &ldquo;I will accept this jewel when I have kept my promise; but
the ready-witted Indumat&iacute; said to him, &ldquo;A promise made by
the king is as good as kept. But, if your Majesty will accept this, we
shall be very much comforted.&rdquo; When she made this speech, the
queen observed, &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; and took that crest-jewel, and
fastened it on the king&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Then Indumat&iacute; repeated to the king the message of
Svayamprabh&aacute;, as she had delivered it to the queen; then the
king, being entreated to the same effect by the queen, went on to say
to Indumat&iacute;, &ldquo;Remain here for to-day; to-morrow morning I
will give you an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, king Merudhvaja allowed a night to pass, and the
next morning he summoned his ministers, and said to Indumat&iacute;,
&ldquo;Noble lady, go with these ministers of mine, and after informing
Trailokyam&aacute;lin, bring from P&aacute;t&aacute;la those Asura
ladies, Svayamprabh&aacute; and the others, and all the principal
inhabitants of P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and the water of ordeal connected
with H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;vara, in a sealed vessel. And let
Svayamprabh&aacute; and the others touch the feet of
Svayamprabh&aacute;&rsquo;s husband, in the presence of my ministers,
and by solemn oaths make themselves sureties for this, namely, that
Trailokyam&aacute;lin, with his friends and servants, shall ever remain
firm in his allegiance to me, and that the N&aacute;gas shall not
injure the crops. And let all the lords in P&aacute;t&aacute;la be
sureties to the same effect, and let them all, with their king, give
their children as hostages,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15541src" href=
"#xd27e15541" name="xd27e15541src">3</a> and let them all, with their
king, put this in writing, and drink the water of ordeal in which the
image of H&aacute;&#7789;ake&#347;vara has been washed: then I will
release Trailokyam&aacute;lin from prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said so much, the king sent off Indumat&iacute; with his
ministers. She went with them, and informed Trailokyam&aacute;lin of
what was being done, and as he approved of her proceedings, she went in
the same way to P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and she brought there
Svayamprabh&aacute; and the others, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name=
"pb552">552</a>]</span>water of ordeal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15560src" href="#xd27e15560" name="xd27e15560src">4</a> and she
made them all do in the presence of the king&rsquo;s ministers all that
he had prescribed. And when king Trailokyam&aacute;lin had in this way
given security, king Merudhvaja set him free from prison with his
suite. And he had brought him to his own palace with his family and his
attendants, and courteously entertained him; and then he took
possession of all the jewels of the Asuras, and sent
Trailokyam&aacute;lin back to his kingdom. And Trailokyam&aacute;lin
returned to Ras&aacute;tala his home, and having recovered his kingdom,
rejoiced with his servants and relations. And Merudhvaja filled the
earth with abundant treasures that came from P&aacute;t&aacute;la, as a
rain-cloud showers water.</p>
<p>Then Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the king of the Daityas, took counsel
with his wife, desiring to bestow his two beautiful daughters on
Merudhvaja&rsquo;s sons, and he invited him to his palace, with his
relations, and came himself to escort him there, remembering the
benefit conferred on him. So he came to king Merudhvaja, who
entertained him, and then he said to him, &ldquo;On a former occasion,
your great joy prevented your seeing Ras&aacute;tala properly. But now
come and see it, while we give ourselves up to attending on you; and
accept from me my two beautiful daughters for your sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Asura king had said this to Merudhvaja, the latter summoned
his wife and his two sons. And he told them the speech of the Asura
king, and how he proposed to give his two daughters; then his eldest
son Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja said to him, &ldquo;I will not marry until
I have propitiated &#346;iva; I said this long ago; you must pardon
this fault in me. When I have gone, let Malayadhvaja marry; for he will
never be happy without that P&aacute;t&aacute;la maiden.&rdquo; When
the younger son heard this, he said to his elder brother, &ldquo;Noble
sir, while you are alive, I will never perform such a disgraceful and
unrighteous act.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span>
Then king Merudhvaja earnestly exhorted Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja to
marry, but he would not consent to do so; and therefore
Trailokyam&aacute;lin took leave of the king, who was in a state of
despondency, and went back with his suite to P&aacute;t&aacute;la as he
had come.</p>
<p>There he told what had taken place and said to his wife and son,
&ldquo;Observe how exclusively bent on humiliating us Fortune is. Those
very men, to whom formerly I refused to give my daughters in marriage
when they asked for them, now refuse to accept them, though I ask them
to do so.&rdquo; When they heard it, they said, &ldquo;Who can tell how
this matter is in the mind of Destiny? Can &#346;iva&rsquo;s promise be
falsified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were saying these things, those maidens,
Trailokyaprabh&aacute; and Tribhuvanaprabh&aacute;, heard what had
happened, and took upon them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb553" href=
"#pb553" name="pb553">553</a>]</span>the following vow, &ldquo;We will
remain without food for twelve days, and if at the end of that time the
god does not shew us favour by bringing about our marriage, we will
enter the fire together, and we will not preserve our bodies for
insult, or merely for the sake of continuing in life.&rdquo; When the
daughters of the Daitya sovereign had made this vow, they remained
fasting in front of the god, engaged in meditation and muttering
prayers. And their mother and their father the sovereign of the
Daityas, hearing of it, and being very fond of their daughters,
remained fasting in the same way.</p>
<p>Then Svayamprabh&aacute; their mother quickly sent off
Indumat&iacute; once more to Merudhvaja&rsquo;s queen consort, to tell
her how matters were going. She went and told that queen the trouble in
her master&rsquo;s house, and so Merudhvaja also came to hear of it.
Then that couple abandoned food out of regard for the other royal
couple, and their sons did so as well, out of regard for their
parents.</p>
<p>Thus in two worlds the royal families were in trouble. And
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja remained without eating, and meditated on
&#346;iva as his refuge. And, after six nights had passed, in the
morning the prince woke up, and said to his friend Mah&aacute;buddhi,
who had formerly been Sam&#803;yataka, &ldquo;My friend, I remember
that last night in a dream I mounted my steed given me by the hermit
Tapodhana, that changes its shape at will, and goes where the mind
directs, and had become a flying chariot, and, in my despondency I went
to a heavenly temple of &#346;iva, very far from here, on the slope of
Meru. There I saw a certain celestial maiden emaciated with
austerities; and a certain man with matted hair, pointing to her, said
to me laughing, &lsquo;You have come here in this way to escape from
one maiden, and lo! here is another waiting for you.&rsquo; When I
heard this speech of his, I remained gazing at the beauty of that
maiden, but found it impossible to gaze my fill, and so at the end of
the night I suddenly woke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will go there to obtain that heavenly maiden, and if I
do not find her there, I will enter the fire. What can Destiny mean, by
causing my mind to become attached to this maiden seen in a dream,
after rejecting, in the way I did, the Daitya maiden, offered to me a
short time ago? At any rate, I am persuaded that, if I go there, good
fortune will certainly befall me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, he called to mind that vehicle given to him by the
hermit, which would carry him to any place conceived in the mind, and
assume any desired form. It turned into an air-going chariot, and he
mounted it, and set out for that heavenly temple of &#346;iva, and when
he reached it, he saw that it was just as it had seemed in his dream,
and he rejoiced. Then he proceeded to perform religious ablution with
all the attendant rites, in the holy water there, named Siddhodaka,
with no one to wait on him but his friend. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href="#pb554" name="pb554">554</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then his father king Merudhvaja, who was in his own city, emaciated
with fasting, accompanied by his wife, son, and suite, heard that he
had gone off somewhere secretly, and became bewildered with grief. And
all this was at once known in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, exactly as it had
taken place. Then Trailokyam&aacute;lin took with him his two
daughters, and came fasting, with his wife and suite, to visit king
Merudhvaja. And they all resolved on the following course of action;
&ldquo;Surely, as it is the fourteenth day, the prince has gone
somewhere to worship &#346;iva; so we will wait for him here this day.
But to-morrow, if he has not returned, we will go where he is: then,
happen what will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, who was in that hermitage
of &#346;iva, named Meghavana, said that very day to her
ladies-in-waiting; &ldquo;My friends, I remember that last night I went
in a dream to Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara, and a certain man wearing matted
hair came out of the temple of the god, and said to me, &lsquo;My
daughter, thy sorrow is at an end, thy reunion with thy husband is nigh
at hand.&rsquo; When he had said this, he departed, and night and sleep
left me together. So come, let us go there.&rdquo; When
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had said this, she went to that temple of
Gaur&iacute; on the slope of Meru.</p>
<p>There she saw with astonishment that Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja at a
distance bathing in Siddhodaka, and she said to her friends,
&ldquo;This man is like my beloved. Observe how very like he is.
Wonderful! Can he be the very same? It cannot be, for he is a
mortal.&rdquo; When her ladies-in-waiting heard that, and saw him, they
said to her, &ldquo;Princess, not only is this man very like your
beloved, but observe, his companion also bears a resemblance to your
lover&rsquo;s friend Sam&#803;yataka. So we know for certain that, in
accordance with your last night&rsquo;s dream which you related to us,
&#346;iva has by his power brought those two here, after their becoming
incarnate as men owing to a curse. Otherwise, how, being mortals, could
they have come to this region of the gods?&rdquo; When
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had been thus addressed by her
ladies-in-waiting, she worshipped &#346;iva, and in a state of eager
excitement, remained concealed near the god&rsquo;s symbol to find out
who the stranger was.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, having bathed, came into
the temple to worship the god, and after looking all round, said to
Mah&aacute;buddhi, &ldquo;Strange to say, here is that very temple,
which I saw in my dream, made of precious stone, with the form of
&#346;iva visible within the <i>linga</i>. And now I behold here those
very localities, which I saw in my dream, full of jewel-gleaming trees,
which are alive with heavenly birds. But I do not see here that
heavenly maiden, whom I then saw; and if I do not find her, I am
determined to abandon the body in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s ladies-in-waiting
said to her in a whisper, &ldquo;Listen! it is certain that he has come
here, because he saw you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555" href=
"#pb555" name="pb555">555</a>]</span>here in a dream, and if he does
not find you, he intends to surrender his life; so let us remain here
concealed, and see what he means to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while they remained there in concealment,
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja entered, and worshipped the god, and came out.
And when he came out, he devoutly walked round the temple three times,
keeping his right hand towards it, and then he and his friend
remembered their former birth, and in their joy they were telling to
one another the events of their life as Vidy&aacute;dharas, when
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; met their view. And Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja,
remembering the occurrences of his former life, as soon as he saw her,
was filled with joy, and said to his friend, &ldquo;Lo! this very
princess Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the lady I saw in my dream! and she
has come here by good luck; so I will at once go and speak to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, he went up to her weeping and said,
&ldquo;Princess, do not go away anywhere now; for I am your former
lover Mukt&aacute;phalaketu. I became a man by the curse of the hermit
D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata, and I have now remembered my former
birth.&rdquo; When he had said this, he tried, in his eagerness, to
embrace her. But she was alarmed and made herself invisible, and
remained there with her eyes full of tears: and the prince, not seeing
her, fell on the ground in a swoon.</p>
<p>Then his friend sorrowfully spoke these words into the air,
&ldquo;How is it, princess Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, that, now this
lover has come, for whom you suffered such severe austerities, you will
not speak to him? I too am Sam&#803;yataka the comrade of your beloved:
why do you not say something kind to me, as I was cursed for
you?&rdquo; After saying this, he restored the prince, and said to him,
&ldquo;This punishment has come upon you as the result of the crime you
committed in not accepting the Daitya princess, who offered herself to
you out of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, who was concealed, heard this, she
said to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;Listen, he has no inclination for
Asura maidens.&rdquo; Then her ladies said to her, &ldquo;You see that
all tallies together. Do you not remember that long ago, when your
beloved was cursed, he craved as a boon from the hermit Tapodhana, that
while he was a man, his heart might never be inclined to any one but
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. It is in virtue of that boon that he now feels
no love for other women.&rdquo; When the princess heard this, she was
bewildered with doubt.</p>
<p>Then Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, who had no sooner seen his beloved,
than she disappeared from his eyes, cried out, &ldquo;Ah! my beloved
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, do you not see that when I was a
Vidy&aacute;dhara, I incurred a curse in Meghavana for your sake? And
now be assured that I shall meet my death here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard him utter this and other laments,
she said to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;Though all indications seem
to tally, still these two may possibly have heard these things at some
time or other by communication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb556"
href="#pb556" name="pb556">556</a>]</span>from mouth to mouth, and
therefore my mind is not convinced. But I cannot bear to listen to his
sorrowful exclamations, so I will go to that temple of
Gaur&iacute;<span class="corr" id="xd27e15616" title=
"Source: :">;</span> moreover it is the hour of worship for me
there.&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; had said this, she went with
her ladies-in-waiting to that hermitage of Ambik&aacute;, and after
worshipping the goddess she offered this prayer, &ldquo;If the man I
have just seen in Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara is really my former lover,
bring about for me, goddess, my speedy reunion with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; was there, longing for her
beloved, Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, who had remained behind in
Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara, said to his friend Mah&aacute;buddhi, who had
been in a former life his friend Sam&#803;yataka, &ldquo;I am
convinced, my friend, that she has gone to her own haunt, that temple
of Gaur&iacute;; so come, let us go there.&rdquo; When he had said
this, he ascended that chariot of his, which went wherever the mind
desired, and flew to that hermitage of Ambik&aacute;.</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s ladies-in-waiting saw him afar
off, coming down in the chariot from the sky, they said to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, &ldquo;Princess, behold this marvel. He has
come here also, travelling in an air-going chariot; how can he, a mere
man, have such power?&rdquo; Then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; said,
&ldquo;My friends, do you not remember that on D&#7771;i&#7693;havrata,
who cursed him, I laid the following curse, &lsquo;When my beloved is
incarnate as a man, you shall be his vehicle, assuming any desired
shape, and moving in obedience to a wish.&rsquo; So, no doubt, this is
that hermit&rsquo;s pupil, his vehicle, wearing at present the form of
an air-going chariot, and by means of it he roams everywhere at
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, her ladies-in-waiting said to her, &ldquo;If you
know this to be the case, princess, why do you not speak to him? What
are you waiting for?&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard this
speech of her ladies&rsquo;, she went on to say, &ldquo;I think that
this probably is the case, but I am not absolutely certain as yet. But,
even supposing he really is my beloved, how can I approach him, now
that he is not in his own body, but in another body? So, let us for a
time watch his proceedings, being ourselves concealed.&rdquo; When the
princess had said this, she remained there concealed, surrounded by her
ladies-in-waiting.</p>
<p>Then Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja descended from the chariot in that
hermitage of Ambik&aacute;, and being full of longing, said to his
friend, &ldquo;Here I had my first interview with my beloved, when she
had been terrified by the R&aacute;kshas&iacute;s; and I again saw her
in the garden here, when she came having chosen me for her own; and
here I received the curse, and she wished to follow me by dying; but
was, though with difficulty, prevented by that great hermit: and now,
see, that very same lady flies out of reach of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard him speak thus, she said to her
ladies-in-waiting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href="#pb557"
name="pb557">557</a>]</span>&ldquo;True, my friends, it is really my
beloved, but how can I approach him, before he has entered his former
body? In this matter <span class="corr" id="xd27e15632" title=
"Source: Siddh&iacute;svara">Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara</span> is my only
hope. He sent me the dream, and he will provide for me a way out of my
difficulties.&rdquo; When she had formed this resolution, she went back
to Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara. And she worshipped that manifestation of
&#346;iva, and offered this prayer to him, &ldquo;Unite me with my
beloved in his former body, or bestow death on me. I see no third way
of escape from my woe.&rdquo; And then she remained with her friends in
the court of the god&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja searched for the princess
in the temple of <span class="corr" id="xd27e15637" title=
"Source: Gauri">Gaur&iacute;</span>, and not finding her was
despondent, and said to that friend, &ldquo;I have not found her here;
let us go back to that temple of &#346;iva; if I cannot find her there,
I will enter the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that friend heard it, he said, &ldquo;Good luck will befall
you! The word of the hermit and &#346;iva&rsquo;s promise in your dream
cannot be falsified.&rdquo; With those words did
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja&rsquo;s friend try to comfort him; and then
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja ascended the chariot, and went with him to
Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara.</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; saw him arrive, she still remained
there invisible, and she said to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;Look! he
has come to this very place.&rdquo; He too entered, and seeing that
offerings had been recently placed in front of the god, prince
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja said to that companion of his, &ldquo;Look, my
friend, some one has been quite recently worshipping this symbol of the
god; surely, that beloved of mine must be somewhere here, and she must
have done this worship.&rdquo; When he had said this, he looked for
her, but could not find her; and then in the anguish of separation he
cried out again and again, &ldquo;Ah! my beloved
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, thinking that the cry of the cuckoo was her voice, and that
the tail of the peacock was her hair, and that the lotus was her face,
the prince ran wildly about, overpowered with an attack of the fever of
love, and with difficulty did his friend console him; and coaxing him,
he said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you have taken up, being weak
with much fasting? Why do you disregard your own welfare, though you
have conquered the earth and P&aacute;t&aacute;la? Your father
Merudhvaja, and king Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the king of the
D&aacute;navas, your future father-in-law, and his daughter
Trailokyaprabh&aacute;, who wishes to marry you, and your mother
Vinayavat&iacute;, and your younger brother Malayadhvaja will, if you
do not go to them, suspect that some misfortune has happened, and
fasting as they are, will give up their breath. So come along! Let us
go and save their lives, for the day is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja&rsquo;s friend said this to him, he
answered him, &ldquo;Then go yourself in my chariot and comfort
them.&rdquo; Then his friend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb558" href=
"#pb558" name="pb558">558</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;How will that
hermit&rsquo;s pupil, who has been made your vehicle by a curse, submit
to me?<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the
prince&rsquo;s friend said this, he replied, &ldquo;Then wait a little,
my friend; let us see what will happen here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard this conversation of theirs, she
said to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;I know that this is my former
lover by all the notes tallying, but he is degraded by the curse, being
enclosed in a human body, and I too am thus afflicted with a curse,
because I laughed at the Siddha-maiden.&rdquo; While she was saying
this, the moon rose, red in hue, the fire that devours the forest of
separated lovers. And gradually the moonlight filled the world on every
side, and the flame of love&rsquo;s fire filled the heart of
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja.</p>
<p>Then the prince began to lament like a <i>chakrav&aacute;ka</i> at
the approach of night; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, who was concealed,
being despondent, said to him, &ldquo;Prince, though you are my former
lover, still, as you are now in another body, you are to me a strange
man, and I am to you as the wife of another; so why do you lament again
and again? Surely some means will be provided, if that speech of the
hermit&rsquo;s was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja heard this speech of hers, and could
not see her, he fell into a state which was painful from the contending
emotions of joy and despondency; and he said to her, &ldquo;Princess,
my former birth has returned to my recollection, and so I recognised
you, as soon as I saw you, for you still wear your old body, but as you
saw me when I was dwelling in my Vidy&aacute;dhara<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e15662src" href="#xd27e15662" name="xd27e15662src">5</a> body,
how can you recognise me, now that I am in a mortal body? So I must
certainly abandon this accursed frame.&rdquo; When he had said this, he
remained silent, and his beloved continued in concealment.</p>
<p>Then, the night being almost gone, and his friend Mah&aacute;buddhi,
who was formerly Sam&#803;yataka, having gone to sleep out of
weariness, prince Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, thinking that he could never
obtain Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, as long as he continued in that body,
collected wood,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15667src" href="#xd27e15667"
name="xd27e15667src">6</a> and lighted a fire; and worshipped &#346;iva
embodied in the <i>linga</i>, uttering this prayer, &ldquo;Holy one,
may I by thy favour return to my former body, and soon obtain my
beloved Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;!&rdquo; And having said this, he
consumed his body in that blazing fire.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Mah&aacute;buddhi woke up, and not being able,
in spite of careful search, to find Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, and seeing
the fire blazing up, he came to the conclusion that his friend,
distracted with separation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb559" href=
"#pb559" name="pb559">559</a>]</span>had burnt himself, and out of
regret for his loss, he flung himself into that same fire.</p>
<p>When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; saw that, she was tortured with grief,
and she said to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;Alas! Fie! the female
heart is harder than the thunderbolt, otherwise my breath must have
left me beholding this horror. So, how long am I to retain this
wretched life? Even now, owing to my demerits, there is no end to my
woe; moreover, the promise of that hermit has been falsified; so it is
better that I should die. But it is not fitting that I should enter
this fire and be mixed up with strange men, so in this difficult
conjuncture hanging, which gives no trouble, is my best
resource.&rdquo; When the princess had said this, she went in front of
&#346;iva, and proceeded to make a noose by means of a creeper, which
she fastened to an <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree.</p>
<p>And while her ladies-in-waiting were trying to prevent her by
encouraging speeches, that hermit Tapodhana came there. He said,
&ldquo;My daughter, do not act rashly, that promise of mine will not be
falsified. Be of good courage, you shall see that husband of yours come
here in a moment. His curse has been just now cancelled by virtue of
your penance; so why do you now distrust the power of your own
austerities? And why do you shew this despondency when your marriage is
at hand? I have come here because I learnt all this by my power of
meditation.&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; saw the hermit
approaching uttering these words, she bowed before him, and was for a
moment, as it were, swung to and fro by perplexity. Then her beloved
Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, having by the burning of his mortal body entered
his own Vidy&aacute;dhara body, came there with his friend. And
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, seeing that son of the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas coming through the air, as a female
<i>ch&aacute;taka</i> beholds a fresh rain-cloud, or a
<i>kumudvat&iacute;</i> the full moon newly risen, felt indescribable
joy in her heart. And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, when he saw her, rejoiced,
and so to speak, drank her in with his eyes, as a traveller, wearied
with long wandering in a desert, rejoices, when he beholds a river. And
those two, reunited like a couple of <i>chakrav&aacute;kas</i> by the
termination of the night of their curse, took their fill of falling at
the feet of that hermit of glowing brilliancy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15703src" href="#xd27e15703" name="xd27e15703src">7</a> Then that
great hermit welcomed them in the following words, &ldquo;My heart has
been fully gratified to-day by seeing you reunited, happy at having
come to the end of your curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the night had passed, king Merudhvaja came there in search
of them, mounted on the elephant of Indra, accompanied by his wife and
his youngest son, and also Trailokyam&aacute;lin the sovereign of the
Daityas, with his daughter Trailokyaprabh&aacute;, mounted on a
chariot, attended by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb560" href=
"#pb560" name="pb560">560</a>]</span><i>harem</i> and his suite. Then
the hermit pointed out Mukt&aacute;phalaketu to those two kings and
described what had taken place, how he had become a man by a curse, in
order to do a service to the gods, and how he had been delivered from
his human condition. And when Merudhvaja and the others heard that,
though they were before eager to throw themselves into the fire, they
bathed in Siddhodaka and worshipped &#346;iva, by the hermit&rsquo;s
direction, and were at once delivered from their sorrow. Then that
Trailokyaprabh&aacute; suddenly called to mind her birth and said to
herself &ldquo;Truly I am that same Devaprabh&aacute;, the daughter of
the king of the Siddhas, who, when undergoing austerities<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15712src" href="#xd27e15712" name=
"xd27e15712src">8</a> in order that the emperor of all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas might be my husband, was ridiculed by
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and entered the fire to gain the fulfilment of
my desire. And now I have been born in this Daitya race, and here is
this very prince with whom I was in love, who has recovered his
Vidy&aacute;dhara body. But it is not fitting that, now that his body
is changed, he should be united to this body of mine, so I will consume
my Asura body also in the fire, in order to obtain him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone through these reflections in her mind, and having
communicated her intention to her parents, she entered<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15729src" href="#xd27e15729" name=
"xd27e15729src">9</a> the fire which had consumed
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja; and then the god of fire himself appeared with
her, on whom out of pity he had bestowed her former body, and said to
Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, &ldquo;Mukt&aacute;phaladhvaja, this lady
Devaprabh&aacute;, the daughter of the king of the Siddhas, for thy
sake abandoned her body in me; so receive her as thy wife.&rdquo; When
the god of fire had said this, he disappeared; and Brahm&aacute; came
there with Indra and the rest of the gods, and Padma&#347;ekhara the
king of the Gandharvas, with Chandraketu, the sovereign of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then that prosperous king of the
Gandharvas<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15735src" href="#xd27e15735"
name="xd27e15735src">10</a> gave his daughter Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;,
with due rites and much activity on the part of his followers, as wife
to Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, who bowed before him, congratulated by all.
And then that prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, having obtained that
beloved, whom he had so long desired, considered that he had gathered
the fruit of the tree of his birth, and married also that
Siddha-maiden. And prince Malayadhvaja was united to that Daitya
princess, his beloved Tribhuvanaprabh&aacute;, whom her father bestowed
on him with due rites. Then Merudhvaja, having, on account of his son
Malayadhvaja&rsquo;s complete success, anointed him to be sole ruler of
a kingdom extending <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href="#pb561"
name="pb561">561</a>]</span>over the earth with all its islands, went
with his wife to the forest to perform austerities. And
Trailokyam&aacute;lin, the king of the Daityas, went with his wife to
his own region, and Indra gave to Mukt&aacute;phalaketu the splendid
kingdom of Vidyuddhvaja. And this voice came from heaven, &ldquo;Let
this Mukt&aacute;phalaketu enjoy the sovereignty over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas and Asuras, and let the gods go to their own
abodes!&rdquo; When they heard that voice, Brahm&aacute; and Indra and
the other gods went away delighted, and the hermit Tapodhana went with
his pupil, who was released from his curse, and Chandraketu went to his
own Vidy&aacute;dhara home, with his son Mukt&aacute;phalaketu who was
graced by two wives. And there the king, together with his son, long
enjoyed the dignity of emperor over the Vidy&aacute;dharas, but at last
he threw on him the burden of his kingdom, and, disgusted with the
world and its pleasures, went with the queen to an ascetic grove of
hermits. And Mukt&aacute;phalaketu, having before obtained from Indra
the rule over the Asuras, and again from his father the empire over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, enjoyed, in the society of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;,
who seemed like an incarnation of happiness, for ten <i>kalpas</i>, the
good fortune of all the pleasures which the sway of those two wealthy
realms could yield, and thus obtained the highest success. But he saw
that passions are in their end distasteful, and at last he entered a
wood of mighty hermits, and by the eminence of his asceticism obtained
the highest glory, and became a companion of the lord &#346;iva.</p>
<p>Thus king Brahmadatta and his wife and his minister heard this
romantic tale from the couple of swans, and gained knowledge from their
teaching, and obtained the power of flying through the air like gods;
and then they went accompanied by those two birds to
Siddh&iacute;&#347;vara,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15756src" href=
"#xd27e15756" name="xd27e15756src">11</a> and there they all laid aside
the bodies they had entered in consequence of the curse, and were
reinstated in their former position as attendants upon
&#346;iva.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15762src" href="#xd27e15762"
name="xd27e15762src">12</a></p>
<p>Hearing this story from Gomukha in the absence of
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, for a moment only, hermits, I cheered my heart
with hope.</p>
<p>When the emperor Narav&aacute;hanadatta had told this story, those
hermits in the hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa, accompanied by
Gop&aacute;laka, rejoiced exceedingly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&ldquo;Moreover, when, during my separation from the queen,

separated from my beloved and in a foreign land; but while, in this
state of mind, I was roaming about in a remote part of the forest, I
beheld the great hermit Kanva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That compassionate hermit, seeing me bowing at his feet, and
knowing by the insight of profound meditation that I was miserable,
took me to his hermitage, and said to me, &lsquo;Why are you
distracted, though you are a hero sprung from the race of the Moon? As
the ordinance of the god standeth sure, why should you despair of
reunion with your wife?</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of Vikram&aacute;ditya.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in Avanti a famous city, named
Ujjayin&iacute;, the dwelling-place of &#346;iva, built by
Vi&#347;vakarman in the commencement or the Yuga; which, like a
virtuous woman, is invincible by strangers; like a lotus-plant is the
resort of the goddess of prosperity; like the heart of the good, is
rich in virtue; like the earth, is full of many wonderful sights.</p>
<p>There dwelt in that city a world-conquering king, named
Mahendr&aacute;ditya, the slayer of his enemies&rsquo; armies, like
Indra in Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;. In regard of prowess he was a wielder
of many weapons; in regard of beauty he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb564" href="#pb564" name="pb564">564</a>]</span>was the
flower-weaponed god<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15798src" href=
"#xd27e15798" name="xd27e15798src">1</a> himself; his hand was ever
open in bounty, but was firmly clenched on the hilt of his sword. That
king had a wife named Saumyadar&#347;an&aacute;, who was to him as
&#346;ach&iacute; to Indra, as Gaur&iacute; to &#346;iva, as
&#346;r&iacute; to Vish&#7751;u. And that king had a great minister
named Sumati, and a warder named Vajr&aacute;yudha, in whose family the
office was hereditary. With these the king remained ruling his realm,
propitiating &#346;iva, and ever bearing various vows in order to
obtain a son.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, as &#346;iva was with P&aacute;rvat&iacute; on the
mighty mountain Kail&aacute;sa, the glens of which are visited by
troops of gods, which is beautiful with the smile that the Northern
quarter smiles joyous at vanquishing all the others, all the gods with
Indra at their head came to visit him, being afflicted by the
oppression of the Mlechchhas; and the immortals bowed, and then sat
down and praised &#346;iva; and when he asked them the reason of their
coming, they addressed to him this prayer<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e15803" title="Source: ;">:</span> &ldquo;O god, those Asuras, who
were slain by thee and Vish&#7751;u, have been now again born on the
earth in the form of Mlechchhas. They slay Br&aacute;hmans, they
interfere with the sacrifices and other ceremonies, and they carry off
the daughters of hermits: indeed, what crime do not the villains
commit? Now, thou knowest, lord, that the world of gods is ever
nourished by the earth, for the oblation offered in the fire by
Br&aacute;hmans nourishes the dwellers in heaven. But, as the
Mlechchhas have overrun the earth, the auspicious words are nowhere
pronounced over the burnt-offering, and the world of gods is being
exhausted by the cutting off of their share of the sacrifice and other
supplies.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15806src" href="#xd27e15806" name=
"xd27e15806src">2</a> So devise an expedient in this matter; cause some
hero to become incarnate on the earth, mighty enough to destroy those
Mlechchhas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;iva had been thus entreated by the gods, he said to them,
&ldquo;Depart; you need not be anxious about this matter; be at your
ease. Rest assured that I will soon devise an expedient which will meet
the difficulty.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had said this, he dismissed the
gods to their abodes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15811src" href=
"#xd27e15811" name="xd27e15811src">3</a></p>
<p>And when they had gone, the Holy one, with P&aacute;rvat&iacute; at
his side, summoned a Ga&#7751;a, named M&aacute;lyavat, and gave him
this order, &ldquo;My son, descend into the condition of a man, and be
born in the city of Ujjayin&iacute; as the brave son of king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya. That king is a portion of me, and his wife is
sprung from a portion of Ambik&aacute;; be born in their family, and do
the heaven-dwellers the service they require. Slay all those Mlechchhas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href="#pb565" name=
"pb565">565</a>]</span>that obstruct the fulfilment of the law
contained in the three Vedas. And by my favour thou shalt be a king
ruling over the seven divisions of the world; moreover the
R&aacute;kshasas, the Yakshas and the Vet&aacute;las shall own thy
supremacy;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15824src" href="#xd27e15824"
name="xd27e15824src">4</a> and after thou hast enjoyed human pleasures,
thou shalt again return to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Ga&#7751;a M&aacute;lyavat received this command from
&#346;iva, he said &ldquo;The command of you two divine beings cannot
be disobeyed by me: but what enjoyments are there in the life of a man,
which involves separations from relations, friends, and servants, very
hard to bear, and the pain arising from loss of wealth, old age,
disease, and the other ills of humanity?&rdquo; When the Ga&#7751;a
said this to &#346;iva, the god thus replied, &ldquo;Go, blameless one!
These woes shall not fall to thy lot; by my favour thou shalt be happy
throughout the whole of thy sojourn on earth.&rdquo; When &#346;iva
said this to M&aacute;lyavat, that virtuous Ga&#7751;a immediately
disappeared. And he went and was conceived in Ujjayin&iacute;, in the
proper season, in the womb of the queen of king
Mahendr&aacute;ditya.</p>
<p>And at that time the god, whose diadem is fashioned of a digit of
the moon, said to that king in a dream, &ldquo;I am pleased with thee,
king, so a son shall be born to thee, who by his might shall conquer
the earth with all its divisions; and that hero shall reduce under his
sway the Yakshas, R&aacute;kshasas, Pi&#347;&aacute;chas and others,
even those that move in the air, and dwell in P&aacute;t&aacute;la, and
shall slay the hosts of the Mlechchhas; for this reason he shall be
named Vikram&aacute;ditya; and also Vishama&#347;&iacute;la on account
of his stern hostility<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15831src" href=
"#xd27e15831" name="xd27e15831src">5</a> to his enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the god had said this, he disappeared; and next morning the
king woke up, and joyfully related his dream to his ministers. And they
also told the king, one after another, with great delight, that
&#346;iva had made a revelation to each of them in a dream that he was
to have a son. And at that moment a handmaid of the harem came and
shewed the king a fruit, saying, &ldquo;&#346;iva gave this to the
queen in a dream.&rdquo; Then the king rejoiced, saying, again and
again, &ldquo;Truly, &#346;iva has given me a son,&rdquo; and his
ministers congratulated him.</p>
<p>Then his illustrious queen became pregnant, like the eastern quarter
in the morning, when the orb of the sun is about to arise, and she was
conspicuous for the black tint of the nipples of her breasts, which
appeared like a seal to secure the milk for the king with whom she was
pregnant. In her dreams at that time she crossed seven seas, being
worshipped by all the Yakshas, Vet&aacute;las, and R&aacute;kshasas.
And when the due time was come, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb566"
href="#pb566" name="pb566">566</a>]</span>she brought forth a glorious
son, who lit up the chamber, as the rising sun does the heaven. And
when he was born, the sky became indeed glorious, laughing with the
falling rain of flowers, and ringing with the noise of the gods&rsquo;
drums. And on that occasion the city was altogether distracted with
festive joy, and appeared as if intoxicated, as if possessed by a
demon, as if generally wind-struck. And at that time the king rained
wealth there so unceasingly, that, except the Buddhists, no one was
without a god.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15846src" href="#xd27e15846"
name="xd27e15846src">6</a> And king Mahendr&aacute;ditya gave him the
name of Vikram&aacute;ditya, which &#346;iva had mentioned, and also
that of Vishama&#347;&iacute;la.</p>
<p>When some more days had passed, there was born to that king&rsquo;s
minister, named Sumati, a son of the name of Mah&aacute;mati, and the
warder Vajr&aacute;yudha had a son born to him, named
Bhadhr&aacute;yudha, and the chaplain Mah&iacute;dhara had a son of the
name of &#346;r&iacute;dhara. And that prince Vikram&aacute;ditya grew
up with those three minister&rsquo;s sons, as with spirit, courage, and
might. When he was invested with the sacred thread, and put under
teachers, they were merely the occasions of his learning the sciences,
which revealed themselves to him without effort. And whatever science
or accomplishment he was seen to employ, was known by those, who
understood it, to be possessed by him to the highest degree of
excellence. And when people saw that prince fighting with heavenly
weapons, they even began to pay less attention to the stories about the
great archer R&aacute;ma and other heroes of the kind. And his father
brought for him beautiful maidens, given by kings who had submitted
after defeat, like so many goddesses of Fortune.</p>
<p>Then his father, king Mahendr&aacute;ditya, seeing that his son was
in the bloom of early manhood, of great valour, and beloved by the
subjects, duly anointed him heir to his realm, and being himself old,
retired with his wife and ministers to <span class="corr" id=

id="xd27e15860src" href="#xd27e15860" name="xd27e15860src">7</a> and
made the god &#346;iva his refuge.</p>
<p>And king Vikram&aacute;ditya, having obtained that kingdom of his
father, began in due course to blaze forth, as the sun, when it has
occupied the sky. Even haughty kings, when they saw the string fitted
into the notch of his bending bow,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15867src"
href="#xd27e15867" name="xd27e15867src">8</a> learnt a lesson from that
weapon, and bent likewise on every side. Of godlike dignity, having
subdued to his sway even Vet&aacute;las, R&aacute;kshasas and other
demons, he chastised righteously those that followed evil courses. The
armies of that Vikram&aacute;ditya roamed over the earth like the rays
of the sun, shedding into every quarter the light of order. Though that
king was a mighty hero, he dreaded the other world, <span class=

<p>And one day, as the king Vikram&aacute;ditya was in the hall of
assembly, the warder Bhadr&aacute;yudha came in and said to him,
&ldquo;Your Majesty despatched Vikrama&#347;akti with an army to
conquer the southern region and other territories, and then sent to him
a messenger named Anangadeva; that messenger has now returned, and is
at the gate with another, and his delighted face announces good
tidings, my lord.&rdquo; The king said, &ldquo;Let him enter,&rdquo;
and then the warder respectfully introduced Anangadeva, with his
companion. The messenger entered and bowed, and shouted
&ldquo;Victory&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15888src" href=
"#xd27e15888" name="xd27e15888src">11</a> and sat down in front of the
king; and then the king said to him, &ldquo;Is it well with king
Vikrama&#347;akti, the general of my forces, and with
Vy&aacute;ghrabala and the other kings? And does good fortune attend on
the other chief R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts in his army, and on the
elephants, horses, chariots and footmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Anangadeva had been thus questioned by the king, he answered,
&ldquo;It is well with Vikrama&#347;akti and the whole of the army. And
Your Majesty has conquered the Dekkan and the western border, and
Madhyade&#347;a and Saur&aacute;sh&#7789;ra and all the eastern region
of the Ganges; and the northern region and Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra have
been made tributary, and various forts and islands have been conquered,
and the hosts of the Mlechchhas have been slain, and the rest have been
reduced to submission, and various kings have entered the camp of
Vikrama&#347;akti, and he himself is coming here with those kings, and
is now, my lord, two or three marches off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the messenger had thus told his tale, king Vikram&aacute;ditya
was pleased and loaded<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15895src" href=
"#xd27e15895" name="xd27e15895src">12</a> him with garments, ornaments,
and villages. Then the king went on to say to that noble messenger,
&ldquo;Anangadeva, when you went there, what regions did you see, and
what object of interest did you meet with anywhere? Tell me, my good
fellow!&rdquo; When Anangadeva had been thus questioned by the king, he
began to recount his adventures, as follows:&mdash; <span class=

<h3 class="main">The adventures of Anangadeva.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having set out hence by Your Majesty&rsquo;s orders, I
reached in course of time that army of yours assembled under
Vikrama&#347;akti, which was like a broad sea resorted to by allied
kings, adorned by many princes of the N&aacute;gas that had come
together with horses and royal magnificence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e15908src" href="#xd27e15908" name="xd27e15908src">13</a> And when
I arrived there, that Vikrama&#347;akti bowed before me, and treated me
with great respect, because I had been sent by his sovereign; and while
I was there considering the nature of the triumphs he had gained, a
messenger from the king of Sinhala<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15911src"
href="#xd27e15911" name="xd27e15911src">14</a> came there.</p>
<p>And that messenger, who had come from Sinhala, told to
Vikrama&#347;akti in my presence his master&rsquo;s message as follows,
&ldquo;I have been told by messengers, who have been sent by me to your
sovereign and have returned, that your sovereign&rsquo;s very heart
Anangadeva is with you, so send him to me quickly, I will reveal to him
a certain auspicious affair, that concerns your king.&rdquo; Then
Vikrama&#347;akti said to me, &ldquo;Go quickly to the king of Sinhala;
and see what he wishes to say to you when he has you before
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I went through the sea in a ship to the island of Sinhala with
that king of Sinhala&rsquo;s ambassador. And in that island I saw a
palace all made of gold, with terraces of various jewels, like the city
of the gods. And in it I saw that king of Sinhala, V&iacute;rasena,
surrounded by obedient ministers, as Indra is by the gods. When I
approached him, he received me politely, and asked me about Your
Majesty&rsquo;s health, and then he refreshed me with most sumptuous
hospitality.</p>
<p>The next day the king summoned me, when he was in his hall of
audience; and showing his devotion to you, said to me in the presence
of his ministers, &ldquo;I have a maiden daughter, the peerless beauty
of the world of mortals, Madanalekh&aacute; by name, and I offer her to
your king. She is a fitting wife for him, and he is a suitable husband
for her; for this reason I have invited you; so accept her in the name
of your king.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15922src" href="#xd27e15922"
name="xd27e15922src">15</a> And go on in front with my ambassador to
tell your master; I will send my daughter here close after
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, he summoned into that hall his daughter
whose load of ornaments was adorned by her graceful shape, loveliness,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb569" href="#pb569" name=
"pb569">569</a>]</span>youth. And he made her sit on his lap, and
shewing her, said to me, &ldquo;I offer this girl to your master,
receive her.&rdquo; And when I saw that princess, I was astonished at
her beauty, and I said joyfully, &ldquo;I accept this maiden on behalf
of my sovereign,&rdquo; and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Well, the
Creator is never tired of producing marvels, since even after creating
Tilottam&aacute;, he has produced this far superior beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having been honoured by that king, I set forth from that
island, with this ambassador of his, Dhavalasena. So we embarked on a
ship, and as we were sailing along in it, through the sea, we suddenly
saw a great sandbank in the middle of the ocean. And on it we saw two
maidens of singular beauty; one had a body as dark as <i>priyangu</i>,
the other gleamed white like the moon, and they both looked more
splendid from having put on dresses and ornaments suited to their
respective hues. They made a sound like the clashing of cymbals with
their bracelets adorned with splendid gems, and they were making a
young toy-deer, which, though of gold and studded with jewels to
represent spots, possessed life, dance in front of them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15940src" href="#xd27e15940" name=
"xd27e15940src">16</a> When we saw this, we were astonished and we said
to one another, &ldquo;What can this wonder mean? Is it a dream, magic,
or delusion? Who would ever expect to see a sandbank suddenly start up
in the middle of the ocean, or such maidens upon it? And who would ever
have thought of seeing such a thing as this living golden deer studded
with jewels, which they possess? Such things are not usually found
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While we were saying this to one another, king, in the greatest
astonishment, a wind suddenly began to blow, tossing up the sea. That
wind broke up our ship, which was resting on the surging waves, and the
people in it were whelmed in the sea, and the sea-monsters began to
devour them. But those two maidens came and supported both of us in
their arms, and lifted us up and carried us to the sandbank, so that we
escaped the jaws of the sea-monsters. And then that bank began to be
covered with waves, at which we were terrified, but those two ladies
cheered us, and made us enter what seemed like the interior of a cave.
There we began to look at a heavenly wood of various trees, and while
we were looking at it, the sea disappeared, and the bank, and the young
deer, and the maidens.</p>
<p>We wandered about there for a time, saying to ourselves, &ldquo;What
is this strange thing? It is assuredly some magic.&rdquo; And then we
saw there a great lake, transparent, deep, and broad, like the heart of
great men, looking like a material representation of
Nirv&aacute;&#7751;a that allays the fire of desire.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e15953src" href="#xd27e15953" name="xd27e15953src">17</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb570" href="#pb570" name=
"pb570">570</a>]</span></p>
<p>And we saw a certain beautiful woman, coming to bathe in it,
accompanied by her train, looking like an incarnation of the beauty of
the wood. And that lady alighted from her covered chariot,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e15962src" href="#xd27e15962" name=
"xd27e15962src">18</a> and gathered lotuses in that lake, and bathed in
it, and meditated on &#346;iva. And thereupon, to our astonishment,
&#346;iva arose from the lake, a present god, in the form of a
<i>linga</i>, composed of splendid jewels, and came near her; and that
fair one worshipped him with various luxuries suited to her majesty,
and then took her lyre. And she played upon it, singing skilfully to it
with rapt devotion, following the southern style in respect of notes,
time, and words. So splendid was her performance that even the Siddhas
and other beings appeared there in the air, having their hearts
attracted by hearing it, and remained motionless as if painted. And
after she had finished her music,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e15971src"
href="#xd27e15971" name="xd27e15971src">19</a> she dismissed the god,
and he immediately sank in the lake. Then the gazelle-eyed lady rose
up, and mounted her chariot, and proceeded to go away slowly with her
train.</p>
<p>We followed her, and eagerly asked her train over and over again,
who she was, but none of them gave us any answer. Then, wishing to shew
that ambassador of the king of Sinhala your might, I said to her aloud,
&ldquo;Auspicious one, I adjure thee by the touch of king
Vikram&aacute;ditya&rsquo;s feet, that thou depart not hence without
revealing to me who thou art.&rdquo; When the lady heard this, she made
her train retire, and alighted from her chariot, and coming up to me,
she said with a gentle voice, &ldquo;Is my lord the noble king
Vikram&aacute;ditya well? But why do I ask, Anangadeva, since I know
all about him? For I exerted magic power, and brought you here for the
sake of that king, for I must honour him, as he delivered me from a
great danger. So come to my palace; there I will tell you all, who I
am, and why I ought to honour that king, and what service he needs to
have done him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had said this, having left her chariot out of courtesy,
that fair one went along the path on foot and respectfully conducted me
to her castle, which looked like heaven; it was built of various jewels
and different kinds of gold; its gates were guarded on every side by
brave warriors wearing various forms, and bearing various weapons; and
it was full of noble ladies of remarkable beauty, looking as if they
were charms that drew down endless heavenly enjoyments. There she
honoured us with baths, unguents, splendid dresses and ornaments, and
made us rest for a time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb571" href=

<h3 class="main">Story of Madanamanjar&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am Madanamanjar&iacute;, the daughter of Dundubhi
the king of the Yakshas, and the wife of Ma&#7751;ibhadra the brother
of Kuvera. I used always to roam about happily with my husband on the
banks of rivers, on hills, and in charming groves.</p>
<p>And one day I went with my beloved to a garden in Ujjayin&iacute;
called Makaranda to amuse myself. There it happened that in the dawn a
low hypocritical scoundrel of a <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16017src" href="#xd27e16017" name="xd27e16017src">1</a> saw me,
when I had just woke up from a sleep brought on by the fatigue of
roaming about. That rascal, being overcome with love, went into a
cemetery, and proceeded to try and procure me for his wife by means of
a spell, and a burnt-offering. But I by my power found out what he was
about, and informed my husband; and he told his elder brother Kuvera.
And Kuvera went and complained to Brahm&aacute;, and the holy
Brahm&aacute;, after meditating, said to him, &ldquo;It is true that
<i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i> intends to rob your brother of his wife,
for such is the power of those spells for mastering Yakshas, which he
possesses. But when she feels herself being drawn along by the spell,
she must invoke the protection of king Vikram&aacute;ditya; he will
save her from him.&rdquo; Then Kuvera came and told this answer of
Brahm&aacute;&rsquo;s to my husband, and my husband told it to me,
whose mind was troubled by that wicked spell.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile that hypocritical <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, offering a burnt-offering in the
cemetery, began to draw me to him by means of a spell, duly muttered in
a circle. And I, being drawn by that spell, reached in an agony of
terror that awful cemetery, full of bones and skulls, haunted by
demons. And then I saw there that wicked <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>: he had made an offering to the
fire, and he had in a circle a corpse lying on its back, which he had
been worshipping. And that <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, when he saw that I had arrived,
was beside himself with pride, and with difficulty tore himself away to
rinse his mouth in a river, which happened to be near.</p>
<p>At that moment I called to mind what Brahm&aacute; had said, and I
thought, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572" name=
"pb572">572</a>]</span>&ldquo;Why should I not call to the king for
aid? He may be roaming about in the darkness somewhere near.&rdquo;
When I had said this to myself, I called aloud for his help in the
following words, &ldquo;Deliver me, noble king Vikram&aacute;ditya!
See, protecting talisman of the world, this <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i> is bent on outraging by force, in
your realm, me a chaste matron, the Yaksh&iacute; Madanamanjar&iacute;
by name, the daughter of Dundubhi, and the wife of Ma&#7751;ibhadra the
younger brother of Kuvera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had I finished this plaintive appeal, than I saw that king
coming towards me, sword in hand; he seemed to be all resplendent with
brightness of valour, and he said to me, &ldquo;My good lady, do not
fear; be at ease; I will deliver you from that <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, fair one. For who is able to work
such unrighteousness in my realm?&rdquo; When he had said this, he
summoned a Vet&aacute;la, named Agni&#347;ikha. And he, when summoned,
came, tall, with flaming eyes, with upstanding hair; and said to the
king, &ldquo;Tell me what I am to do.&rdquo; Then the king said,
&ldquo;Kill and eat this wicked <i lang=
"sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, who is trying to carry off his
neighbour&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; Then that Vet&aacute;la Agni&#347;ikha
entered the corpse that was in the circle of adoration, and rose up,
and rushed forward, stretching out his arms and mouth. And when the
<i lang="sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, who had come back from
rinsing his mouth, was preparing to fly, he seized him from behind by
the legs; and he whirled him round in the air and then dashed him down
with great force on the earth, and so at one blow crushed his body and
his aspirations.</p>
<p>When the demons saw the <i lang="sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>
slain, they were all eager for flesh, and a fierce Vet&aacute;la, named
Yama&#347;ikha, came there. As soon as he came, he seized the body of
the <i lang="sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>; then the first
Vet&aacute;la Agni&#347;ikha said to him, <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e16069" title="Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Hear, villain! I
have killed this <i lang="sa-latn">k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i> by the
order of king Vikram&aacute;ditya; pray what have you to do with
him?&rdquo; When Yama&#347;ikha heard that, he said to him, &ldquo;Then
tell me, what kind of power has that king?&rdquo; Then Agni&#347;ikha
said, &ldquo;If you do not know the nature of his power, listen, I will
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the gambler D&aacute;gineya, who was too
cunning for the Vet&aacute;la Agni&#347;ikha, and of
Agni&#347;ikha&rsquo;s submission to king Vikram&aacute;ditya.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once lived in this city a very resolute gambler
of the name of D&aacute;gineya. Once on a time some gamblers, by
fraudulent play, won from him all he possessed, and then bound him in
order to obtain from him the borrowed money which he had lost in
addition. And as he had nothing, they beat him with sticks and other
instruments of torture,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16080src" href=
"#xd27e16080" name="xd27e16080src">2</a> but he made himself like a
stone, and seemed as rigid as a corpse. Then all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb573" href="#pb573" name=
"pb573">573</a>]</span>those wicked gamblers took him and threw him
into a large dark well, fearing that, if he lived, he might take
vengeance on them.</p>
<p>But that gambler D&aacute;gineya, when flung down into that very
deep well, saw in front of him two great and terrible men. But they,
when they saw him fall down terrified, said to him kindly, &ldquo;Who
are you, and how have you managed to fall into this deep well? Tell
us!&rdquo; Then the gambler recovered his spirits, and told them his
story, and said to them &ldquo;Do you also tell me who you are and
whence you come.&rdquo; When those men, who were in the pit, heard
that, they said, &ldquo;Good Sir, we were Br&aacute;hman
demons<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16102src" href="#xd27e16102" name=
"xd27e16102src">3</a> dwelling in the cemetery belonging to this city,
and we possessed two maidens in this very city; one was the daughter of
the principal minister, the other of the chief merchant. And no
conjurer on the earth, however powerful his spells, was able to deliver
those maidens from us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then king Vikram&aacute;ditya, who had an affection for their
fathers, heard of it, and came to the place, where those maidens were
with a friend of their fathers&rsquo;. The moment we saw the king, we
left the maidens, and tried to escape, but we were not able to do so,
though we tried our utmost. We saw the whole horizon on fire with his
splendour. Then that king, seeing us, bound us by his power. And seeing
us unhappy, as we were afraid of being put to death, he gave us this
order, &lsquo;Ye wicked ones, dwell for a year in a dark pit, and then
ye shall be set at liberty. But when freed, ye must never again commit
such a crime; if ye do, I will punish you with destruction.&rsquo;
After king Vishama&#347;&iacute;la had given us this order, he had us
flung into this dark pit; but out of mercy he did not destroy us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in eight more days the year will be completed, and with
it the period during which we were to dwell in this cave, and we shall
then be released from it. Now, friend, if you engage to supply us with
some food during those days, we will lift you out of this pit, and set
you down outside it; but if you do not, when lifted out, supply us with
food according to your engagement, we will certainly, when we come out,
devour you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman demons made this proposal to the gambler, he
consented to it, and they put him out of the pit. When he got out of
it, he went to the cemetery at night to deal in human flesh, as he saw
no other chance of getting what he wanted. And I, happening to be there
at that time, saw that gambler, who was crying out, &ldquo;I have human
flesh for sale; buy it somebody.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;I will take
it off your hands; what price do you want for it?&rdquo; And he
answered, &ldquo;Give me your shape and power.&rdquo; Then I said again
to him, &ldquo;My fine fellow, what will you do with them?&rdquo; The
gambler then told me his whole story, and said to me, &ldquo;By means
of your shape and power I will get hold of those enemies of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb574" href="#pb574" name=
"pb574">574</a>]</span>mine, the gamblers, together with the keeper of
the gambling-house, and will give them to the Br&aacute;hman demons to
eat.&rdquo; When I heard that, I was pleased with the resolute spirit
of that gambler, and gave him my shape and my power for a specified
period of seven days. And by means of them he drew those men that had
injured him into his power, one after another, and flung them into the
pit, and fed the Br&aacute;hman demons on them during seven days.</p>
<p>Then I took back from him my shape and power, and that gambler
D&aacute;gineya, beside himself with fear, said to me, &ldquo;I have
not given those Br&aacute;hman demons any food this day, which is the
eighth, so they will now come out and devour me. Tell me what I must do
in this case, for you are my friend.&rdquo; When he said this, I,
having got to like him from being thrown with him, said to him,
&ldquo;If this is the case, since you have made those two demons devour
the gamblers, I for your sake will in turn eat the demons. So shew them
to me, my friend.&rdquo; When I made the gambler this offer, he at once
jumped at it, and took me to the pit where the demons were.</p>
<p>I, suspecting nothing, bent my head down to look into the pit, and
while I was thus engaged, the gambler put his hand on the back of my
neck, and pushed me into it. When I fell into it, the demons took me
for some one sent for them to eat, and laid hold of me, and I had a
wrestling-match with them. When they found that they could not overcome
the might of my arms, they desisted from the struggle, and asked me who
I was.</p>
<p>Then I told them my own story from the point where my fortunes
became involved with those of D&aacute;gineya,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16119src" href="#xd27e16119" name="xd27e16119src">4</a> and they
made friends with me, and said to me, &ldquo;Alas! What a trick that
evil-minded gambler has played you, and us two, and those other
gamblers! But what confidence can be placed in gamblers, who profess
exclusively the science of cheating, whose minds are proof against
friendship, pity, and gratitude for a benefit received? Recklessness
and disregard of all ties are ingrained in the nature of gamblers; hear
in illustration of this the story of
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la
the bold gambler.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in this very city of
Ujjayin&iacute; a ruffianly gambler, who was rightly named
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16127src" href="#xd27e16127" name="xd27e16127src">5</a> He lost
perpetually, and the others, who won in the game, used to give him
every day a hundred <i>cowries</i>. With those he bought wheat-flour
from the market, and in the evening made cakes by kneading them
somewhere or other in a pot with water, and then he went and cooked
them in the flame of a funeral pyre in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb575" href="#pb575" name=
"pb575">575</a>]</span>cemetery, and ate them in front of
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, smearing them with the grease from the lamp
burning before him: and he always slept at night on the ground in the
court of the same god&rsquo;s temple, pillowing his head on his
arm.</p>
<p>Now, one night, he saw the images of all the Mothers and of the
Yakshas and other divine beings in the temple of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la
trembling from the proximity of spells, and this thought arose in his
bosom, &ldquo;Why should I not employ an artful device here to obtain
wealth? If it succeeds, well and good; if it does not succeed, wherein
am I the worse?&rdquo; When he had gone through these reflections, he
challenged those deities to play, saying to them, &ldquo;Come now, I
will have a game with you, and I will act as keeper of the
gaming-table, and will fling the dice; and mind, you must always pay up
what you lose.&rdquo; When he said this to the deities they remained
silent; so &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la staked some
spotted <i>cowries</i>, and flung the dice. For this is the universally
accepted rule among gamblers, that, if a gambler does not object to the
dice being thrown, he agrees to play.</p>
<p>Then, having won much gold, he said to the deities, &ldquo;Pay me
the money I have won, as you agreed to do.&rdquo; But though the
gambler said this to the deities over and over again, they made no
answer. Then he flew in a passion and said to them, &ldquo;If you
remain silent, I will adopt with you the same course as is usually
adopted with a gambler, who will not pay the money he has lost, but
makes himself as stiff as a stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16142src"
href="#xd27e16142" name="xd27e16142src">6</a> I will simply saw through
your limbs with a saw as sharp as the points of Yama&rsquo;s teeth, for
I have no respect for anything.&rdquo; When he had said this, he ran
towards them, saw in hand; and the deities immediately paid him the
gold he had won. Next morning he lost it all at play, and in the
evening he came back again, and extorted more money from the Mothers in
the same way by making them play with him.</p>
<p>He went on doing this every day, and those deities, the Mothers,
were in very low spirits about it; then the goddess <span class="corr"
id="xd27e16147" title=
"Source: Chamu&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;">Ch&aacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;</span>
said to them, &ldquo;Whoever, when invited to gamble, says &lsquo;I sit
out of this game&rsquo; cannot be forced to play; this is the universal
convention among gamblers, ye Mother deities. So when he invites you,
say this to him, and so baffle him.&rdquo; When
Ch&aacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;&aacute; had said this to the Mothers, they
laid her advice up in their minds. And when the gambler came at night
and invited them to play with him, all the goddesses said with one
accord &ldquo;We sit out of this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la had been thus
repulsed by those goddesses, he invited their sovereign
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la himself to play. But that god, thinking that the
fellow had taken this opportunity of trying to force him to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb576" href="#pb576" name=
"pb576">576</a>]</span>gamble, said, &ldquo;I sit out of this
game.&rdquo; Even gods, you see, like feeble persons, are afraid of a
thoroughly self-indulgent, ruffianly scoundrel, flushed with
impunity.</p>
<p>Then that &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, being
depressed at finding his gambler&rsquo;s artifice baffled by a
knowledge of the etiquette of play, was disgusted, and said to himself,
&ldquo;Alas! I am baffled by these deities through their learning the
conventions of gamblers; so I must now flee for refuge to this very
sovereign of the gods.&rdquo; Having formed this resolution in his
heart, &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la embraced the feet
of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, and praising him, addressed to him the
following petition; &ldquo;I adore thee that sittest naked<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e16156src" href="#xd27e16156" name=
"xd27e16156src">7</a> with thy head resting on thy knee; thy moon, thy
bull, and thy elephant-skin having been won at play by Dev&iacute;.
When the gods give all powers at thy mere desire, and when thou art
free from longings, having for thy only possessions the matted lock,
the ashes and the skull, how canst thou suddenly have become avaricious
with regard to hapless me, in that thou desirest to disappoint me for
so small a gain? Of a truth the wishing-tree no longer gratifies the
hope of the poor, as thou dost not support me, lord Bhairava, though
thou supportest the world. So, as I have fled to thee as a suppliant,
holy Sth&aacute;&#7751;u, with my mind pierced with grievous woe, thou
oughtest even to pardon presumption in me. Thou hast three eyes, I have
three dice,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16184src" href="#xd27e16184"
name="xd27e16184src">8</a> so I am like thee in one respect; thou hast
ashes on thy body, so have I; thou eatest from a skull, so do I; shew
me mercy. When I have conversed with you gods, how can I afterwards
bear to converse with gamblers? So deliver me from my
calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this and similar utterances the gambler praised that Bhairava,
until at last the god was pleased, and manifesting himself, said to
him, &ldquo;&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, I am pleased
with thee; do not be despondent. Remain here with me; I will provide
thee with enjoyments.&rdquo; In accordance with this command of the
god&rsquo;s that gambler remained there, enjoying all kinds of luxuries
provided by the favour of the deity.</p>
<p>Now, one night, the god saw certain Apsarases, that had come to
bathe in that holy pool of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, and he gave this
command to &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, &ldquo;While
all these nymphs of heaven are engaged in bathing, quickly snatch up
the clothes, which they have laid on the bank, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb577" href="#pb577" name=
"pb577">577</a>]</span>bring them here; and do not give them back their
garments, until they surrender to you this young nymph, named
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16195src"
href="#xd27e16195" name="xd27e16195src">9</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;When &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la had
received this command from Bhairava, he went and carried off the
garments of those heavenly beauties, while they were bathing; and they
said to him, &ldquo;Give us back our garments, please; do not leave us
naked.&rdquo; But he answered them, confident in the power which
&#346;iva gave, &ldquo;If you will give me the young nymph
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, I will give you back these garments, but not
otherwise.&rdquo; When they heard that, seeing that he was a stubborn
fellow to deal with, and remembering that Indra had pronounced a curse
of this kind upon Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, they agreed to his demand.
And on his giving back the garments, they bestowed on him, in due form,
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; the daughter of Alambush&aacute;.</p>
<p>Then the Apsarases departed, and
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la remained there with that
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; in a house built by the wish of &#346;iva. And
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; went in the day to heaven to attend upon the
king of the gods, but at night she always returned<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e16202src" href="#xd27e16202" name="xd27e16202src">10</a> to
her husband. And one day she said to him in the ardour of her
affection, &ldquo;My dear, the curse of &#346;iva, which enabled me to
obtain you for a husband, has really proved a blessing.&rdquo;
Thereupon her husband &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la
asked her the cause of the curse, and the nymph Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;
thus answered him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, when I had seen the gods in a garden, I praised the
enjoyments of mortals, depreciating the pleasures of the dwellers in
heaven, as giving joys that consist only in seeing.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e16213src" href="#xd27e16213" name="xd27e16213src">11</a> When
the king of the gods heard that, he cursed me, saying, &lsquo;Thou
shalt go and be married by a mortal, and enjoy those human
pleasures.&rsquo; In this way has come about our union that is mutually
agreeable. And to-morrow I shall return to heaven after a long absence;
do not be unhappy about it; for Rambh&aacute; is going to dance a new
piece before Vish&#7751;u, and I must remain there, my beloved, until
the exhibition is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, whom love had
made like a spoiled child, said to her, &ldquo;I will go there and look
at that dance unperceived, take me there.&rdquo; When
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; heard that, she said, &ldquo;How is it fitting
for me to do this? The king of the gods might be angry, if he found it
out.&rdquo; Though she said this to him, he continued to press her;
then out of love she agreed to take him there.</p>
<p>So the next morning Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; by her power concealed
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la in a lotus, which she
placed as an ornament in her ear, and took him to the palace of Indra.
When &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la saw that palace, the
doors of which were adorned by the elephant of the gods, which was set
off by the garden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb578" href="#pb578"
name="pb578">578</a>]</span>of Nandana, he thought himself a god, and
was highly delighted. And in the court of Indra, frequented by gods, he
beheld the strange and delightful spectacle of Rambh&aacute;&rsquo;s
dance, accompanied by the singing of all the nymphs of heaven. And he
heard all the musical instruments played by N&aacute;rada and the other
minstrels; for what is hard to obtain in this world if the supreme
god<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16225src" href="#xd27e16225" name=
"xd27e16225src">12</a> is favourable to one?</p>
<p>Then, at the end of the exhibition a mime, in the shape of a divine
goat, rose up, and began to dance with heavenly<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16232src" href="#xd27e16232" name="xd27e16232src">13</a>
movements. And &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, when he
saw him, recognized him, and said to himself, &ldquo;Why, I see this
goat in Ujjayin&iacute;, figuring as a mere animal, and here he is
dancing as a mime before Indra. Of a truth this must be some strange
incomprehensible heavenly delusion.&rdquo; While
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la was going through these
reflections in his mind, the dance of the goat-mime came to an end, and
then Indra returned to his own place. And then Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;,
in high spirits, also took back
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la to his own home,
concealed in the lotus-ornament of her ear.</p>
<p>And the next day &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la
beheld in Ujjayin&iacute; that goat-formed mime of the gods, who had
returned there, and he insolently said to him, &ldquo;Come, dance
before me, as you dance before Indra. If you do not, I shall be angry
with you; show off your dancing powers, you mime.&rdquo; When the goat
heard this, he was astonished, and remained silent, saying to himself,
&ldquo;How can this mere mortal know so much about me?&rdquo; But when,
in spite of persistent entreaties, the goat refused to dance,
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la beat him on the head with
sticks.</p>
<p>Then the goat went with bleeding head to Indra, and told him all
that had taken place. And Indra by his supernatural powers of
contemplation discovered the whole secret, how Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;
had brought &#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la to heaven
when Rambh&aacute; was dancing, and how that profane fellow had there
seen the goat dancing. Then Indra summoned Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, and
pronounced on her the following curse, &ldquo;Since, out of love, thou
didst secretly bring here the man who has reduced the goat to this
state, to make him dance, depart and become an image on a pillar in the
temple built by king Narasinha in the city of
N&aacute;gapura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Indra had said this, Alambush&aacute;, the mother of
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, tried to appease him, and at last he was with
difficulty appeased, and he thus fixed an end to the curse, &ldquo;When
that temple, which it has taken many years to complete, shall perish
and be levelled with the ground, then shall her curse come to an
end.&rdquo; So Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; came weeping and told to
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la the curse Indra had
pronounced, together with the end he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb579" href="#pb579" name="pb579">579</a>]</span>appointed to it, and
how he himself was to blame, and then, after giving him her ornaments,
she entered into an image on the front of a pillar in the temple in
N&aacute;gapura.</p>
<p>&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la for his part, smitten
with the poison of separation from her, could neither hear nor see, but
rolled swooning on the ground. And when that gambler came to his
senses, he uttered this lament, &ldquo;Alas! fool that I was, I
revealed the secret, though I knew better all the time; for how can
people like myself, who are by nature thoughtless, shew self-restraint?
So now this intolerable separation has fallen to my lot.&rdquo; However
in a moment he said to himself, &ldquo;This is no time for me to
despond; why should I not recover firmness and strive to put an end to
her curse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After going through these reflections, the cunning fellow thought
carefully over the matter, and <span class="corr" id="xd27e16253"
title="Source: asuming">assuming</span> the dress of a mendicant
devotee, went with rosary, antelope-skin, and matted hair, to
N&aacute;gapura. There he secretly buried in a forest outside the city,
four pitchers containing his wife&rsquo;s ornaments, one towards each
of the cardinal points; and one full of sets of the five precious
things<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16256src" href="#xd27e16256" name=
"xd27e16256src">14</a> he deliberately buried within the city, in the
earth of the market-place, in front of the god himself.</p>
<p>When he had done this, he built a hut on the bank of the river, and
remained there, affecting a hypocritical asceticism, pretending to be
meditating and muttering. And by bathing three times in the day, and
eating only the food given him as alms, after washing it with water on
a stone, he acquired the character of a very holy man.</p>
<p>In course of time his fame reached the ears of the king, and the
king often invited him, but he never went near him: so the king came to
see him, and remained a long time in conversation with him. And in the
evening, when the king was preparing to depart, a female jackal
suddenly uttered a yell at a distance. When the cunning gambler, who
was passing himself off as an ascetic, heard that, he laughed. And when
the king asked him the meaning of the laugh, he said, &ldquo;Oh! never
mind.&rdquo; But when the king went on persistently questioning him,
the deceitful fellow said, &ldquo;In the forest to the east of this
city, under a <i>ratan</i>, there is a pitcher full of jewelled
ornaments; so take it. This, king, is what that female jackal told me,
for I understand the language of animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king was full of curiosity: so the ascetic took him to the
spot, and dug up the earth, and took out that pitcher, and gave it to
him. Then the king, having obtained the ornaments, began to have faith
in the ascetic, and considered that he not only possessed supernatural
knowledge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb580" href="#pb580" name=
"pb580">580</a>]</span>but was a truthful and unselfish devotee. So he
conducted him to his cell, and prostrated himself at his feet again and
again, and returned to his palace at night with his ministers, praising
his virtues.</p>
<p>In the same way, when the king again came to him, the ascetic
pretended to understand the cry of an animal, and in this way made over
to the king the other three pitchers, buried towards the other three
cardinal points. Then the king, and the citizens, and the king&rsquo;s
wives became exclusively devoted to the ascetic, and were, so to speak,
quite absorbed in him.</p>
<p>Now, one day, the king took that wicked ascetic to the temple for a
moment; so he contrived to hear in the market-place the cry of a crow.
Then he said to the king, &ldquo;Did you hear what the crow said?
&lsquo;In this very market-place there is a pitcher full of valuable
jewels buried in front of the god: why do you not take it up
also?&rsquo; This was the meaning of his cry; so come, and take
possession of it.&rdquo; When the deceitful ascetic had said this, he
conducted him there, and took up out of the earth the pitcher full of
valuable jewels, and gave it to the king. Then the king, in his
excessive satisfaction, entered the temple holding that pretended seer
by the hand.</p>
<p>There the mendicant brushed against that image on the pillar, which
his beloved Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; had entered, and saw her. And
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, wearing the form of the image on the pillar,
was afflicted when she saw her husband, and began to weep then and
there. When the king and his attendants saw this, they were amazed, and
cast down, and said to that pretended seer, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, what
is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Then the cunning rascal, pretending to
be despondent and bewildered, said to the king, &ldquo;Come to your
palace: there I will tell you this secret, though it is almost too
terrible to be revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, he led the king to the palace, and said to
him, &ldquo;Since you built this temple on an unlucky spot and in an
inauspicious moment, on the third day from now a misfortune will befall
you. It was for this reason that the image on the pillar wept when she
saw you. So, if you care for your body&rsquo;s weal, my sovereign, take
this into consideration, and this very day quickly level this temple
with the earth; and build another temple somewhere else, on a lucky
spot, and in an auspicious moment. Let the evil omen be averted, and
ensure the prosperity of yourself and your kingdom.&rdquo; When he had
said this to the king, he, in his terror, gave command to his subjects,
and in one day levelled that temple with the earth, and he began to
build another temple in another place. So true is it that rogues with
their tricks gain the confidence of princes, and impose upon them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the gambler
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la, having gained his

and went to Ujjayin&iacute;. And Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, finding it
out, went to meet him on the road, freed from her curse and happy, and
she comforted him, and then went to heaven to visit Indra. And Indra
was astonished, but when he heard from her mouth the artifice of her
husband the gambler, he laughed and was highly delighted. Then
V&#7771;ihaspati, who was at his side, said to Indra, &ldquo;Gamblers
are always like this, abounding in every kind of trickery.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the gambler who cheated Yama.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e16286src" href="#xd27e16286" name=
"xd27e16286src">15</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For instance, in a previous <i>kalpa</i> there was in
a certain city a gambler, of the name of
Ku&#7789;&#7789;an&iacute;kapa&#7789;a, accomplished in dishonest play.
When he went to the other world, Indra said to him, &ldquo;Gambler, you
will have to live a <i>kalpa</i> in hell on account of your crimes, but
owing to your charity you are to be Indra for one day, for once on a
time you gave a gold coin to a knower of the Supreme Soul. So say,
whether you will take out first your period in hell or your period as
Indra.&rdquo; When the gambler heard that, be said, &ldquo;I will take
out first my period as Indra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Yama sent the gambler to heaven, and the gods deposed Indra for
a day, and crowned him sovereign in his stead. He, having obtained
sovereign sway, summoned to heaven the gamblers his friends and his
female favourites, and in virtue of his regal authority gave this order
to the gods, &ldquo;Carry us all in a moment to all the holy
bathing-places,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16298src" href="#xd27e16298"
name="xd27e16298src">16</a> those in heaven, and those on earth, and
those in the seven <i>dv&iacute;pas</i>: and enter this very day into
all the kings on the earth, and bestow without ceasing, great, gifts
for our benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he gave this order to the gods, they did everything as he had
desired, and by means of those holy observances his sins were
washed<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16312src" href="#xd27e16312" name=
"xd27e16312src">17</a> away, and he obtained the rank of Indra
permanently. And by his favour his friends and his female favourites,
that he had summoned to heaven, had their sins destroyed and obtained
immortality. The next day Chitragupta informed Yama that the gambler
had by his discretion obtained the rank of Indra permanently. Then
Yama, hearing of his meritorious actions, was astonished, and said,
&ldquo;Dear me! this gambler has cheated us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When V&#7771;ihaspati had told this story, he said, &ldquo;Such, O
wielder of the thunderbolt, are gamblers,&rdquo; and then held his
peace. And then Indra sent Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; to summon
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la to heaven. There the king
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb582" href="#pb582" name=
"pb582">582</a>]</span>gods, pleased with his cleverness and
resolution, honoured him, and gave him Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; to wife,
and made him an attendant on himself. Then the brave
&#7788;hi&#7751;&#7789;h&aacute;kar&aacute;la lived happily, like a
god, in heaven, with Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, by the favour of
&#346;iva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, such is the style in which gamblers exhibit
their treachery and audacity; accordingly Agni&#347;ikha the Vampire,
what is there to be surprised at in your having been treacherously
thrown into this well by D&aacute;gineya the gambler? So come out of
this pit, friend, and we will come out also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman demons said this to me, I came up out of
that pit, and being hungry, I came across a Br&aacute;hman traveller
that night in the city. So I rushed forward and seized that
Br&aacute;hman to eat him, but he invoked the protection of king
Vikram&aacute;ditya. And the moment the king heard his cry, he rushed
out like flame, and while still at a distance, checked me by exclaiming
&ldquo;Ah villain! do not kill the Br&aacute;hman:&rdquo; and then he
proceeded to cut off the head of a figure of a man he had drawn; that
did not sever my neck, but made it stream with blood.</p>
<p>Then I left the Br&aacute;hman and clung to the king&rsquo;s feet,
and he spared my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the power of that god, king Vikram&aacute;ditya. And
it is by his orders that I have slain this hypocritical
<i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>. So he is my proper prey, to be devoured
by me as being a Vet&aacute;la; let him go, Yama&#347;ikha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Agni&#347;ikha made this appeal to Yama&#347;ikha, the latter
proceeded contumaciously to drag with his hand the corpse of that
hypocritical <i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>. Then king
Vikram&aacute;ditya appeared there, and drew the figure of a man on the
earth and then cut off its hand with his sword. That made the hand of
Yama&#347;ikha fall severed; so he left the corpse, and fled in fear.
And Agni&#347;ikha immediately devoured the corpse of that
<i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>. And I witnessed all this, securely
protected by the might of the king.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16350src" href="#xd27e16350" name="xd27e16350src">18</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In these words did that wife of the Yaksha,
Madanamanjar&iacute; by name, describe your power, O king, and then she
went on to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Anangadeva, the king said to me in a gentle voice,
&ldquo;Yaksh&iacute;, being delivered from the
<i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, go to the house of your husband.&rdquo;
Then I bowed before him, and returned to this my own home, thinking how
I might repay to that king the benefit he had conferred on me. In this
way your master gave me life, family and husband; and when you tell him
this story of mine, it will agree with his own recollections.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have to-day found out that the king of Sinhala has sent
to that king his daughter, the greatest beauty in the three worlds, who
has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb583" href="#pb583" name=
"pb583">583</a>]</span>of her own accord elected to marry him. And all
the kings, being jealous, have gathered themselves together and formed
the intention of killing Vikrama&#347;akti, and the dependent
kings,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16374src" href="#xd27e16374" name=
"xd27e16374src">19</a> and of carrying off that maiden. So, do you go,
and make known that their intention to Vikrama&#347;akti, in order that
he may be on his guard and ready to repel their attack. And I will
exert myself to enable king Vikram&aacute;ditya to conquer those
enemies and gain the victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason I brought you here by my own deluding power,
in order that you might tell all this to king Vikrama&#347;akti and the
dependent monarchs; and I will send to your sovereign such a present as
shall to a certain small extent be a requital for the benefit that he
conferred on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was saying this, the two maidens, that we had seen in the
sea, came there with the deer; one had a body white as the moon, the
other was dark as a <i>priyangu</i>; so they seemed like Gang&aacute;
and Yamun&aacute; returned from worshipping the ocean, the monarch of
rivers. When they had sat down, I put this question to the
Yaksh&iacute;, &ldquo;Goddess, who are these maidens, and what is the
meaning of this golden deer?&rdquo; When the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;
heard this, king, she said to me, &ldquo;Anangadeva, if you feel any
curiosity about the matter, listen, I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Long ago there came to impede Praj&aacute;pati, in his
creation of creatures, two terrible D&aacute;navas, named
Gha&#7751;&#7789;a and Nigha&#7751;&#7789;a, invincible even by gods.
And the Creator, being desirous of destroying them, created these two
maidens, the splendour of whose measureless beauty seemed capable of
maddening the world. And those two mighty Asuras, when they saw these
two exceedingly wonderful maidens, tried to carry them off; and
fighting with one another, they both of them met their death.<a class=

<p>Then Brahm&aacute; bestowed these maidens on Kuvera, saying,

<h3 class="main">Story of the golden deer.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Indra has a beloved son, named Jayanta. Once on a
time, when he, still an infant, was being carried about in the air by
the celestial nymphs, he saw some princes in a wood on earth playing
with some young deer. Then Jayanta<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16421src"
href="#xd27e16421" name="xd27e16421src">22</a> went to heaven, and
cried in the presence of his father because he had not got a deer to
play with, as a child would naturally do. Accordingly Indra had a deer
made for him by Vi&#347;vakarman of gold and jewels, and life was given
to the animal by sprinkling it with nectar. Then Jayanta played with
it, and was delighted with it, and the young deer was continually
roaming about in heaven.</p>
<p>In course of time that son of R&aacute;va&#7751;a, who was rightly
named Indrajit,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16437src" href="#xd27e16437"
name="xd27e16437src">23</a> carried off the young deer from heaven and
took it to his own city Lank&aacute;. And after a further period had
elapsed, R&aacute;va&#7751;a and Indrajit having been slain by the
heroes R&aacute;ma and Lakshma&#7751;a, to avenge the carrying off of
S&iacute;t&aacute;, and Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a having been set upon
the throne of Lank&aacute;, as king of the R&aacute;kshasas, that
wonderful deer of gold and jewels remained in his palace. And once on a
time, when I was taken by my husband&rsquo;s relations to
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a&rsquo;s palace on the occasion of a festival,
he gave me the deer as a complimentary present. And that young
heaven-born deer is now in my house, and I must bestow it on your
master.</p>
<p>And while the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; was telling me this string of
tales, the sun, the friend of the <i>kamalin&iacute;</i>, went to rest.
Then I and the ambassador of the king of Sinhala went to sleep, both of
us, after the evening ceremonies, in a palace which the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; assigned to us.</p>
<p>In the morning we woke up and saw, my sovereign, that the army of
Vikrama&#347;akti, your vassal, had arrived. We reflected that that
must be a display of the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;&rsquo;s power, and
quickly went wondering into the presence of Vikrama&#347;akti. And he,
as soon as he saw us, showed us great honour, and asked after our
welfare; and was on the point of asking us what message the king of
Sinhala had sent, when the two heavenly maidens, whose history the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; had related to us, and the young deer arrived
there, escorted by the army of the Yakshas. When king Vikrama&#347;akti
saw this, he suspected some glamour of malignant demons, and he said to
me apprehensively &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Then I
told him in due course the commission of the king of Sinhala, and the
circumstances connected with the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, the two
maidens, and the deer. Moreover I informed him of the hostile scheme of
your majesty&rsquo;s enemies, which was to be carried out by all the
kings in combination, and which I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb585"
href="#pb585" name="pb585">585</a>]</span>had heard of from the
Yaksh&iacute;. Then Vikrama&#347;akti honoured us two ambassadors, and
those two heavenly maidens; and being delighted made his army ready for
battle with the assistance of the other vassal kings.</p>
<p>And immediately, king, there was heard in the army the loud beating
of drums, and immediately there was seen the mighty host of hostile
kings, accompanied by the Mlechchhas. Then our army and the hostile
army, furious at beholding one another, closed with a rush, and the
battle began. Thereupon some of the Yakshas sent by the Yaksh&iacute;
entered our soldiers, and so smote the army of the enemies, and others
smote them in open fight.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16453src" href=
"#xd27e16453" name="xd27e16453src">24</a> And there arose a terrible
tempest of battle, overspread with a cloud formed of the dust raised by
the army, in which sword-blades fell thick as rain, and the shouts of
heroes thundered. And the heads of our enemies flying up, as they were
cut off, and falling again, made it seem as if the Fortune of our
victory were playing at ball. And in a moment those kings that had
escaped the slaughter, their troops having been routed, submitted and
repaired for protection to the camp of your vassal.</p>
<p>Then, lord of earth, as you had conquered the four cardinal points
and the <i>dv&iacute;pas</i>, and had destroyed all the Mlechchhas,
that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; appeared, accompanied by her husband, and
said to king Vikrama&#347;akti and to me, &ldquo;You must tell your
master that what I have done has been done merely by way of service to
him, and you must also request him, as from me, to marry these two
god-framed maidens, and to look upon them with favour, and to cherish
this deer also, for it is a present from me.&rdquo; When the
Yaksh&iacute; had said this, she bestowed a heap of jewels, and
disappeared with her husband, and her attendants. The next day,
Madanalekh&aacute;, the daughter of the king of Sinhala, came with a
great retinue and much magnificence. And then Vikrama&#347;akti went to
meet her, and bending low, joyfully conducted her into his camp. And on
the second day Vikrama&#347;akti, having accomplished his object, set
out with the other kings from that place, in order to come here and
behold your Majesty&rsquo;s feet, bringing with him that princess and
the two heavenly maidens, and that deer composed of gold and jewels, a
marvel for the eyes of the three worlds. And now, sovereign, that
vassal prince has arrived near this city, and has sent us two on in
front to inform Your Highness. So let the king, out of regard for the
lord of Sinhala and the Yaksh&iacute;, go forth to meet those maidens
and the deer, and also the subject kings.</p>
<p>When Anangadeva had said this to king Vikram&aacute;ditya, though
the king recollected accomplishing that difficult rescue of the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, he did not consider it worth a straw, when he
heard of the return she had made for it; great-souled men, even when
they have done much, think it worth <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb586" href="#pb586" name="pb586">586</a>]</span>very little. And,
being much pleased, he loaded<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16471src"
href="#xd27e16471" name="xd27e16471src">25</a> Anangadeva for the
second time, with elephants, horses, villages, and jewels, and bestowed
similar gifts on the ambassador of the king of Sinhala.</p>
<p>And after he had spent that day, the king set out from
Ujjayin&iacute;, with his warriors mounted on elephants and horses, to
meet that daughter of the king of Sinhala, and those two maidens
created by Brahm&aacute;. And the following speeches of the military
officers, assigning elephants and horses, were heard in the
neighbourhood of the city when the kings started, and within the city
itself when the sovereign started; &ldquo;Jayavardhana must take the
good elephant Anangagiri, and Ra&#7751;abha&#7789;a the furious
elephant K&aacute;lamegha, and Sinhapar&aacute;krama
Sangr&aacute;masiddhi, and the hero Vikramanidhi Ripur&aacute;kshasa,
and Jayaketu Pavanajava, and Vallabha&#347;akti Samudrakallola, and
B&aacute;hu and Sub&aacute;hu the two horses &#346;aravega and
Garu&#7693;avega, and K&iacute;rtivarman the black Konkan mare
Kuvalayam&aacute;l&aacute;, and Samarasinha the white mare
Gang&aacute;lahar&iacute; of pure Sindh breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that king, the supreme sovereign of all the
<i>dv&iacute;pas</i>, had started on his journey, the earth was covered
with soldiers, the quarters were full of nothing but the shouts that
they raised, even the heaven was obscured with the dust that was
diffused by the trampling of his advancing army, and all men&rsquo;s
voices were telling of the wonderful greatness of his might.</p>

<p class="first">Then king Vikram&aacute;ditya reached that victorious
army commanded by that Vikrama&#347;akti his general, and he entered it
at the head of his forces, accompanied by that general, who came to
meet him, eager and with loyal mind, together with the vassal
kings.</p>
<p>The kings were thus announced by the warders in the tent of
assembly, &ldquo;Your Majesty, here is &#346;aktikum&aacute;ra the king
of Gau&#7693;a come to pay you his respects, here is Jayadhvaja the
king of Kar&#7751;&aacute;&#7789;a, here is Vijayavarman of
L&aacute;&#7789;a, here is Sunandana of Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra, here is
Gop&aacute;la king of Sindh, here is Vindhyabala the Bhilla, and here
is Nirm&uacute;ka the king of the Persians.&rdquo; And when they had
been thus announced, the king honoured them, and the feudal chiefs, and
also the soldiers. And he welcomed in appropriate fashion the daughter
of the king of Sinhala, and the heavenly maidens, and the golden deer,
and Vikrama&#347;akti. And the next day the successful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb587" href="#pb587" name=
"pb587">587</a>]</span>monarch Vikram&aacute;ditya set out with them
and his forces, and reached the city of Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>Then, the kings having been dismissed with marks of honour<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e16495src" href="#xd27e16495" name=
"xd27e16495src">1</a> to their own territories, and the
world-gladdening festival of the spring season having arrived, when the
creepers began, so to speak, to adorn themselves with flowers for
jewels, and the female bees to keep up a concert with their humming,
and the ranges of the wood to dance embraced by the wind, and the
cuckoos with melodious notes to utter auspicious prayers, king
Vikram&aacute;ditya married on a fortunate day that daughter of the
king of Sinhala, and those two heavenly maidens. And Sinhavarman, the
eldest brother of the princess of Sinhala, who had come with her,
bestowed at the marriage-altar a great heap of jewels.</p>
<p>And at that moment the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; Madanamanjar&iacute;
appeared, and gave those two heavenly maidens countless heaps of
jewels. The Yaksh&iacute; said, &ldquo;How can I ever, king, recompense
you for your benefits? But I have done this unimportant service to
testify my devotion to you. So you must shew favour to these maidens,
and to the deer.&rdquo; When the Yaksh&iacute; had said this, she
departed honoured by the king.</p>
<p>Then the successful king Vikram&aacute;ditya, having obtained those
wives and the earth with all its <i>dv&iacute;pas</i>, ruled a realm
void of opponents; and he enjoyed himself roaming in all the garden
grounds; during the hot season living in the water of tanks and in
artificial fountain-chambers, during the rains in inner apartments
charming on account of the noise of cymbals that arose in them, during
the autumn on the tops of palaces, joyous with banquets under the
rising moon, during the winter in chambers where comfortable couches
were spread, and which were fragrant with black aloes, being ever
surrounded by his wives.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Malayavat&iacute; the man-hating maiden.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now this king, being such as I have described, had a
painter named Nagarasv&aacute;min, who enjoyed the revenues of a
hundred villages, and surpassed Vi&#347;vakarman. That painter used
every two or three days to paint a picture of a girl, and give it as a
present to the king, taking care to exemplify different types of
beauty.</p>
<p>Now, once on a time, it happened that that painter had, because a
feast was going on, forgotten to paint the required girl for the king.
And when the day for giving the present arrived, the painter remembered
and was bewildered, saying to himself, &ldquo;Alas! what can I give to
the king?&rdquo; And at that moment a traveller come from afar suddenly
approached him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb588" href="#pb588" name=
"pb588">588</a>]</span>and placed a book in his hand, and went off
somewhere quickly. The painter out of curiosity opened the book, and
saw within a picture of a girl on canvas. Inasmuch as the girl was of
wonderful beauty, no sooner did he see her picture then he took it and
gave it to the king, rejoicing that, so far from having no picture to
present that day, he had obtained such an exceedingly beautiful one.
But the king, as soon as he saw it, was astonished, and said to him,
&ldquo;My good fellow, this is not your painting, this is the painting
of Vi&#347;vakarman: for how could a mere mortal be skilful enough to
paint such beauty?&rdquo; When the painter heard this, he told the king
exactly what had taken place.</p>
<p>Then the king kept ever looking at the picture of the girl, and
never took his eyes off it, and one night he saw in a dream a girl
exactly like her, but in another <i>dv&iacute;pa</i>. But as he eagerly
rushed to embrace her, who was eager to meet him, the night came to an
end, and he was woke up by the watchman.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16525src" href="#xd27e16525" name="xd27e16525src">2</a> When the
king awoke, he was so angry at the interruption of his delightful
interview with that maiden, that he banished that watchman from the
city. And he said to himself, &ldquo;To think that a traveller should
bring a book, and that in it there should be the painted figure of a
girl, and that I should in a dream behold this same girl apparently
alive! All this elaborate dispensation of destiny makes me think that
she must be a real maiden, but I do not know in what
<i>dv&iacute;pa</i> she lives; how am I to obtain her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full of such reflections, the king took pleasure in
nothing,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16539src" href="#xd27e16539" name=
"xd27e16539src">3</a> and burnt with the fever of love so that his
attendants were full of anxiety. And the warder Bhadr&aacute;yudha
asked the afflicted king in private the cause of his grief, whereupon
he spake as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I will tell you, my friend. So much at any rate you
know, that that painter gave me the picture of a girl. And I fell
asleep thinking on her, and I remember that in my dream I crossed the
sea, and reached and entered a very beautiful city. There I saw many
armed maidens in front of me, and they, as soon as they saw me, raised
a tumultuous cry of &lsquo;Kill, kill.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16553src" href="#xd27e16553" name="xd27e16553src">4</a> Then a
certain female ascetic came and with great precipitation made me enter
her house, and briefly said to me this, &lsquo;My son, here is the
man-hating princess Malayavat&iacute; come this way, diverting herself
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb589" href="#pb589" name=
"pb589">589</a>]</span>she pleases. And the moment she sees a man, she
makes these maidens of hers kill him: so I brought you in here to save
your life.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16561src" href=
"#xd27e16561" name="xd27e16561src">5</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;When the female ascetic had said this, she immediately made
me put on female attire; and I submitted to that, knowing that it was
not lawful to slay those maidens. But, when the princess entered into
the house with her maidens, I looked at her, and lo! she was the very
lady that had been shewn me in a picture. And I said to myself,
&lsquo;Fortunate am I in that, after first seeing this lady in a
picture, I now behold her again in flesh and blood, dear as my
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile the princess, at the head of her maidens,
said to that female ascetic, &lsquo;We saw some male enter here.&rsquo;
The ascetic shewed me, and answered, &lsquo;I know of no male; here is
my sister&rsquo;s daughter, who is with me as a guest.&rsquo; Then the
princess seeing me, although I was disguised as a woman, forgot her
dislike of men, and was at once overcome by love. She remained for a
moment, with every hair on her body erect, motionless as if in thought,
being, so to speak, nailed to the spot at once with arrows by Love, who
had spied his opportunity. And in a moment the princess said to the
ascetic, &lsquo;Then, noble lady, why should not your sister&rsquo;s
daughter be my guest also? Let her come to my palace; I will send her
back duly honoured.&rsquo; Saying this, she took me by the hand, and
led me away to her palace. And I remember, I discerned her intention,
and consented, and went there, and that sly old female ascetic gave me
leave to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I remained there with that princess, who was diverting
herself with the amusement of marrying her maidens to one another, and
so forth. Her eyes were fixed on me, and she would not let me out of
her sight for an instant, and no occupation pleased her in which I did
not take part. Then those maidens, I remember, made the princess a
bride, and me her husband, and married us in sport. And when we had
been married, we entered at night the bridal chamber, and the princess
fearlessly threw her arms round my neck. And then I told her who I was,
and embraced her, and delighted at having attained her object, she
looked at me and then remained a long time with her eyes bashfully
fixed on the ground. And at that moment that villain of a watchman woke
me up. So, Bhadr&aacute;yudha, the upshot of the whole matter is that I
can no longer live without that Malayavat&iacute;, whom I have seen in
a picture and in a dream.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb590"
href="#pb590" name="pb590">590</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the king said this, the warder Bhadr&aacute;yudha perceived
that it was a true dream, and he consoled the monarch, and said to him,
&ldquo;If the king remembers it all exactly, let him draw that city on
a piece of canvas in order that some expedient may be devised in this
matter.&rdquo; The moment the king heard this suggestion of
Bhadr&aacute;yudha&rsquo;s, he proceeded to draw that splendid city on
a piece of canvas, and all the scene that took place there. Then the
warder at once took the drawing, and had a new monastery<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e16579src" href="#xd27e16579" name=
"xd27e16579src">6</a> made, and hung it up there on the wall. And he
directed that in relief-houses attached to the monastery, a quantity of
food, with pairs of garments and gold, should be given to bards coming
from distant countries. And he gave this order to the dwellers in the
monastery, &ldquo;If any one comes here, who knows the city represented
here in a picture, let me be informed of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the fierce elephant of the rainy season with
irresistible loud deep thunder-roar and long <i>ketaka</i> tusks came
down upon the forest of the heats, a forest the breezes of which were
scented with the perfume of the jasmine, in which travellers sat down
on the ground in the shade, and trumpet-flowers bloomed. At that time
the forest-fire of separation of that king Vikram&aacute;ditya began to
burn more fiercely, fanned by the eastern breeze.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16590src" href="#xd27e16590" name="xd27e16590src">7</a> Then the
following cries were heard among the ladies of his court,
&ldquo;H&aacute;ralat&aacute;, bring ice! Chitr&aacute;ng&iacute;,
sprinkle him with sandal-wood juice! Patralekh&aacute;, make a bed cool
with lotus-leaves! Kandarpasen&aacute;, fan him with
plantain-leaves!&rdquo; And in course of time the cloudy season
terrible with lightning passed away for that king, but the fever of
love burning<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16612src" href="#xd27e16612"
name="xd27e16612src">8</a> with the sorrow of separation did not pass
away.</p>
<p>Then the autumn with her open lotus-face, and smile of unclosed
flowers, came, vocal with the cries of swans,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16624src" href="#xd27e16624" name="xd27e16624src">9</a> seeming
to utter this command, &ldquo;Let travellers advance on their journey;
let pleasant tidings be brought about absent dear ones; happy may their
merry meetings be!&rdquo; On a certain day in that season a bard, who
had come from a distance, of the name of &#346;anvarasiddhi, having
heard the fame of that monastery, built by the warder, entered it to
get food. After he had been fed, and presented with a pair of garments,
he saw that painting on the wall of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb591" href="#pb591" name="pb591">591</a>]</span>monastery. When the
bard had carefully scanned the city delineated there, he was
astonished, and said, &ldquo;I wonder who can have drawn this city? For
I alone have seen it, I am certain, and no other; and here it is drawn
by some second person.&rdquo; When the inhabitants of the monastery
heard that, they told Bhadr&aacute;yudha; then he came in person, and
took that bard to the king. The king said to &#346;anvarasiddhi,
&ldquo;Have you really seen that city?&rdquo; Then &#346;anvarasiddhi
gave him the following answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was wandering about the world, I crossed the sea that
separates the <i>dv&iacute;pas</i>, and beheld that great city
Malayapura. In that city there dwells a king of the name of
Malayasinha, and he has a matchless daughter, named Malayavat&iacute;,
who used to abhor males. But one night she somehow or other saw in a
dream a great hero in a convent.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16649src"
href="#xd27e16649" name="xd27e16649src">10</a> The moment she saw him,
that evil spirit of detestation of the male sex fled from her mind, as
if terrified. Then she took him to her palace, and in her dream married
him, and entered with him the bridal chamber. And at that moment the
night came to an end, and an attendant in her room woke her up. Then
she banished that servant in her anger, and thinking upon that dear
one, whom she had seen in her dream, seeing no way of escape owing to
the blazing fire of separation, utterly overpowered by love, she never
rose from her couch except to fall back upon it again with relaxed
limbs. She was dumb, as if possessed by a demon, as if stunned by a
blow,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16667src" href="#xd27e16667" name=
"xd27e16667src">11</a> for when her attendants questioned her, she gave
them no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then her father and mother came to hear of it, and questioned
her; and at last she was, with exceeding difficulty, persuaded to tell
them what happened to her in the dream, by the mouth of a confidential
female friend. Then her father comforted her, but she made a solemn vow
that, if she did not obtain her beloved in six months, she would enter
the fire. And already five months are past; who knows what will become
of her? This is the story that I heard about her in that
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &#346;anvarasiddhi had told this story, which tallied so well
with the king&rsquo;s own dream, the king was pleased at knowing the
certainty of the matter, and Bhadr&aacute;yudha said to him, &ldquo;The
business is as good as effected, for that king and his country own your
paramount supremacy. So let us go there before the sixth month has
passed away.&rdquo; When the warder had said this, king
Vikram&aacute;ditya made him inform &#346;anvarasiddhi of all the
circumstances connected with the matter, and honoured him with a
present of much wealth, and bade him shew him the way, and then he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb592" href="#pb592" name=
"pb592">592</a>]</span>seemed to bequeath his own burning heat to the
rays of the sun, his paleness to the clouds, and his thinness to the
waters of the rivers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16685src" href=
"#xd27e16685" name="xd27e16685src">12</a> and having become free from
sorrow, set out at once, escorted by a small force, for the
dwelling-place of his beloved.</p>
<p>In course of time, as he advanced, he crossed the sea, and reached
that city, and there he saw the people in front of it engaged in loud
lamentation, and when he questioned them, he received this answer,
&ldquo;The princess Malayavat&iacute; here, as the period of six months
is at an end, and she has not obtained her beloved, is preparing to
enter the fire.&rdquo; Then the king went to the place where the pyre
had been made ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the people saw him, they made way for him, and then the
princess beheld that unexpected nectar-rain to her eyes. And she said
to her ladies-in-waiting, &ldquo;Here is that beloved come who married
me in a dream, so tell my father quickly.&rdquo; They went and told
this to her father, and then that king, delivered from his grief, and
filled with joy, submissively approached the sovereign. At that moment
the bard &#346;anvarasiddhi, who knew his time, lifted up his arm, and
chanted aloud this strain, &ldquo;Hail thou that with the flame of thy
valour hast consumed the forest of the army of demons and Mlechchhas!
Hail king, lord of the seven-sea-girt earth-bride! Hail thou that hast
imposed thy exceedingly heavy yoke on the bowed heads of all kings,
conquered by thee! Hail, Vishama&#347;&iacute;la, hail
Vikram&aacute;ditya, ocean of valour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bard said this, king Malayasinha knew that it was
Vikram&aacute;ditya himself that had come, and embraced his
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16694src" href="#xd27e16694" name=
"xd27e16694src">13</a> And after he had welcomed him, he entered his
palace with him, and his daughter Malayavat&iacute;, thus delivered
from death. And that king gave that daughter of his to king
Vikram&aacute;ditya, thinking himself fortunate in having obtained such
a son-in-law. And king Vikram&aacute;ditya, when he saw in his arms, in
flesh and blood, that Malayavat&iacute;, whom he had previously seen in
a picture and in a dream, considered it a wonderful fruit of the
wishing-tree of &#346;iva&rsquo;s favour. Then Vikram&aacute;ditya took
with him his wife Malayavat&iacute;, like an incarnation of bliss, and
crossed the sea resembling his long regretful<a class="noteref" id=

separation, and being submissively waited upon at every step by kings,
with various presents in their hands, returned to his own city
Ujjayin&iacute;. And on beholding there that might of his, that

<p class="first">Then, once on a time, in the course of conversation,
one of Vikram&aacute;ditya&rsquo;s queens, called Kalingasen&aacute;,
said to her rival queens, &ldquo;What the king did for the sake of
Malayavat&iacute; was not wonderful, for this king
Vishama&#347;&iacute;la has ever been famous on the earth for such like
acts. Was not I swooped down on by him and married by force, after he
had seen a carved likeness of me and been overcome by love? On this

<p>&ldquo;I was very much vexed, and exclaimed &lsquo;How can the king

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time, when I was serving your husband as a
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i>, I saw a great boar far away in the wood.
Its mouth was formidable with tusks, its colour was black as a
Tam&aacute;la tree, it looked like an incarnation of the black
fortnight devouring the digits of the moon. And I came, queen, and
informed the king of it, describing it to him as I have done to you.
And the king went out to hunt, attracted by his love for the sport. And
when he reached the wood, and was dealing death among the tigers and
deer, he saw in the distance that boar of which I had informed him. And
when he saw that wonderful boar, he came to the conclusion that some
being had assumed that form with an object, and he ascended his horse
called Ratn&aacute;kara, the progeny of Ucchaih&#803;&#347;ravas.</p>
<p>For every day at noon, the sun waits a brief space in the sky, and
then his charioteer the dawn lets the horses loose, that they may bathe
and feed: and one day Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas, having been unyoked
from the chariot of the sun, approached a mare of the king&rsquo;s,
that he saw in the forest, and begot that horse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16751src" href="#xd27e16751" name="xd27e16751src">2</a></p>
<p>So the king mounted that swift horse, and quickly pursued that boar,
that fled to a very remote<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16756src" href=
"#xd27e16756" name="xd27e16756src">3</a> part of the forest. Then that
boar escaped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb594" href="#pb594" name=
"pb594">594</a>]</span>somewhere from his view, being swifter even than
that horse that had Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas for a sire. Then the
king, not having caught him, and seeing that I alone had followed him,
while he had left the rest of his suite far behind, asked me this
question, &ldquo;Do you know how much ground we have traversed to get
to this place?&rdquo; When I heard that, queen, I made the king this
answer, &ldquo;My lord, we have come three hundred
<i>yojanas</i>.&rdquo; Then the king being astonished said, &ldquo;Then
how have you managed to come so far on foot?&rdquo; When he asked me
this question, I answered, &ldquo;King, I have an ointment for the
feet; hear the way in which I acquired it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">How Devasena obtained the magic ointment.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, on account of the loss of my wife, I went
forth to make a pilgrimage to all the holy bathing places, and in the
course of my journey I came one evening to a temple with a garden. And
I went in there to pass the night, and I saw inside a woman, and I
remained there hospitably welcomed by her. And during the course of the
night she elevated one lip to heaven, resting the other on the earth,
and with expanded jaws said to me, &ldquo;Have you seen before anywhere
such a mouth as this?&rdquo; Then I fearlessly drew my dagger with a
frown, and said to her, &ldquo;Have you seen such a man as this?&rdquo;
Then she assumed a gentle appearance without any horrible distortion of
shape, and said to me, &ldquo;I am a Yaksh&iacute;, Vandhy&aacute; by
name, and I am pleased with your courage; so now tell me what I can do
to gratify you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; said this, I answered her, &ldquo;If
you are really pleased with me, then enable me to go round to all the
holy waters without any suffering.&rdquo; When the Yaksh&iacute; heard
this, she gave me an ointment for my feet;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16776src" href="#xd27e16776" name="xd27e16776src">4</a> by means
of it I travelled to all the holy bathing-places, and I have been able
to run behind you now so far as this place. And by its aid I come to
this wood here every day, and eat fruits, and then return to
Ujjayin&iacute; and attend upon you.</p>
<p>When I told that tale to the king, I saw by his pleased face that he
thought in his heart that I was a follower well-suited to him. I again
said to him, &ldquo;King, I will bring you here some very sweet fruits,
if you will be pleased to eat them.&rdquo; The king said to me,
&ldquo;I will not eat; I do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb595" href=
"#pb595" name="pb595">595</a>]</span>not require anything; but do you
eat something, as you are exhausted.&rdquo; Then I got hold of a gourd
and ate it, and no sooner had I eaten it, than it turned me into a
python.</p>
<p>But king Vishama&#347;&iacute;la, when he saw me suddenly turn into
a python, was astonished and despondent. So, being there alone, he
called to mind the Vet&aacute;la Bh&uacute;taketu, whom he had long ago
made his servant, by delivering him with a look from a disease of the
eyes. That Vet&aacute;la came, as soon as the king called him to mind,
and bowing before him said, &ldquo;Why did you call me to mind, great
king? Give me your orders.&rdquo; Then the king said, &ldquo;Good sir,
this my <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> has been suddenly turned into a
python by eating a gourd; restore him to his former condition.&rdquo;
But the Vet&aacute;la said, &ldquo;King, I have not the power to do
this. Powers are strictly limited: can water quench the flame of
lightning?&rdquo; Then the king said, &ldquo;Then let us go to this
village, my friend. We may eventually hear of some remedy from the
Bhillas there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had come to this conclusion, he went to that village
with the Vet&aacute;la. There the bandits surrounded him, seeing that
he wore ornaments. But when they began to rain arrows upon him, the
Vet&aacute;la, by the order of the king, devoured five hundred of them.
The rest fled and told their chief what had occurred, and he, whose
name was Ek&aacute;kike&#347;arin, came there in wrath, with his host.
But one of his servants recognised the monarch, and the chief hearing
from him who it was, came and clung to Vikram&aacute;ditya&rsquo;s
feet, and announced himself. Then the king welcomed kindly the
submissive chief, and asked after his health, and said to him,
&ldquo;My <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> has become a python by eating
the fruit of a gourd in the forest; so devise some plan for releasing
him from his transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When that chief heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s, he said to
him, &ldquo;King, let this follower of yours shew him to my son
here.&rdquo; Then that son of his came with the Vet&aacute;la, and made
me a man as before by means of a sternutatory made of the extract of a
plant. And then we went joyful into tho presence of the king; and when
I bent at the feet of the king, the king informed the delighted chief
who I was.</p>
<p>Then the Bhilla chief Ek&aacute;kike&#347;arin, after obtaining the
king&rsquo;s consent, conducted him and us to his palace. And we beheld
that dwelling of his, crowded with &#346;avaras, having its high walls
covered with the tusks of elephants, adorned with tiger-skins; in which
the women had for garments the tails of peacocks, for necklaces strings
of <i>gunj&aacute;</i>-fruit, and for perfume the ichor that flows from
the foreheads of elephants. There the wife of the chief, having her
garments perfumed with musk, adorned with pearls and such like
ornaments, herself waited on the king.</p>
<p>Then the king, having bathed and taken a meal, observed that the
chief&rsquo;s sons were old, while he was a young man, and put this
question to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb596" href="#pb596" name=
"pb596">596</a>]</span>him, &ldquo;Chief, explain, I pray you, this
that puzzles me. How comes it, that you are a young man, whereas these
children of yours are old?&rdquo; When the king had said this to the
&#346;avara chief, he answered him, &ldquo;This<span class="corr"

feel any curiosity about it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the grateful Monkey.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16825src" href="#xd27e16825" name="xd27e16825src">5</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I was long ago a Br&aacute;hman named
Chandrasv&aacute;min, and I lived in the city of M&aacute;y&aacute;pur.
One day I went by order of my father to the forest to fetch wood. There
a monkey stood barring my way, but without hurting me, looking at me
with an eye of grief, pointing out to me another path. I said to
myself, &ldquo;This monkey does not bite me, so I had better go along
the path which he points out, and see what his object is.&rdquo;
Thereupon I set out with him along that path, and the monkey kept going
along in front of me, and turning round to look at me. And after he had
gone some distance, he climbed up <i>jambu</i>-tree, and I looked at
the upper part of the tree, which was covered with a dense network of
creepers: and I saw a female monkey there with her body fettered by a
mass of creepers twisted round her, and I understood that it was on
this account that the monkey had brought me there. Then I climbed up
the tree, and cut with my axe the creepers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16835src" href="#xd27e16835" name="xd27e16835src">6</a> that had
twisted round and entangled her, and set that female monkey at
liberty.</p>
<p>And when I got down from the tree, the male and female monkey came
down also and embraced my feet. And the male monkey left that female
clinging to my feet for a moment, and went and fetched a heavenly
fruit, and gave it to me. I took it and returned home after I had got
my fuel, and there I and my wife ate that splendid fruit together, and
as soon as we had eaten it, we ceased to be liable to old age and
disease.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16845src" href="#xd27e16845" name=
"xd27e16845src">7</a></p>
<p>Then there arose in that country of ours the scourge of famine. And
afflicted by that calamity the people of that land fled in all
directions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb597" href="#pb597" name=
"pb597">597</a>]</span>And I happened in course of time to reach this
country with my wife. And at that time there was a king of the
&#346;avaras here named K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra: I entered his
service with my sword. And as K&aacute;nchanadansh&#7789;ra saw that I
came to the front in several engagements, he appointed me general. And
as I had won the affections of that master of mine by my exclusive
devotion to him, when he died, having no son, he bestowed on me his
kingdom. And twenty-seven hundred years have passed over my head, since
I have been in this place, and yet, owing to eating that fruit, I do
not suffer from old age.</p>
<p>When Ek&aacute;kike&#347;arin, the king of the Bhillas, had told in
these words his own history, he went on to ask a favour of the
astonished monarch, saying, &ldquo;By the fruit given by the monkey I
gained a long life, and by that long life I have again obtained a
perfect fruit, namely, the sight of your august self. So I entreat,
king, that the condescension towards me, which you have shown by coming
to my house, may be developed into gracious approval. I have, king, a
daughter of matchless beauty, born to me by a Kshatriy&aacute; wife,
and her name is Madanasundar&iacute;. That pearl of maidens ought not
to fall to the lot of any one but your Highness. Therefore I bestow her
on you; marry her with due ceremonies. And I, my sovereign, will follow
you as your slave with twenty thousand archers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Bhilla chief addressed this petition to the king, he
granted it. And in an auspicious hour he married the daughter of that
chief, who gave him a hundred camels laden with pearls and musk. And
after the king had remained there seven days, he set out thence with
Madanasundar&iacute; and the army of the Bhillas.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, after the king had been carried away by his horse,
our army remained despondent in the forest, where the hunting took
place; but the warder Bhadr&aacute;yudha said to them, &ldquo;Away with
despondency! Even though our king has been away for a long time, he is
of divine power, and no serious misfortune will happen to him. Do you
not remember how he went to P&aacute;t&aacute;la and married there the
daughter of a N&aacute;ga, whose name was Sur&uacute;p&aacute;, and
came back here alone, and how the hero went to the world of the
Gandharvas, and returned here with T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; the
daughter of the king of the Gandharvas?&rdquo; With these words
Bhadr&aacute;yudha consoled them all, and they remained at the entrance
of the forest waiting for the king.</p>
<p>And while that Madanasundar&iacute; was advancing leisurely by an
open path, accompanied by the &#346;avara hosts, the king entered that
forest on horseback, with myself and the Vet&aacute;la, in order to get
a sight of the boar he had before seen: and when he entered it, the
boar rushed out in front of him, and the moment the king saw it, he
killed it with five arrows. When it was slain, the Vet&aacute;la rushed
to it, and tore its belly open, and suddenly there issued from it a man
of pleasing appearance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb598" href=
"#pb598" name="pb598">598</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king, astonished, asked him who he was, and then there came
there a wild elephant, resembling a moving mountain. When the king saw
that wild elephant charging down on him, he smote it in a vital place
and slew it with a single arrow. The Vet&aacute;la tore open its belly
also, and there issued from it a man of heavenly appearance, and a
woman beautiful in all her limbs. And when the king was about to
question the man, who issued from the boar, he said to him,
&ldquo;Listen, king; I am going to tell you my history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We two, king, are two sons of gods:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16865src" href="#xd27e16865" name="xd27e16865src">8</a> this
one&rsquo;s name is Bhadra, and I am &#346;ubha. As we were roaming
about we observed the hermit Kanva engaged in meditation. We assumed in
sport the forms of an elephant and a boar, and having done so, we
terrified the great sage in our reckless folly, and he pronounced on us
this curse, &lsquo;Become in this forest an elephant and boar such as
you are now; but when you shall be killed by king Vikram&aacute;ditya,
you shall be released from the curse.&rsquo; So we became an elephant
and a boar by the curse of the hermit, and we have to-day been set free
by you; as for this woman, let her tell her own story. But touch this
boar on the neck and this elephant on the back; and they will become
for you celestial sword and shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, he disappeared with his companion, and the
boar and elephant, touched by the hand of the king, became for him a
sword and a shield. Then the woman, being questioned about her history,
spoke as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the wife of a great merchant in Ujjayin&iacute; named
Dhanadatta. One night, as I was sleeping on the top of a palace, this
elephant came and swallowed me and brought me here; however this man
was not inside the elephant, but when its belly was torn open, he came
out of it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the woman said this in grief, the king said to her, &ldquo;Be
of good courage: I will take you to your husband&rsquo;s house: go and
journey along in security with my harem.&rdquo; When he had said this,
he made the Vet&aacute;la take her and hand her over to the queen
Madanasundar&iacute;, who was travelling by a different path.</p>
<p>Then, the Vet&aacute;la having returned, we suddenly saw there in
the wood two princesses, with a numerous and splendid retinue. And the
king sent me and summoned their chamberlains, and they, when asked
whence the two maidens came, told the following story;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a <i lang="sa-latn">dv&iacute;pa</i> named
Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha, the home of all felicities. In it there is a king
rightly named Gu&#7751;as&aacute;gara.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e16888src" href="#xd27e16888" name="xd27e16888src">9</a> He had
born to him by his principal queen a daughter named
Gu&#7751;avat&iacute;, who by her beauty produced <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb599" href="#pb599" name=

And holy seers announced that she should have for a husband the lord of
the seven <i lang="sa-latn">dv&iacute;pas</i>; whereupon her father the
king deliberated with his counsellors; and came to this conclusion,
&ldquo;King Vikram&aacute;ditya is a suitable husband for my daughter;
so I will send her to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, the king made his daughter embark in a ship on the sea,
with her retinue and wealth, and sent her off. But it so happened that
when the ship came near Suvar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa, it was swallowed,
with the princess and the people on board, by a large fish. But that
monstrous fish was carried by the current of the sea as if by the
course of Destiny, and thrown up on a coast near that <i lang=
"sa-latn">dv&iacute;pa</i>, and there stranded. And the people of the
neighbourhood, the moment they saw it, ran with many weapons in their
hands, and killed that marvellous fish, and cut open its
belly.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16903src" href="#xd27e16903" name=

full of people; and when the king of that <i lang=

wondering. And that king, whose name was Chandra&#347;ekhara, and who
was the brother-in-law of king Gu&#7751;as&aacute;gara, heard the whole
story from the people in the ship. Then the king, finding that
Gu&#7751;avat&iacute; was the daughter of his sister, took her into his
palace, and out of joy celebrated a feast. And the next day that king
put on board a ship in a lucky moment his daughter Chandravat&iacute;,
whom he had long intended to give to king Vikram&aacute;ditya, with
that Gu&#7751;avat&iacute;, and sent her off with much magnificence as
a gift to that sovereign.</p>
<p>These two princesses, having crossed the sea, by advancing
gradually, have at length arrived here; and we are their attendants.
And when we reached this place, a very large boar and a very large
elephant rushed upon us<span class="corr" id="xd27e16914" title=

maidens have come to offer themselves for wives to king
Vikram&aacute;ditya: so preserve them for him, ye Guardians of the
World, as is meet.&rdquo; When the boar and the elephant heard this,
they said to us with articulate speech, &ldquo;Be of good courage! the
mere mention of that king&rsquo;s name ensures your safety. And you
shall see him arrive here in a moment.&rdquo; When the boar and the
elephant, who were, no doubt, some heavenly beings or other, had said
this, they went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our story,&rdquo; said the chamberlain, and then,
queen, I said to them, &ldquo;And this is the king you seek.&rdquo;
Then they fell at the king&rsquo;s feet rejoicing, and made over to him
those two princesses Gu&#7751;avat&iacute; and Chandravat&iacute;. And
the king gave orders to the Vet&aacute;la and had those two fair ones
also taken to his queen, saying, &ldquo;Let all three travel with
Madanasundar&iacute;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb600" href=
"#pb600" name="pb600">600</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Vet&aacute;la returned immediately, and then, queen, the king
went with him and myself by an out-of-the-way path. And as we were
going along in the forest, the sun set; and just at that time we heard
there the sound of a drum. The king asked, &ldquo;Whence comes this
sound of a drum?&rdquo; The Vet&aacute;la answered him, &ldquo;King,
there is a temple here. It is a marvel of heavenly skill, having been
built by Vi&#347;vakarman; and this beating of the drum is to announce
the commencement of the evening spectacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Vet&aacute;la had said this, he and the king and I went
there out of curiosity, and after we had tied up the horse, we entered.
And we saw worshipped there a great <i>linga</i> of
<i>t&aacute;rkshyaratna</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e16929src" href=
"#xd27e16929" name="xd27e16929src">11</a> and in front of it a
spectacle with blazing lights. And there danced there for a long time
three nymphs of celestial beauty, in four kinds of measures,
accompanied with music and singing. And at the end of the spectacle we
beheld a wonder, for the dancing nymphs disappeared in the figures
carved on the pillars of the temple: and in the same way the singers
and players went into the figures of men painted on the walls. When the
king saw this, he was astonished, but the Vet&aacute;la said to him,
&ldquo;Such is this heavenly enchantment produced by Vi&#347;vakarman,
lasting for ever, for this will always take place at both
twilights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had said this, we wandered about in the temple, and saw in
one place a female figure on a pillar, of extraordinary beauty. When
the king saw her, he was bewildered by her beauty, and remained for a
moment absent-minded and motionless, so that he himself was like a
figure cut on a pillar. And he exclaimed, &ldquo;If I do not see a
living woman like this figure, of what profit to me is my kingdom or my
life?&rdquo; When the Vet&aacute;la heard this, he said, &ldquo;Your
wish is not hard to gratify, for the king of Kalinga has a daughter
named Kalingasen&aacute;, and a sculptor of Vardham&aacute;na seeing
her, and being desirous of representing her beauty, carved this figure
in imitation of her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16934src" href=
"#xd27e16934" name="xd27e16934src">12</a> So return to Ujjayin&iacute;,
king, and ask that king of Kalinga for his daughter, or carry her off
by force.&rdquo; This speech of the Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s the king laid
up in his heart.</p>
<p>Then we spent that night there, and the next morning we set out, and
we saw two handsome men under an <i>a&#347;oka</i>-tree, and then they
rose up and bowed before the king. Then the king said to them,
&ldquo;Who are you, and why are you in the forest?&rdquo; One of them
answered, &ldquo;Listen, king, I will tell you the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Dhanadatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am the son of a merchant in Ujjayin&iacute;, and my
name is Dhanadatta. Once on a time I went to sleep with my wife on the
top of my palace. In the morning I woke up and looked about me, and lo!
my wife was not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb601" href="#pb601"
name="pb601">601</a>]</span>in the palace, nor in the garden attached
to it, nor anywhere about it. I said to myself, &ldquo;She has not lost
her heart to another man; of that I am convinced by the fact that the
garland which she gave me, telling me that as long as she remained
chaste, it would certainly not fade, is still as fresh as
ever.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16959src" href="#xd27e16959" name=
"xd27e16959src">13</a> So I cannot think where she has gone, whether
she has been carried off by a demon or some other evil being, or what
has happened to her.&rdquo; With these thoughts in my mind, I remained
looking for her, crying out, lamenting, and weeping; consumed by the
fire of separation from her; taking no food. Then my relations
succeeded at last in consoling me to a certain extent, and I took food,
and I made my abode in a temple, and remained there plunged in grief,
feasting Br&aacute;hmans.</p>
<p>Once when I was quite broken down, this Br&aacute;hman came to me
there, and I refreshed him with a bath and food, and after he had
eaten, I asked him whence he came, and he said, &ldquo;I am from a
village near V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;.&rdquo; My servants
told him my cause of woe, and he said, &ldquo;Why have you, like an
unenterprising man, allowed your spirits to sink? The energetic man
obtains even that which it is hard to attain; so rise up my friend, and
let us look for your wife; I will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;How are we to look for her, when we do not even know
in what direction she has gone?&rdquo; When I said this, he answered me
kindly, &ldquo;Do not say this; did not Ke&#347;a&#7789;a long ago
recover his wife, when it seemed hopeless that he should ever be
reunited with her? Hear his story in proof of it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Ke&#347;a&#7789;a and Kandarpa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in the city of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a
wealthy young Br&aacute;hman, the son of a Br&aacute;hman; his name was
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, and he was in beauty like a second god of love. He
wished to obtain a wife like himself, and so he went forth
secretly<a class="noteref" id="xd27e16971src" href="#xd27e16971" name=
"xd27e16971src">14</a> from his parents&rsquo; house, and wandered
through various lands on the pretext of visiting holy bathing-places.
And in the course of his wanderings he came once on a time to the bank
of the Narmad&aacute;, and he saw a numerous procession of
bridegroom&rsquo;s friends coming that way. And a distinguished old
Br&aacute;hman, belonging to that company, when he saw
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a in the distance, left his companions, and coming up
to him accosted him, and respectfully said to him in private, &ldquo;I
have a certain favour to ask of you, and it is one which you can easily
do for me, but the benefit conferred on me will be a very great one;
so, if you will do it, I will proceed to say what it is.&rdquo; When
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a heard this, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb602"
href="#pb602" name="pb602">602</a>]</span>he said, &ldquo;Noble sir, if
what you say is possible, I must certainly do it: let the benefit be
conferred on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he said, &ldquo;Listen, my good
young man; I have a son, who is the prince of ugly, as you are of
good-looking, men. He has projecting teeth, a flat nose, a black
colour, squinting eyes, a big belly, crooked feet, and ears like
winnowing baskets. Though he is such, I, out of my love for him,
described him as handsome, and asked a Br&aacute;hman, named
Ratnadatta, to give him his daughter, named R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, and
he has agreed to do it. The girl is as beautiful as her name expresses,
and to-day they are to be married. For this reason we have come, but I
know that, when that purposed connexion of mine sees my son, he will
refuse to give him his daughter, and this attempt will be fruitless.
And while thinking how I could find some way out of the difficulty, I
have met you here, courteous sir; so quickly perform for me my desire,
as you have pledged your word to do. Come with us, and marry that
maiden, and hand her over to my son to-day, for you are as good-looking
as the bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ke&#347;a&#7789;a heard this, he said, &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo;
and so the old Br&aacute;hman took Ke&#347;a&#7789;a with him, and they
crossed the Narmad&aacute; in boats and landed on the opposite bank.
And so he reached the city, and rested outside it with his followers,
and at that time the sun also, the traveller of the sky, went to his
rest on the mountain of setting. Then the darkness began to diffuse
itself abroad, and Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, having gone to rinse his mouth,
saw a terrible R&aacute;kshasa rise up near the water; and the
R&aacute;kshasa said, &ldquo;Where will you go from me,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e16986src" href="#xd27e16986" name=
"xd27e16986src">15</a> Ke&#347;a&#7789;a? I am about to devour
you.&rdquo; Thereupon Ke&#347;a&#7789;a said to the <span class="corr"
id="xd27e16995" title="Source: R&aacute;hshasa">R&aacute;kshasa</span>,
&ldquo;Do not devour me now; I will certainly come back to you
presently, when I have done the Br&aacute;hman the service I
promised.&rdquo; When the R&aacute;kshasa heard this, he made
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a take an oath to this effect, and then let him go; and
he returned to the company of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>Then the old Br&aacute;hman brought Ke&#347;a&#7789;a adorned with
the ornaments of a bridegroom, and entered that city with all the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party. And then he made him enter the house of
Ratnadatta, in which an altar-platform was ready prepared, and which
was made to resound with the music of various instruments. And
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a married there with all due ceremonies that fair-faced
maiden R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, to whom her father gave great wealth.
And the women there rejoiced, seeing that the bride and bridegroom were
well-matched; and not only R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, when she saw that
such a bridegroom had arrived, but her friends also, fell in love with
him. But Ke&#347;a&#7789;a at that time was overpowered with
despondency and astonishment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb603"
href="#pb603" name="pb603">603</a>]</span></p>
<p>And at night R&uacute;pavat&iacute; seeing that her husband, as he
lay on the bed, was plunged in thought, and kept his head turned away,
pretended to be asleep. And in the dead of night Ke&#347;a&#7789;a,
thinking that she was asleep, went out to that R&aacute;kshasa to keep
his promise. And that faithful wife R&uacute;pavat&iacute; also gently
rose up unobserved, and followed her husband, full of curiosity. And
when Ke&#347;a&#7789;a arrived where the R&aacute;kshasa was, the
latter said to him, &ldquo;Bravo! you have kept your promise
faithfully, Ke&#347;a&#7789;a; you are a man of noble character. You
sanctify your city of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra and your father
De&#347;a&#7789;a by your virtue, so approach, that I may devour
you.&rdquo; When R&uacute;pavat&iacute; heard that, she came up quickly
and said, &ldquo;Eat me, for, if my husband is eaten, what will become
of me?&rdquo; The R&aacute;kshasa said, &ldquo;You can live on
alms.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Who, noble sir, will give alms to me
who am a woman?&rdquo; The R&aacute;kshasa said, &ldquo;If any one
refuses to give you alms, when asked to do so, his head shall split in
a hundred pieces.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17003src" href=
"#xd27e17003" name="xd27e17003src">16</a> Then she said, &ldquo;This
being so, give me my husband by way of alms.&rdquo; And, as the
R&aacute;kshasa would not give him, his head at once split asunder, and
he died. Then R&uacute;pavat&iacute; returned to her bridal-chamber,
with her husband, who was exceedingly astonished at her virtue, and at
that moment the night came to an end.</p>
<p>And the next morning the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends took food and
set out from that city, and reached the bank of the Narmad&aacute; with
the newly married pair. Then the old Br&aacute;hman, who was their
leader, put the wife R&uacute;pavat&iacute; with her attendants on
board one boat, and went on board a second himself, and cunningly made
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a embark on a third, having previously made an
agreement with the boatmen; and before he went on board took from him
all the ornaments he had lent him. Then the Br&aacute;hman was ferried
across with the wife and the bridegroom&rsquo;s party, but
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a was kept out in the middle of the stream by the
boatmen, and carried to a great distance. Then those boatmen pushed the
boat and Ke&#347;a&#7789;a into a place where the current ran full and
strong, and swam ashore themselves, having been bribed by the old
Br&aacute;hman.</p>
<p>But Ke&#347;a&#7789;a was carried with the boat, by the river which
was lashed into waves by the wind, into the sea, and at last a wave
flung him up on the coast. There he recovered strength and spirits, as
he was not doomed to die just yet, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Well,
that Br&aacute;hman has made me a fine recompense. But was not the fact
that he married his son by means of a substitute, in itself sufficient
proof that he was a fool and a scoundrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he remained there, buried in such thoughts, the night came on
him, when the companies of air-flying witches begin to roam about. He
remained sleepless through it, and in the fourth watch he heard a noise
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb604" href="#pb604" name=
"pb604">604</a>]</span>sky, and saw a handsome<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e17014src" href="#xd27e17014" name="xd27e17014src">17</a> man fall
from heaven in front of him. Ke&#347;a&#7789;a was terrified at first,
but after some time he saw that he had nothing uncanny about him, so he
said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, Sir?&rdquo; Then the man said,
&ldquo;First tell me who you are; and then I will tell you who I
am.&rdquo; Hearing that, Ke&#347;a&#7789;a told him his history. Then
the man said, &ldquo;My friend, you are exactly in the same predicament
as myself, so I will now tell you my history, listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is on the bank of the river Ve&#7751;&aacute; a city
named Ratnapura; I am a Br&aacute;hman householder in that city, the
son of a rich man, and my name is Kandarpa. One evening I went down to
the river Ve&#7751;&aacute; to draw water, and I slipped and fell into
it, and was carried away by the current. The current carried me a long
way during that night, and when the morning came, as I was not doomed
to die yet, it brought me to the foot of a tree that grew on the bank.
I climbed up the bank by the help of the tree, and when I had recovered
breath, I saw in front of me a great empty temple dedicated to the
Mothers. I entered it, and when I saw before me the Mothers flashing,
as it were, with brightness and power, my fear was allayed, and I bowed
before them, and praised them and addressed this prayer to them,
&lsquo;Venerable ones, deliver me a miserable man; for I have to-day
come here as a suppliant for your protection.&rsquo; When I had uttered
this prayer, being exhausted with my struggles in the current of the
river, I rested, my friend, till my fatigue gradually disappeared, and
the day disappeared also. And then there appeared the horrible female
ascetic called night, furnished with many stars by way of a
bone-necklace, white with moonlight instead of ashes, and carrying the
moon for a gleaming seull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, I remember, a band of witches came out from the
company of the Mothers, and they said to one another, &lsquo;To night
we must go to the general assembly of the witches in
Chakrapura,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17027src" href="#xd27e17027"
name="xd27e17027src">18</a> and how can this Br&aacute;hman be kept
safe in this place which is full of wild beasts? So let us take him to
some place where he will be happy: and afterwards we will bring him
back again; he has fled to us for protection.&rsquo; When they had said
this, they adorned me, and carrying me through the air, placed me in
the house of a rich Br&aacute;hman in a certain city, and went
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I looked about me there, lo! the altar was prepared
for a marriage, and the auspicious hour had arrived, but the procession
of bridegroom&rsquo;s friends was nowhere to be seen. And all the
people, seeing me in front of the door arrayed in bridegroom&rsquo;s
garments of heavenly splendour, said, &lsquo;Here is the bridegroom at
any rate arrived.&rsquo; Then the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb605"
href="#pb605" name="pb605">605</a>]</span>Br&aacute;hman of the house
took me to the altar, and led his daughter there adorned, and gave her
to me with the usual ceremonies. And the women said to one another,
&lsquo;Fortunate is it that the beauty of Sumanas has borne fruit by
winning her a bridegroom like herself!&rsquo; Then, having married
Sumanas, I slept with her in a palace, gratified by having every want
supplied in the most magnificent style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then those witches came back from their assembly in this last
watch of the night, and by their supernatural power carried me off, and
flew up into the air with me. And while they were flying through the
air, they had a fight with another set of witches, who came, wishing to
carry me off, and they let me go and I fell down here. And I do not
know the city where I married that Sumanas; and I cannot tell what will
become of her now. This succession of misfortunes, which Destiny has
brought upon me, has now ended in happiness by my meeting with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kandarpa had given this account of his adventure,
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, my friend; the
witches will have no power over you henceforth; since I possess a
certain irresistible charm, which will keep them at a distance: now let
us roam about together: Destiny will bestow on us good fortune.&rdquo;
And while they were engaged in this conversation, the night came to an
end.</p>
<p>In the morning Ke&#347;a&#7789;a and Kandarpa set out from that
place together, and crossing the sea, reached in due course a city
named Bh&iacute;mapura near the river called Ratnanad&iacute;. There
they heard a great noise on the bank of that river, and when they went
to the place whence it came, they saw a fish that filled the channel of
the stream from bank to bank. It had been thrown up by the tide of the
sea, and got fast in the river owing to the vastness of its bulk, and
men with various weapons in their hands were cutting it up to procure
flesh. And while they were cutting it open, there came out of its belly
a woman, and being beheld by the people with astonishment, she came
terrified to the bank.</p>
<p>Then Kandarpa looked at her, and said exultingly to
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, &ldquo;My friend, here is that very Sumanas, whom I
married. But I do not know how she came to be living in the belly of a
fish. So let us remain here in silence, until the whole matter is
cleared up.&rdquo; Ke&#347;a&#7789;a consented, and they remained
there. And the people said to Sumanas, &ldquo;Who are you, and what is
the meaning of this?&rdquo; Then she said very reluctantly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the daughter of a crest-jewel of Br&aacute;hmans, named
Jayadatta, who lived in the city of Ratn&aacute;kara. My name is
Sumanas, and one night I was married to a certain handsome young
Br&aacute;hman, who was a suitable match for me. That very night, my
husband went away somewhere, while I was asleep; and though my father
made diligent search for him, he could not find him anywhere. Then I
threw myself into the river to cool <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb606" href="#pb606" name="pb606">606</a>]</span>the fire of grief at
separation from him, and I was swallowed by this fish; and now Destiny
has brought me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was saying this, a Br&aacute;hman named Yajnasv&aacute;min
rushed out of the crowd, and embraced her and said this to her,
&ldquo;Come, come with me, niece; you are the daughter of my sister;
for I am Yajnasv&aacute;min, your mother&rsquo;s own
brother<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; When
Sumanas heard that, she uncovered her face and looked at him, and
recognising her uncle, she embraced his feet weeping. But after a
moment she ceased weeping, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you give me fuel,
for, as I am separated from my husband, I have no other refuge but the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her uncle did all he could to dissuade her, but she would not
abandon her intention; and then Kandarpa, having thus seen her real
feelings tested, came up to her. When the wise Sumanas saw him near
her, she recognised him, and fell weeping at his feet. And when the
discreet woman was questioned by the people, and by that uncle of hers,
she answered, &ldquo;He is my husband.&rdquo; Then all were delighted,
and Yajnasv&aacute;min took her husband Kandarpa to his house, together
with Ke&#347;a&#7789;a. There they told their adventures, and
<span class="corr" id="xd27e17057" title=
"Source: Yajna&#347;v&aacute;min">Yajnasv&aacute;min</span> and his
family lovingly waited on them with many hospitable attentions.</p>
<p>After some days had passed, Ke&#347;a&#7789;a said to Kandarpa,
&ldquo;You have gained all you want by recovering your longed-for wife;
so now go with her to Ratnapura your own city; but, as I have not
attained the object of my desire, I will not return to my own country:
I, my friend, will make a pilgrimage to all the holy bathing-places and
so destroy my body.&rdquo; When <span class="corr" id="xd27e17062"
title="Source: Yajna&#347;v&aacute;min">Yajnasv&aacute;min</span>, in
Bh&iacute;mapura, heard this, he said to Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, &ldquo;Why
do you utter this despondent speech? As long as people are alive, there
is nothing they cannot get: in proof of this hear the story of
Kusum&aacute;yudha, which I am about to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Kusum&aacute;yudha and
Kamalalochan&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in a town named Chandrapura a Br&aacute;hman
named Devasv&aacute;min: he had a very beautiful daughter named
Kamalalochan&aacute;. And he had a young Br&aacute;hman pupil named
Kusum&aacute;yudha; and that pupil and his daughter loved one another
well.</p>
<p>One day her father made up his mind to give her to another suitor,
and at once that maiden sent by her confidante the following message to
Kusum&aacute;yudha, &ldquo;Though I have long ago fixed my heart on you
for a husband, my father has promised to give me to another, so devise
a scheme for carrying me off hence.&rdquo; So Kusum&aacute;yudha made
an arrangement to carry her off, and he placed outside her house at
night a servant with a mule for that purpose. So she quietly went out
and mounted the mule, but that servant did not take her to his master;
he took her somewhere else, to make her his own. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb607" href="#pb607" name="pb607">607</a>]</span></p>
<p>And during the night he took Kamalalochan&aacute; a long distance,
and they reached a certain city by the morning, when that chaste woman
said to the servant, &ldquo;Where is my husband your master? Why do you
not take me to him?&rdquo; When the cunning rogue heard this, he said
to her who was alone in a foreign country, &ldquo;I am going to marry
you myself: never mind about him; how can you get to him now?&rdquo;
When the discreet woman heard this, she said, &ldquo;Indeed I love you
very much.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17075src" href=
"#xd27e17075" name="xd27e17075src">19</a> Then the rascal left her in
the garden of the city, and went to the market to buy the things
required for a wedding. In the meanwhile that maiden fled, with the
mule, and entered the house of a certain old man who made garlands. She
told him her history, and he made her welcome, so she remained there.
And the wicked servant, not finding her in the garden, went away from
it disappointed, and returned to his master Kusum&aacute;yudha. And
when his master questioned him, he said, &ldquo;The fact is, you are an
upright man yourself, and you do not understand the ways of deceitful
women. No sooner did she come out and was seen, than I was seized there
by those other men, and the mule was taken away from me. By good luck I
managed to escape and have come here.&rdquo; When Kusum&aacute;yudha
heard this, he remained silent, and plunged in thought.</p>
<p>One day his father sent him to be married, and as he was going
along, he reached the city, where Kamalalochan&aacute; was. There he
made the bridegroom&rsquo;s followers encamp in a neighbouring garden,
and while he was roaming about alone, Kamalalochan&aacute; saw him, and
told the garland-maker in whose house she was living. He went and told
her intended husband what had taken place, and brought him to her. Then
the garland-maker collected the necessary things, and the long-desired
marriage between the youth and the maiden was immediately celebrated.
Then Kusum&aacute;yudha punished that wicked servant, and married in
addition that second maiden, who was the cause of his finding
Kamalalochan&aacute;, and in order to marry whom he had started from
home, and he returned rejoicing to his own country with those two
wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the fortunate are reunited in the most unexpected
manner, and so you may be certain, Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, of regaining your
beloved soon in the same way.&rdquo; When Yajnasv&aacute;min had said
this, Kandarpa, Sumanas and Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, remained for some days
in his house, and then they set out for their own country. But on the
way they reached a great forest, and they were separated from one
another in the confusion produced by a charge of wild elephants. Of the
party Ke&#347;a&#7789;a went on alone and grieved, and in course of
time reached the city of K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; and found his friend
Kandarpa there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb608" href="#pb608"
name="pb608">608</a>]</span>And he went with him to his own city
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and he remained there some time welcomed by
his father. And there he told his parents all his adventures, beginning
with his marrying R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, and ending with the story of
Kandarpa.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Sumanas fled, terrified at the elephants, and
entered a thicket, and while she was there, the sun set for her. And
when night came on, she cried out in her woe, &ldquo;Alas, my husband!
Alas, my father! Alas, my mother!&rdquo; and resolved to fling herself
into a forest fire. And in the meanwhile that company of witches, that
were so full of pity for Kandarpa, having conquered the other witches,
reached their own temple. There they remembered Kandarpa, and finding
out by their supernatural knowledge that his wife had lost her way in a
wood, they deliberated as follows, &ldquo;Kandarpa, being a resolute
man, will unaided obtain his desire; but his wife, being a young girl,
and having lost her way in the forest, will assuredly die. So let us
take her and put her down in Ratnapura, in order that she may live
there in the house of Kandarpa&rsquo;s father with his other
wife.&rdquo; When the witches had come to this conclusion, they went to
that forest and comforted Sumanas there, and took her and left her in
Ratnapura.</p>
<p>When the night had passed, Sumanas, wandering about in that city,
heard the following cry in the mouths of the people who were running
hither and thither, &ldquo;Lo! the virtuous Anangavat&iacute;, the wife
of the Br&aacute;hman Kandarpa, who, after her husband had gone
somewhere or other, lived a long time in hope of reunion with him, not
having recovered him, has now gone out in despair to enter the fire,
followed by her weeping father-in-law and mother-in-law.&rdquo; When
Sumanas heard that, she went quickly to the place where the pyre had
been made, and going up to Anangavat&iacute;, said to her, in order to
dissuade her, &ldquo;Noble lady, do not act rashly, for that husband of
yours is alive.&rdquo; Having said this, she told the whole story from
the beginning. And she shewed the jewelled ring that Kandarpa gave her.
Then all welcomed her, perceiving that her account was true. Then
Kandarpa&rsquo;s father honoured that bride Sumanas and gladly lodged
her in his house with the delighted Anangavat&iacute;.</p>
<p>Then Kandarpa left P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e17102src" href="#xd27e17102" name="xd27e17102src">20</a> without
telling Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, as he knew he would not like it, in order to
roam about in search of Sumanas. And after he had gone,
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, feeling unhappy without R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, left
his house without his parents&rsquo; knowledge, and went to roam about
hither and thither. And Kandarpa, in the course of his wanderings,
happened to visit that very city, where Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, married
R&uacute;pavat&iacute;. And hearing a great noise of people, he asked
what it meant, and a certain man said to him, &ldquo;Here is
R&uacute;pavat&iacute; preparing to die, as she cannot find her husband
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb609" href=
"#pb609" name="pb609">609</a>]</span>tumult is on that account; listen
to the story connected with her.&rdquo; Then that man related the
strange story of R&uacute;pavat&iacute;&rsquo;s marriage with
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a and of her adventure with the R&aacute;kshasa, and
then continued as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that old Br&aacute;hman, having tricked
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, went on his way, taking with him
R&uacute;pavat&iacute; for his son: but nobody knew where
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a had gone after marrying her. And
R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, not seeing Ke&#347;a&#7789;a on the journey,
said, &lsquo;Why do I not see my husband here, though all the rest of
the party are travelling along with me?<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e17112" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> When the old
Br&aacute;hman heard that, he shewed her that son of his, and said to
her, &lsquo;My daughter, this son of mine is your husband; behold
him.&rsquo; Then R&uacute;pavat&iacute; said in a rage to the old man
there, &lsquo;I will not have this ugly fellow for a husband; I will
certainly die, if I cannot get that husband, who married me
yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying this, she at once stopped eating and drinking; and the
old Br&aacute;hman, through fear of the king, had her taken back to her
father&rsquo;s house. There she told the trick that the old
Br&aacute;hman had played her, and her father, in great grief, said to
her, &lsquo;How are we to discover, my daughter, who the man that
married you, is?&rsquo; Then R&uacute;pavat&iacute; said, &lsquo;My
husband&rsquo;s name is Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, and he is the son of a
Br&aacute;hman named De&#347;a&#7789;a in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra; for
so much I heard from the mouth of a R&aacute;kshasa.&rsquo; When she
had said this, she told her father the whole story of her husband and
the R&aacute;kshasa. Then her father went and saw the R&aacute;kshasa
lying dead, and so he believed his daughter&rsquo;s story, and was
pleased with the virtue of that couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He consoled his daughter with hopes of reunion with her
husband, and sent his son to Ke&#347;a&#7789;a&rsquo;s father in
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, to search for him. And after some time they
came back and said, &lsquo;We saw the householder De&#347;a&#7789;a in
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. But when we asked him where his son
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a was, he answered us with tears, &ldquo;My son
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a is not here; he did return here, and a friend of his
named Kandarpa came with him; but he went away from here without
telling me, pining for R&uacute;pavat&iacute;&rdquo;&mdash;When we
heard this speech of his, we came back here in due course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When those sent to search had brought back this report,
R&uacute;pavat&iacute; said to her father, &lsquo;I shall never recover
my husband, so I will enter the fire; how long, father, can I live here
without my husband?&rsquo; She went on saying this, and as her father
has not been able to dissuade her, she has come out to-day to perish in
the fire. And two maidens, friends of hers, have come out to die in the
same way; one is called &#346;&#7771;ing&aacute;ravat&iacute; and the
other Anur&aacute;gavat&iacute;. For long ago, at the marriage of
R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, they saw Ke&#347;a&#7789;a and made up their
minds that they would have him for a husband, as their hearts were
captivated by his beauty. This is the meaning of the noise which the
people here are making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kandarpa heard this from that man, he went to the pyre which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb610" href="#pb610" name=
"pb610">610</a>]</span>had been heaped up for those ladies. He made a
sign to the people from a distance to cease their tumult, and going up
quickly, he said to R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, who was worshipping the
fire; &ldquo;Noble lady; desist from this rashness; that husband of
yours Ke&#347;a&#7789;a is alive; he is my friend; know that I am
Kandarpa.&rdquo; When he had said this, he told her all
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a&rsquo;s adventures, beginning with the circumstance
of the old Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s treacherously making him embark on
the boat. Then R&uacute;pavat&iacute; believed him, as his story
tallied so completely with what she knew, and she joyfully entered her
father&rsquo;s house with those two friends. And her father kindly
welcomed Kandarpa and took good care of him; and so he remained there,
to please him.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile it happened that, as Ke&#347;a&#7789;a was roaming
about, he reached Ratnapura and found there the house of Kandarpa, in
which his two wives were. And as he was wandering about near the house,
Sumanas, the wife of Kandarpa, saw him from the top of the house and
said delighted to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, and the other
people in the house, &ldquo;Here now is Ke&#347;a&#7789;a my
husband&rsquo;s friend arrived; we may hear news of my husband from
him; quickly invite him in.&rdquo; Then they went and on some pretext
or other brought in Ke&#347;a&#7789;a as she advised, and when he saw
Sumanas come towards him, he was delighted. And after he had rested she
questioned him, and he immediately told her his own and
Kandarpa&rsquo;s adventures, after the scare produced by the wild
elephants.</p>
<p>He remained there some days, hospitably entertained, and then a
messenger came from Kandarpa with a letter. The messenger said,
&ldquo;Kandarpa and R&uacute;pavat&iacute; are in the town where
Kandarpa&rsquo;s friend Ke&#347;a&#7789;a married
R&uacute;pavat&iacute;;&rdquo; and the contents of the letter were to
the same effect; and Ke&#347;a&#7789;a communicated the tidings with
tears to the father of Kandarpa.</p>
<p>And the next day Kandarpa&rsquo;s father sent in high glee a
messenger to bring his son, and dismissed Ke&#347;a&#7789;a, that he
might join his beloved. And Ke&#347;a&#7789;a went with that messenger,
who brought the letter, to that country where R&uacute;pavat&iacute;
was living in her father&rsquo;s house. There, after a long absence, he
greeted and refreshed the delighted R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, as the
cloud does the <i>ch&aacute;tak&iacute;</i>. He met Kandarpa once more,
and he married at the instance of R&uacute;pavat&iacute; her two
before-mentioned friends, Anur&aacute;gavat&iacute; and
&#346;&#7771;ing&aacute;ravat&iacute;. And then Ke&#347;a&#7789;a went
with R&uacute;pavat&iacute; and them to his own land, after taking
leave of Kandarpa. And Kandarpa returned to Ratnapura with the
messenger, and was once more united to Sumanas and Anangavat&iacute;
and his relations. So Kandarpa regained his beloved Sumanas, and
Ke&#347;a&#7789;a his beloved R&uacute;pavat&iacute;, and they lived
enjoying the good things of this life, each in his own country.</p>
<p>Thus men of firm resolution, though separated by adverse destiny,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb611" href="#pb611" name=
"pb611">611</a>]</span>are reunited with their dear ones, despising
even terrible sufferings, and taking no account of their interminable
duration. So rise up quickly my friend, let us go; you also will find
your wife, if you search for her; who knows the way of Destiny? I
myself regained my wife alive after she had died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telling me this tale my friend encouraged me; and himself
accompanied me; and so roaming about with him, I reached this land, and
here I saw a mighty elephant and a wild boar. And, (wonderful to say!)
I saw that elephant bring my helpless wife out of his mouth, and
swallow her again; and I followed that elephant, which appeared for a
moment and then disappeared for a long time, and in my search for it I
have now, thanks to my merits, beheld your Majesty here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young merchant had said this, Vikram&aacute;ditya sent for
his wife, whom he had rescued by killing the elephant, and handed her
over to him. And then the couple, delighted at their marvellous
reunion, recounted their adventures to one another, and their mouths
were loud in praise of the glorious king Vishama&#347;&iacute;la.</p>

Oesterley&rsquo;s Bait&aacute;l Pach&iacute;s&iacute;, p. 14; and the
note on p. 176. In Aelian&rsquo;s Varia Historia, III, 19, there is a
tree, the fruit of which makes an old man become gradually younger and
younger until he reaches the antenatal state of non-existence. The
passage is referred to by Rohde, Der Griechische Roman, p. 207. Baring
Gould, in Appendix A to his Curious Myths of the Middle Ages, gives a
very curious passage from the Bragda M&aacute;gus Saga, an Icelandic
version of the romance of Maugis. Here we have a man named
Vidf&ouml;rull who was in the habit of changing his skin and becoming
young again. He changed his skin once when he was 330 years old, a
second time at the age of 215, and a third time in the presence of
Charlemagne. It is quite possible that the story in the text is a form
of the fable of the Wandering Jew.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h3 class="main">Story of Chandrasv&aacute;min who recovered his wife
alive after her death.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am a young Br&aacute;hman of the name of
Chandrasv&aacute;min, living on that magnificent grant to
Br&aacute;hmans, called Brahmasthala, and I have a beautiful wife in my
house. One day I had gone to the village for some object, by my
father&rsquo;s orders, and a <i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>, who had
come to beg, cast eyes on that wife of mine. She caught a fever from
the moment he looked at her, and in the evening she died. Then my
relations took her, and put her on the pyre during the night. And when
the pyre was in full blaze, I returned there from the village; and I
heard what had happened from my family who wept before me.</p>
<p>Then I went near the pyre, and the <i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>
came there with the magic staff dancing<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e17161src" href="#xd27e17161" name="xd27e17161src">1</a> on his
shoulder, and the booming drum in his hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb612" href="#pb612" name="pb612">612</a>]</span>He
quenched the flume of the pyre, king, by throwing ashes on it,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e17187src" href="#xd27e17187" name=
"xd27e17187src">2</a> and then my wife rose up from the midst of it
uninjured. The <i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i> took with him my wife who
followed him, drawn by his magic power, and ran off quickly, and I
followed him with my bow and arrows.</p>
<p>And when he reached a cave on the bank of the Ganges, he put the
magic staff down on the ground, and said exultingly to two maidens who
were in it, &ldquo;She, without whom I could not marry you, though I
had obtained you, has come into my possession; and so my vow has been
successfully accomplished,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17195src"
href="#xd27e17195" name="xd27e17195src">3</a> Saying this he shewed
them my wife, and at that moment I flung his magic staff into the
Ganges; and when he had lost his magic power by the loss of the staff,
I reproached him, exclaiming, &ldquo;<i><span class="corr" id=
"xd27e17205" title=
"Source: K&aacute;palika">K&aacute;p&aacute;lika</span></i>, as you
wish to rob me of my wife, you shall live no longer.&rdquo; Then the
scoundrel, not seeing his magic staff, tried to run away; but I drew my
bow and killed him with a poisoned arrow. Thus do heretics, who feign
the vows of &#346;iva only for the pleasure of accomplishing nefarious
ends, fall, though their sin has already sunk them deep enough.</p>
<p>Then I took my wife, and those other two maidens, and I returned
home, exciting the astonishment of my relations. Then I asked those two
maidens to tell me their history, and they gave me this answer,
&ldquo;We are the daughters respectively of a king and a chief merchant
in Benares, and the <i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i> carried us off by the
same magic process by which he carried off your wife, and thanks to you
we have been delivered from the villain without suffering
insult.&rdquo; This was their tale; and the next day I took them to
Benares, and handed them over to their relations, after telling what
had befallen them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17213src" href=
"#xd27e17213" name="xd27e17213src">4</a></p>
<p>And as I was returning thence, I saw this young merchant, who had
lost his wife, and I came here with him. Moreover, I anointed my body
with an ointment that I found in the cave of the
<i>k&aacute;p&aacute;lika</i>; and, observe, perfume still exhales from
it, even though it has been washed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this sense did I recover my wife arisen from the
dead.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman had told this story, the king
honoured him and the young merchant, and sent them on their way. And
then that king Vikram&aacute;ditya, taking with him
Gu&#7751;avat&iacute;, Chandravat&iacute;, and Madanasundar&iacute;,
and having met his own forces, returned to the city of Ujjayin&iacute;,
and there he married Gu&#7751;avat&iacute; and Chandravat&iacute;.</p>
<p>Then the king called to mind the figure carved on a pillar that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb613" href="#pb613" name=
"pb613">613</a>]</span>had seen in the temple built by
Vi&#347;vakarman, and he gave this order to the warder, &ldquo;Let an
ambassador be sent to Kalingasena to demand from him that maiden whose
likeness I saw carved on the pillar.&rdquo; When the warder received
this command from the king, he brought before him an ambassador named
Suvigraha, and sent him off with a message.</p>
<p>So the ambassador went to the country of Kalinga, and when he had
seen the king Kalingasena, he delivered to him the message with which
he had been entrusted, which was as follows, &ldquo;King, the glorious
sovereign Vikram&aacute;ditya sends you this command, &lsquo;You know
that every jewel on the earth comes to me as my due; and you have a
pearl of a daughter, so hand her over to me, and then by my favour you
shall enjoy in your own realm an unopposed sway.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
When the king of Kalinga heard this, he was very angry, and he said,
&ldquo;Who is this king Vikram&aacute;ditya? Does he presume to give me
orders and ask for my daughter as a tribute? Blinded with pride he
shall be cast down.&rdquo; When the ambassador heard this from
Kalingasena, he said to him, &ldquo;How can you, being a servant, dare
to set yourself up against your master? You do not know your place.
What, madman, do you wish to be shrivelled like a moth in the fire of
his wrath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the ambassador had said this, he returned and communicated to
king Vikram&aacute;ditya that speech of Kalingasena&rsquo;s. Then king
<span class="corr" id="xd27e17231" title=
"Source: Vishama&#347;&iacute;la">Vikram&aacute;ditya</span>, being
angry, marched out with his forces to attack the king of Kalinga, and
the Vet&aacute;la Bh&uacute;taketu went with him. As he marched along,
the quarters, re-echoing the roar of his army, seemed to say to the
king of Kalinga, &ldquo;Surrender the maiden quickly,&rdquo; and so he
reached that country. When king Vikram&aacute;ditya saw the king of
Kalinga ready for battle, he surrounded him with his forces; but then
he thought in his mind, &ldquo;I shall never be happy without this
king&rsquo;s daughter; and yet how can I kill my own father-in-law?
Suppose I have recourse to some stratagem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had gone through these reflections, he went with the
Vet&aacute;la, and by his supernatural power entered the bedchamber of
the king of Kalinga at night, when he was asleep, without being seen.
Then the Vet&aacute;la woke up the king, and when he was terrified,
said to him laughing, &ldquo;What! do you dare to sleep, when you are
at war with king Vikram&aacute;ditya?&rdquo; Then the king of Kalinga
rose up, and seeing the monarch, who had thus shown his daring,
standing with a terrible Vet&aacute;la at his side, and recognising
him, bowed trembling at his feet, and said, &ldquo;King, I now
acknowledge your supremacy; tell me what I am to do.&rdquo; And the
king answered him, &ldquo;If you wish to have me as your overlord, give
me your daughter Kalingasen&aacute;.&rdquo; Then the king of Kalinga
agreed, and promised to give him his daughter, and so the monarch
returned successful to his camp. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb614"
href="#pb614" name="pb614">614</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the next day, queen, your father the king of Kalinga bestowed
you on king Vishama&#347;&iacute;la with appropriate ceremonies, and a
splendid marriage-gift. Thus, queen, you were lawfully married by the
king out of his deep love for you, and at the risk of his own life, and
not out of any desire to triumph over an enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard this story, my friends, from the mouth of the
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> Devasena, I dismissed my anger, which was
caused by the contempt with which I supposed myself to have been
treated. So, you see, this king was induced to marry me by seeing a
likeness of me carved on a pillar, and to marry Malayavat&iacute; by
seeing a painted portrait of her.&rdquo; In these words
Kalingasen&aacute;, the beloved wife of king Vikram&aacute;ditya,
described her husband&rsquo;s might, and delighted his other wives.
Then Vikram&aacute;ditya, accompanied by all of them, and by
Malayavat&iacute;, remained delighting in his empire.</p>
<p>Then, one day, a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t named <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e17247" title=
"Source: Krish&#7751;a&#347;akti">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#347;akti</span>,
who had been oppressed by the members of his clan, came there from the
Dakkan. He went to the palace-gate surrounded by five hundred
R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts, and took on himself the vow of
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> to the king. And though the king tried to
dissuade him, he made this declaration, &ldquo;I will serve king
Vikram&aacute;ditya for twelve years.&rdquo; And he remained at the
gate of the palace, with his followers, determined to carry out this
vow, and while he was thus engaged, eleven years passed over his
head.</p>
<p>And when the twelfth year came, his wife, who was in another land,
grieved at her long separation from him, sent him a letter; and he
happened to be reading this &Aacute;ry&aacute; verse which she had
written in the letter, at night, by the light of a candle, when the
king, who had gone out in search of adventures, was listening
concealed, &ldquo;Hot, long, and tremulous, do these sighs issue forth
from me, during thy absence, my lord, but not the breath of life,
hard-hearted woman that I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had heard this read over and over again by the
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i>, he went to his palace and said to
himself, &ldquo;This <i><span class="corr" id="xd27e17261" title=
"Source: k&aacute;rpatika">k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</span></i>, whose
wife is in such despondency, has long endured affliction, and if his
objects are not gained, he will, when this twelfth year is at an end,
yield his breath. So I must not let him wait any longer.&rdquo; After
going through these reflections, the king at once sent a female slave,
and summoned that <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i>. And after he had
caused a grant to be written, he gave him this order, &ldquo;My good
fellow, go towards the northern quarter through
Omk&aacute;rap&iacute;&#7789;ha; there live on the proceeds of a
village of the name of Kha&#7751;&#7693;ava&#7789;aka, which I give you
by this grant; you will find it by asking your way as you go
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king had said this, he gave the grant into his hands; and
the <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> went off by night without telling his
followers. He was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb615" href="#pb615"
name="pb615">615</a>]</span>dissatisfied, saying to himself, &ldquo;How
shall I be helped to conquer my enemies by a single village that will
rather disgrace me? Nevertheless my sovereign&rsquo;s orders must be
obeyed.&rdquo; So he slowly went on, and having passed
Omk&aacute;rap&iacute;&#7789;ha, he saw in a distant forest many
maidens playing, and then he asked them this question, &ldquo;Do you
know where Kha&#7751;&#7693;ava&#7789;aka is?&rdquo; When they heard
that, they answered, &ldquo;We do not know; go on further; our father
lives only ten <i>yojanas</i> from here; ask him; he may perhaps know
of that village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the maidens had said this to him, the
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> went on, and beheld their father, a
R&aacute;kshasa of terrific appearance. He said to him,
&ldquo;Whereabouts here is Kha&#7751;&#7693;ava&#7789;aka? Tell me, my
good fellow.&rdquo; And the R&aacute;kshasa, quite taken aback by his
courage, said to him, &ldquo;What have you got to do there? The city
has been long deserted; but if you must go, listen; this road in front
of you divides into two: take the one on the left hand, and go on until
you reach the main entrance of <span class="corr" id="xd27e17282"
title="Source: Kha&#7751;&#7693;avataka">Kha&#7751;&#7693;ava&#7789;aka</span>,
the lofty ramparts on each side of which make it attract the
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the R&aacute;kshasa had told him this, he went on, and reached
that main street, and entered that city, which, though of heavenly
beauty, was deserted and awe-inspiring. And in it he entered the
palace, which was surrounded with seven zones, and ascended the upper
storey of it, which was made of jewels and gold. There he saw a
gem-bestudded throne, and he sat down on it. Thereupon a
R&aacute;kshasa came with a wand in his hand, and said to him,
&ldquo;Mortal, why have you sat down here on the king&rsquo;s
throne?&rdquo; When the resolute <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i>
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#347;akti heard this, he said, &ldquo;I am lord
here; and you are tribute-paying house-holders whom king
Vikram&aacute;ditya has made over to me by his grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the R&aacute;kshasa heard that, he looked at the grant, and
bowing before him, said, &ldquo;You are king here, and I am your
warder; for the decrees of king Vikram&aacute;ditya are binding
everywhere.&rdquo; When the R&aacute;kshasa had said this, he summoned
all the subjects, and the ministers and the king&rsquo;s retinue
presented themselves there; and that city was filled with an army of
four kinds of troops. And every one paid his respects to the
<i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i>; and he was delighted, and performed his
bathing and his other ceremonies with royal luxury.</p>
<p>Then, having become a king, he said to himself with amazement;
&ldquo;Astonishing truly is the power of king Vikram&aacute;ditya; and
strangely unexampled is the depth of his dignified reserve, in that he
bestows a kingdom like this and calls it a village!&rdquo; Full of
amazement at this, he remained there ruling as a king: and
Vikram&aacute;ditya supported his followers in Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>And after some days this <i>k&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika</i> become a king
went eagerly to pay his respects to king Vikram&aacute;ditya, shaking
the earth with his army. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb616" href=
"#pb616" name="pb616">616</a>]</span>And when he arrived and threw
himself at the feet of Vikram&aacute;ditya, that king said to him,
&ldquo;Go and put a stop to the sighs of your wife who sent you the
letter.&rdquo; When the king despatched him with these words,
K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#347;akti, full of wonder, went with his friends to
his own land. There he drove out his kinsmen, and delighted his wife,
who had been long pining for him; and having gained more even than he
had ever wished for, enjoyed the most glorious royal fortune.</p>
<p>So wonderful were the deeds of king Vikram&aacute;ditya.</p>
<p>Now one day he saw a Br&aacute;hman with every hair on his head and
body standing on end; and he said to him, &ldquo;What has reduced you,
Br&aacute;hman, to this state?&rdquo; Then the Br&aacute;hman told him
his story in the following words:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Devasv&aacute;min the permanently horripilant
Br&aacute;hman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a
Br&aacute;hman of the name of Agnisv&aacute;min, a great maintainer of
the sacrificial fire; and I am his son, Devasv&aacute;min by name. And
I married the daughter of a Br&aacute;hman who lived in a distant land,
and because she was a child, I left her in her father&rsquo;s house.
One day I mounted a mare, and went with one servant to my
father-in-law&rsquo;s house to fetch her. There my father-in-law
welcomed me; and I set out from his house with my wife, who was mounted
on the mare, and had one maid with her.</p>
<p>And when we had got half way, my wife got off the mare, and went to
the bank of the river, pretending that she wanted to drink water. And
as she remained a long time without coming back, I sent the servant,
who was with me, to the bank of the river to look for her. And as he
also remained a long time without coming back, I went there myself,
leaving the maid to take care of the mare. And when I went and looked,
I found that my wife&rsquo;s mouth was stained with blood, and that she
had devoured my servant, and left nothing of him but the
bones.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17316src" href="#xd27e17316" name=
"xd27e17316src">5</a> In my terror I left her, and went back to find
the mare, and lo! her maid had in the same way eaten that. Then I fled
from the place, and the fright I got on that occasion still remains in
me, so that even now I cannot prevent the hair on my head and body from
standing on end.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17322src" href=
"#xd27e17322" name="xd27e17322src">6</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So you, king, are my only hope.&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman said this, Vikram&aacute;ditya by his sovereign fiat
relieved him of all fear. Then the king said, &ldquo;Out on it! One
cannot repose any confidence in women, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb617" href="#pb617" name="pb617">617</a>]</span>they
are full of daring wickedness.&rdquo; When the king said this, a
minister remarked, &ldquo;Yes, king! women are fully as wicked as you
say. By the bye, have you not heard what happened to the Br&aacute;hman
Agni&#347;arman here?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lives in this very city a Br&aacute;hman named
Agni&#347;arman, the son of Soma&#347;arman; whom his parents loved as
their life, but who was a fool and ignorant of every branch of
knowledge. He married the daughter of a Br&aacute;hman in the city of
Vardham&aacute;na; but her father, who was rich, would not let her
leave his house, on the ground that she was a mere child.</p>
<p>And when she grew up, Agni&#347;arman&rsquo;s parents said to him,
&ldquo;Son, why do you not now go and fetch your wife?&rdquo; When
Agni&#347;arman heard that, the stupid fellow went off alone to fetch
her, without taking leave of his parents. When he left his house a
partridge appeared on his right hand, and a jackal howled on his left
hand, a sure prophet of evil.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17347src"
href="#xd27e17347" name="xd27e17347src">8</a> And the fool welcomed the
omen saying, &ldquo;Hail! Hail!&rdquo; and when the deity presiding
over the omen heard it, she laughed at him unseen. And when he reached
his father-in-law&rsquo;s place, and was about to enter it, a partridge
appeared on his right, and a jackal on his left, boding evil. And again
he welcomed the omen, exclaiming &ldquo;Hail! Hail!&rdquo; and again
the goddess of the omen, hearing it, laughed at him unseen. And that
goddess presiding over the omen said to herself, &ldquo;Why, this fool
welcomes bad luck as if it were good! So I must give him the luck which
he welcomes, I must contrive to save his life.&rdquo; While the goddess
was going through these reflections, Agni&#347;arman entered his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and was joyfully welcomed. And his
father-in-law and his family asked him, why he had come alone, and he
answered them, &ldquo;I came without telling any one at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he bathed and dined in the appropriate manner, and when night
came on, his wife came to his sleeping apartment adorned. But he fell
asleep fatigued with the journey; and then she went out to visit a
paramour of hers, a thief, who had been impaled. But, while she was
embracing his body, the demon that had entered it, bit off her nose;
and she fled thence in fear. And she went and placed an
unsheathed<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17352src" href="#xd27e17352"
name="xd27e17352src">9</a> dagger at her sleeping husband&rsquo;s side;
and cried out loud enough for all her relations to hear, &ldquo;Alas!
Alas! I am murdered; this wicked husband of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb618" href="#pb618" name="pb618">618</a>]</span>mine
has got up and without any cause actually cut off my nose.&rdquo; When
her relations heard that, they came, and seeing that her nose was cut
off, they beat Agni&#347;arman with sticks and other weapons. And the
next day they reported the matter to the king, and by his orders they
made him over to the executioners, to be put to death, as having
injured his innocent wife.</p>
<p>But when he was being taken to the place of execution, the goddess
presiding over that omen, who had seen the proceedings of his wife
during the night, said to herself, &ldquo;This man has reaped the fruit
of the evil omens, but as he said, &lsquo;Hail! Hail!&rsquo; I must
save him from execution.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the goddess
exclaimed unseen from the air, &ldquo;Executioners, this young
Br&aacute;hman is innocent; you must not put him to death: go and see
the nose between the teeth of the impaled thief.&rdquo; When she had
said this, she related the proceedings of his wife during the night.
Then the executioners, believing the story, represented it to the king
by the mouth of the warder, and the king, seeing the nose between the
teeth of the thief, remitted the capital sentence passed on
Agni&#347;arman, and sent him home; and punished that wicked wife, and
imposed a penalty on her relations<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17364src"
href="#xd27e17364" name="xd27e17364src">10</a> also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such, king, is the character of women.&rdquo; When that
minister had said this, King Vikram&aacute;ditya approved his saying,
exclaiming, &ldquo;So it is.&rdquo; Then the cunning M&uacute;ladeva,
who was near the king, said, &ldquo;King, are there no good women,
though some are bad? Are there no mango-creepers, as well as poisonous
creepers? In proof that there are good women, hear what happened to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">I went once to P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra with
&#346;a&#347;in, thinking that it was the home of polished wits, and
longing to make trial of their cleverness. In a tank outside that city
I saw a woman washing clothes, and I put this question to her,
&ldquo;Where do travellers stay here?&rdquo; The old woman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb619" href="#pb619" name="pb619">619</a>]</span>gave
me an evasive answer, saying, &ldquo;Here the Brahmany ducks stay on
the banks, the fish in the water, the bees in the lotuses, but I have
never seen any part where travellers stay.&rdquo; When I got this
answer, I was quite nonplussed, and I entered the city with
&#346;a&#347;in.</p>
<p>There &#346;a&#347;in saw a boy crying at the door of a house, with
a warm<a class="noteref" id="xd27e17389src" href="#xd27e17389" name=
"xd27e17389src">12</a> rice-pudding on a plate in front of him, and he
said, &ldquo;Dear me! this is a foolish child not to eat the pudding in
front of him, but to vex himself with useless weeping.&rdquo; When the
child heard this, he wiped his eyes, and said laughing, &ldquo;You
fools do not know the advantages I get by crying. The pudding gradually
cools and so becomes nice, and another good comes out of it; my phlegm
is diminished thereby. These are the advantages I derive from crying; I
do not cry out of folly; but you country bumpkins are fools because you
do not see what I do it for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boy said this, &#346;a&#347;in and I were quite abashed at
our stupidity, and we went away astonished to another part of the town.
There we saw a beautiful young lady on the trunk of a mango-tree,
gathering mangoes, while her attendants stood at its foot. We said to
the young lady, &ldquo;Give us also some mangoes, fair one.&rdquo; And
she answered, &ldquo;Would you like to eat your mangoes cold or
hot?&rdquo; When I heard that, I said to her, wishing to penetrate the
mystery, &ldquo;We should like, lovely one, to eat some warm ones
first, and to have the others afterwards.&rdquo; When she heard this,
she flung down some mango-fruits into the dust on the ground. We blew
the dust off them and then ate them. Then the young lady and her
attendants laughed, and she said to us, &ldquo;I first gave you these
warm mangoes, and you cooled them by blowing on them, and then ate
them; catch these cool ones, which will not require blowing on, in your
clothes.&rdquo; When she had said this, she threw some more fruits into
the flaps of our garments.</p>
<p>We took them, and left that place thoroughly ashamed of ourselves.
Then I said to &#346;a&#347;in and my other companions, &ldquo;Upon my
word I must marry this clever girl, and pay her out for the way in
which she has made a fool of me; otherwise what becomes of my
reputation for sharpness?&rdquo; When I said this to them, they found
out her father&rsquo;s house, and on a subsequent day we went there
disguised so that we could not be recognised.</p>
<p>And while we were reading the Veda there, her father the
Br&aacute;hman Yajnasv&aacute;min came up to us, and said, &ldquo;Where
do you come from?&rdquo; We said to that rich and noble Br&aacute;hman,
&ldquo;We have come here from the city of M&aacute;y&aacute;pur&iacute;
to study;&rdquo; thereupon he said to us, &ldquo;Then stay the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb620" href="#pb620" name=
"pb620">620</a>]</span>next four months in my house; shew me this
favour, as you have come from a distant country.&rdquo; When we heard
this, we said, &ldquo;We will do what you say, Br&aacute;hman, if you
will give us, at the end of the four months, whatever we may ask
for.&rdquo; When we said this to Yajnasv&aacute;min, he answered,
&ldquo;If you ask for anything that it is in my power to give, I will
certainly give it.&rdquo; When he made this promise, we remained in his
house. And when the four months were at an end, we said to that
Br&aacute;hman, &ldquo;We are going away, so give us what we ask for,
as you long ago promised to do.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo; Then &#346;a&#347;in pointed to me and said, &ldquo;Give
your daughter to this man, who is our chief.&rdquo; Then the
Br&aacute;hman Yajnasv&aacute;min, being bound by his promise, thought,
&ldquo;These fellows have tricked me; never mind; there can be no harm
in it; he is a deserving youth.&rdquo; So he gave me his daughter with
the usual ceremonies.</p>
<p>And when night came, I said laughing to the bride in the bridal
chamber, &ldquo;Do you remember those warm and those cool
mangoes?&rdquo; When she heard this, she recognised me, and said with a
smile, &ldquo;Yes, country bumpkins are tricked in this way by city
wits.&rdquo; Then I said to her, &ldquo;Rest you fair, city wit; I vow
that I the country bumpkin will desert you and go far away.&rdquo; When
she heard this, she also made a vow, saying, &ldquo;I too am resolved,
for my part, that a son of mine by you shall bring you back
again.&rdquo; When we had made one another these promises, she went to
sleep with her face turned away, and I put my ring on her finger, while
she was asleep. Then I went out, and joining my companions, started for
my native city of Ujjayin&iacute;, wishing to make trial of her
cleverness.</p>
<p>The Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s daughter, not seeing me next morning,
when she woke up, but seeing a ring on her finger marked with my name,
said to herself, &ldquo;So he has deserted me, and gone off; well, he
has been as good as his word; and I must keep mine too, dismissing all
regrets. And I see by this ring that his name is M&uacute;ladeva; so no
doubt he is that very M&uacute;ladeva, who is so renowned for cunning.
And people say that his permanent home is Ujjayin&iacute;; so I must go
there, and accomplish my object by an artifice.&rdquo; When she had
made up her mind to this, she went and made this false statement to her
father, &ldquo;My father, my husband has deserted me immediately after
marriage; and how can I live here happily without him; so I will go on
a pilgrimage to holy waters, and will so mortify this accursed
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, and having wrung a permission from her unwilling
father, she started off from her house with her wealth and her
attendants. She procured a splendid dress suitable to a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i>, and travelling along she reached Ujjayin&iacute;,
and entered it as the chief beauty of the world. And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb621" href="#pb621" name=

of her scheme, that young Br&aacute;hman lady assumed the name of
Sumangal&aacute;. And her servants proclaimed everywhere, &ldquo;A
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> named Sumangal&aacute; has come from
K&aacute;mar&uacute;pa, and her goodwill is only to be procured by the
most lavish expenditure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a distinguished <i>het&aelig;ra</i> of Ujjayin&iacute;, named
Devadatt&aacute;, came to her, and gave her her own palace worthy of a
king, to dwell in by herself. And when she was established there, my
friend &#346;a&#347;in first sent a message to her by a servant,
saying, &ldquo;Accept a present from me which is won by your great
reputation.&rdquo; But Sumangal&aacute; sent back this message by the
servant, &ldquo;The lover who obeys my commands may enter here: I do
not care for a present, nor for other beast-like men.&rdquo;
&#346;a&#347;in accepted the terms, and repaired at night-fall to her
palace.</p>
<p>And when he came to the first door of the palace, and had himself
announced, the door-keeper said to him, &ldquo;Obey our lady&rsquo;s
commands. Even though you may have bathed, you must bathe again here;
otherwise you cannot be admitted.&rdquo; When &#346;a&#347;in heard
this, he agreed to bathe again as he was bid. Then he was bathed and
anointed all over by her female slaves, in private, and while this was
going on, the first watch of the night passed away. When he arrived,
having bathed, at the second door, the door-keeper said to him,
&ldquo;You have bathed; now adorn yourself appropriately.&rdquo; He
consented, and thereupon the lady&rsquo;s female slaves adorned him,
and meanwhile the second watch of the night came to an end. Then he
reached the door of the third zone, and there the guards said to him,
&ldquo;Take a meal, and then enter.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; and then the female slaves managed to delay him with
various dishes until the third watch passed away. Then he reached at
last the fourth door, that of the lady&rsquo;s private apartments, but
there the door-keeper reproached him in the following words,
&ldquo;Away, boorish suitor, lest you draw upon yourself misfortune. Is
the last watch of the night a proper time for paying the first visit to
a lady?&rdquo; When &#346;a&#347;in had been turned away in this
contemptuous style by the warder, who seemed like an incarnation of
untimeliness, he went away home with countenance sadly fallen.</p>
<p>In the same way that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s daughter, who had
assumed the name of Sumangal&aacute;, disappointed many other visitors.
When I heard of it, I was moved with curiosity, and after sending a
messenger to and fro I went at night splendidly adorned to her house.
There I propitiated the warders at every door with magnificent
presents, and I reached without delay the private apartments of that
lady. And as I had arrived in time I was allowed by the door-keepers to
pass the door, and I entered and saw my wife, whom I did not recognise,
owing to her being disguised as a <i>het&aelig;ra</i>. But she knew me
again, and she advanced towards me, and paid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb622" href="#pb622" name="pb622">622</a>]</span>me
all the usual civilities, made me sit down on a couch, and treated me
with the attentions of a cunning <i>het&aelig;ra</i>. Then I passed the
night with that wife of mine, who was the most beautiful woman of the
world, and I became so attached to her, that I could not leave the
house in which she was staying.</p>
<p>She too was devoted to me, and never left my side, until, after some
days, the blackness of the tips of her breasts shewed that she was
pregnant. Then the clever woman forged a letter, and shewed it to me,
saying, &ldquo;The king my sovereign has sent me a letter: read
it.&rdquo; Then I opened the letter and read as follows, &ldquo;The
august sovereign of the fortunate K&aacute;mar&uacute;pa,
M&aacute;nasinha, sends thence this order to Sumangal&aacute;,
&lsquo;Why do you remain so long absent? Return quickly, dismissing
your desire of seeing foreign countries.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had read this letter, she said to me with affected grief,
&ldquo;I must depart; do not be angry with me; I am subject to the will
of others.&rdquo; Having made this false excuse, she returned to her
own city P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra: but I did not follow her, though
deeply in love with her, as I supposed that she was not her own
mistress.</p>
<p>And when she was in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, she gave birth in due
time to a son. And that boy grew up and learned all the
accomplishments. And when he was twelve years old, that boy in a
childish freak happened to strike with a creeper a fisherman&rsquo;s
son of the same age. When the fisherman&rsquo;s son was beaten, he flew
in a passion and said, &ldquo;You beat me, though nobody knows who your
father is; for your mother roamed about in foreign lands, and you were
born to her by some husband or other.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e17444src" href="#xd27e17444" name="xd27e17444src">13</a></p>
<p>When this was said to the boy, he was put to shame; so he went and
said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, who and where is my father? Tell
me!&rdquo; Then his mother, the daughter of the Br&aacute;hman,
reflected a moment, and said to him, &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s name is
M&uacute;ladeva: he deserted me, and went to Ujjayin&iacute;.&rdquo;
After she had said this, she told him her whole story from the
beginning. Then the boy said to her, &ldquo;Mother, then I will go and
bring my father back a captive; I will make your promise
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this to his mother, and having been told by her how to
recognise me, the boy set out thence, and reached this city of
Ujjayin&iacute;. And he came and saw me playing dice in the
gambling-hall, making certain of my identity from the description his
mother had given him, and he conquered in play all who were there. And
he astonished every one there by shewing such remarkable cunning,
though he was a mere child. Then he gave away to the needy all the
money he had won at play. And at night he artfully came and stole my
bedstead from under me, letting me gently down on a heap of cotton,
while I was asleep. So when I woke up, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb623" href="#pb623" name="pb623">623</a>]</span>and saw myself on a
heap of cotton, without a bedstead, I was at once filled with mixed
feelings of shame, amusement and astonishment.</p>
<p>Then, king, I went at my leisure to the market-place, and roaming
about, I saw that boy there selling the bedstead. So I went up to him
and said, &ldquo;For what price will you give me this bedstead?&rdquo;
Then the boy said to me, &ldquo;You cannot get the bedstead for money,
crest-jewel of cunning ones; but you may get it by telling some strange
and wonderful story.&rdquo; When I heard that, I said to him,
&ldquo;Then I will tell you a marvellous tale. And if you understand it
and admit that it is really true, you may keep the bedstead; but if you
say that it is not true and that you do not believe it,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e17455src" href="#xd27e17455" name=
"xd27e17455src">14</a> you will be illegitimate, and I shall get back
the bedstead. On this condition I agree to tell you a marvel; and now
listen!&mdash;Formerly there was a famine in the kingdom of a certain
king; that king himself cultivated the back of the beloved of the boar
with great loads of spray from the chariots of the snakes. Enriched
with the grain thus produced the king put a stop to the famine among
his subjects, and gained the esteem of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I said this, the boy laughed and said, &ldquo;The chariots of
the snakes are clouds; the beloved of the boar is the earth, for she is
said to have been most dear to Vish&#7751;u in his Boar incarnation;
and what is there to be astonished at in the fact that rain from the
clouds made grain to spring on the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the cunning boy had said this, he went on to say to me, who was
astonished at his cleverness, &ldquo;Now I will tell you a strange
tale. If you understand it, and admit that it is really true, I will
give you back this bedstead, otherwise you shall be my
slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered &ldquo;Agreed;&rdquo; and then the cunning boy said this,
&ldquo;Prince of knowing ones, there was born long ago on this earth a
wonderful boy, who, as soon as he was born, made the earth tremble with
the weight of his feet, and when he grew bigger, stepped into another
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boy said this, I, not knowing what he meant, answered him,
&ldquo;It is false; there is not a word of truth in it.&rdquo; Then the
boy said to me, &ldquo;Did not Vish&#7751;u, as soon as he was born,
stride across the earth, in the form of a dwarf, and make it tremble?
And did he not, on that same occasion, grow bigger, and step into
heaven? So you have been conquered by me, and reduced to slavery. And
these people present in the market are witnesses to our agreement. So,
wherever I go, you must come along with me.&rdquo; When the resolute
boy had said this, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb624" href=
"#pb624" name="pb624">624</a>]</span>laid hold of my arm with his hand;
and all the people there testified to the justice of his claim.</p>
<p>Then, having made me his prisoner, bound by my own agreement, he,
accompanied by his attendants, took me to his mother in the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. And then his mother looked at him, and said
to me, &ldquo;My husband, my promise has to-day been made good, I have
had you brought here by a son of mine begotten by you.&rdquo; When she
had said this, she related the whole story in the presence of all.</p>
<p>Then all her relations respectfully congratulated her on having
accomplished her object by her wisdom, and on having had her disgrace
wiped out by her son. And I, having been thus fortunate, lived there
for a long time with that wife, and that son, and then returned to this
city of Ujjayin&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, king, honourable matrons are devoted to their
husbands, and it is not the case that all women are always bad.&rdquo;
When king Vikram&aacute;ditya had heard this speech from the mouth of
M&uacute;ladeva, he rejoiced with his ministers. Thus hearing, and
seeing, and doing wonders, that king Vikram&aacute;ditya<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e17481src" href="#xd27e17481" name=
"xd27e17481src">15</a> conquered and enjoyed all the divisions of the
earth.<a id="xd27e17484" name="xd27e17484"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;When the hermit Kanva had told during the night this story of
Vishama&#347;&iacute;la, dealing with separations and reunions, he went
on to say to me who was cut off from the society of
Madanamanchuk&aacute;; &lsquo;Thus do unexpected separations and
reunions of beings take place, and so you, Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
shall soon be reunited to your beloved. Have recourse to patience, and
you shall enjoy for a long time, son of the king of Vatsa, surrounded
by your wives and ministers, the position of a beloved emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rsquo; This admonition of the hermit Kanva enabled
me to recover patience; and so I got through my time of separation, and
I gradually obtained wives, magic<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">,</span> science, and the sovereignty over the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. And I told you before, great hermits, how I
obtained all these by the favour of &#346;iva, the giver of
boons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By telling this his tale, in the hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta delighted his mother&rsquo;s brother
Gop&aacute;laka and all the hermits. And after he had passed there the
days of the rainy season, he took leave of his uncle and the hermits in
the grove of asceticism, and mounting his chariot, departed thence with
his wives and his ministers, filling the air with the hosts of his
Vidy&aacute;dharas. And in course of time he reached the mountain of
&#7770;ishabha his dwelling-place; and he remained there delighting in
the enjoyments of empire, in the midst of the kings of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, with queen Madanamanchuk&aacute;, and
Ratnaprabh&aacute; and his other wives; and his life lasted for a
<i>kalpa</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb625" href="#pb625" name=
"pb625">625</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is the story called V&#7771;ihatkath&aacute;, told long ago, on
the summit of mount Kail&aacute;sa, by the undaunted<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e17499src" href="#xd27e17499" name="xd27e17499src">16</a>
&#346;iva, at the request of the daughter of the Him&aacute;laya, and
then widely diffused in the world by Pushpadanta and his fellows, who
were born on the earth wearing the forms of K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana and
others, in consequence of a curse. And on that occasion that god her
husband attached the following blessing to this tale, &ldquo;Whoever
reads this tale that issued from my mouth, and whoever listens to it
with attention, and whoever possesses it, shall soon be released from
his sins, and triumphantly attain the condition of a splendid
Vidy&aacute;dhara, and enter my everlasting world.&rdquo;</p>

Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well.&rdquo; At
any rate there is a slight resemblance in the leading idea of the two
stories. It bears a close resemblance to the story of Sorfarina, No. 36
in Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Sicilianische
M&auml;rchen</span>, and to that of Sapia in the Pentamerone of Basile.
In the Sicilian and in the Neapolitan tale a prince is angry with a
young lady who, when teaching him, gave him a box on the ear, and
marries her in order to avenge himself by ill-treating her; but finding
that he has, without suspecting it, had three children by her, he is
obliged to seek a reconciliation. Dr. K&ouml;hler in his note on the
Sicilian tale gives no other parallel than Basile&rsquo;s tale, which
