<p>Changed 26-AUG-2009: removed P3 qualifier comment only.

<p>A huge collection of ancient Indian stories, translated from Sanskrit.

<p>This text contains a lot letters with diacritic marks. Please proof them following the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#d_chars">standard guidelines for diacritics</a>. I've kept the resolution of the scans high, so that you can enlarge to determine the exact diacritic used, if necessary.

<p>Sometimes, the S with acute accent looks like an S followed by a prime. Also in this case, please proof it as if it is an S with acute accent, that is, as <code>['S]</code>.

<p>Section headers are set into the text in italics. Please move this text, and place it above the paragraph it belongs to, as if it is a section header.

<p>The Sanskrit names in this work are not yet in the word-check dictionary. Please use the word-check interface in P1 to suggest those names for inclusion.

<p>The scans of this book are available from The Internet Archive. A few pages are difficult to read, due to blurring or to folded edges. Please notify me if you cannot resolve the text, and I will help in finding out the correct reading.
