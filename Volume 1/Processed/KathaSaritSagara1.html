<p>This book is precisely on the model of that from which it is taken,
there is not even the slightest deviation, only such language is
selected as tends to abridge the prolixity of the work; the observance
of propriety and natural connexion, and the joining together of the
portions of the poem so as not to interfere with the spirit of the
stories, are as far as possible kept in view: I have not made this
attempt through desire of a reputation for ingenuity, but in order to
facilitate the recollection of a multitude of various tales.</p>
<p>There is a mountain celebrated under the name of Himavat, haunted by
Kinnaras, Gandharvas, and Vidy&aacute;dharas, a very monarch of mighty
hills, whose glory has attained such an eminence among mountains that
Bhav&aacute;n&iacute; the mother of the three worlds deigned to become
his daughter; the northernmost summit thereof is a great peak named
Kail&aacute;sa, which towers many thousand <i>yojanas</i> in the
air,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1714src" href="#xd27e1714" name=
"xd27e1714src">4</a> and as it were, laughs forth with its snowy gleams
this boast&mdash;&ldquo;Mount Mandara<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1720src" href="#xd27e1720" name="xd27e1720src">5</a> did not
become white as mortar even when the ocean was churned with it, but I
have become such without an effort.&rdquo; There dwells Mahe&#347;vara
the beloved of P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, the chief of things animate and
inanimate, attended upon by Ga&#7751;as, Vidy&aacute;dharas and
Siddhas. In the upstanding yellow tufts of his matted hair, the new
moon enjoys the delight of touching the eastern mountain yellow in the
evening twilight. When he drove his trident into the heart of Andhaka,
the king of the Asuras, though he was only one, the dart which that
monarch had infixed in the heart of the three worlds was, strange to
say, extracted. The image of his toe-nails being reflected in the
crest-jewels of the gods and Asuras made them seem as if they had been
presented with half moons by his favour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1723src" href="#xd27e1723" name="xd27e1723src">6</a> Once on a
time that lord, the husband of P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, was gratified
with praises by his wife, having gained confidence as she sat in secret
with him; the moon-crested one attentive to her praise and delighted,
placed her on his lap, and said, &ldquo;What can I do to please
thee?&rdquo; Then the daughter of the mountain spake&mdash;&ldquo;My
lord, if thou art satisfied with me, then tell me some delightful story
that is quite new.&rdquo; And &#346;iva said to her, &ldquo;What can
there be in the world, my beloved, present, past, or future that thou
dost not know?&rdquo; Then that goddess, beloved of &#346;iva,
importuned him eagerly because she was proud in soul on account of his
affection.</p>
<p>Then &#346;iva wishing to flatter her, began by telling her a very
short story, referring to her own divine power. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Once on a time<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1731src" href=
"#xd27e1731" name="xd27e1731src">7</a> Brahm&aacute; and
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a roaming through the world in order to
behold me, came to the foot of Himavat. Then they beheld there in front
of them a great flame-linga;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1737src" href=
"#xd27e1737" name="xd27e1737src">8</a> in order to discover the end of
it, one of them went up, and the other down; and when they could not
find the end of it, they proceeded to propitiate me by means of
austerities: and I appeared to them and bade them ask for some boon:
hearing that Brahm&aacute; asked me to become his son; on that account
he has ceased to be worthy of worship, disgraced by his overweening
presumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that god N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a craved a boon of
me, saying&mdash;Oh revered one, may I become devoted to thy service!
Then he became incarnate, and was born as mine in thy form; for thou
art the same as N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a, the power of me
all-powerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover thou wast my wife in a former birth.&rdquo; When
&#346;iva had thus spoken, P&aacute;rvat&iacute; asked, &ldquo;How can
I have been thy wife in a former birth?&rdquo; Then &#346;iva answered
her. &ldquo;Long ago to the Praj&aacute;pati Daksha were born many
daughters, and amongst them thou, O goddess! He gave thee in marriage
to me, and the others to Dharma and the rest of the gods. Once on a
time he invited all his sons-in-law to a sacrifice. But I alone was not
included in the invitation; thereupon thou didst ask him to tell thee
why thy husband was not invited. Then he uttered a speech which pierced
thy ears like a poisoned needle; &lsquo;Thy husband wears a necklace of
skulls; how can he be invited to a sacrifice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then thou, my beloved, didst in anger abandon thy body,
exclaiming,&mdash;&lsquo;This father of mine is a villain; what profit
have I then in this carcase sprung from him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thereupon in wrath I destroyed that sacrifice of Daksha.
Then thou wast born as the daughter of the mount of snow, as the
moon&rsquo;s digit springs from the sea. Then recall how I came to the
Him&aacute;laya in order to perform austerities; and thy father ordered
thee to do me service as his guest: and there the god of love who had
been sent by the gods in order that they might obtain from me a son to
oppose T&aacute;raka, was consumed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1755src"
href="#xd27e1755" name="xd27e1755src">9</a> when endeavouring to pierce
me, having obtained a favourable opportunity. Then I was purchased by
thee,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1758src" href="#xd27e1758" name=
"xd27e1758src">10</a> the enduring one, with severe austerities, and I
accepted this proposal of thine, my beloved, in order that I might add
this merit to my stock.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1761src" href=
"#xd27e1761" name="xd27e1761src">11</a> Thus it is clear that thou wast
my wife in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>a former birth. What else shall I tell thee?&rdquo;
Thus &#346;iva spake, and when he had ceased, the goddess transported
with wrath, exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art a deceiver; thou wilt not
tell me a pleasing tale even though I ask thee: Do I not know that thou
worshippest Sandhy&aacute;, and bearest Gang&aacute; on thy
head?&rdquo; Hearing that, &#346;iva proceeded to conciliate her and
promised to tell her a wonderful tale: then she dismissed her anger.
She herself gave the order that no one was to enter where they were;
Nandin<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1775src" href="#xd27e1775" name=
"xd27e1775src">12</a> thereupon kept the door, and &#346;iva began to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods are supremely blessed, men are ever miserable, the
actions of demigods are exceedingly charming, therefore I now proceed
to relate to thee the history of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; While
&#346;iva was thus speaking to his consort, there arrived a favourite
dependant of &#346;iva&rsquo;s, Pushpadanta, best of
Ga&#7751;as,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1780src" href="#xd27e1780"
name="xd27e1780src">13</a> and his entrance was forbidden by Nandin who
was guarding the door. Curious to know why even he had been forbidden
to enter at that time without any apparent reason, Pushpadanta
immediately entered, making use of his magic power attained by devotion
to prevent his being seen, and when he had thus entered, he heard all
the extraordinary and wonderful adventures of the seven
Vidy&aacute;dharas being narrated by the trident-bearing god, and
having heard them he in turn went and narrated them to his wife
Jay&aacute;; for who can hide wealth or a secret from women?
Jay&aacute; the doorkeeper being filled with wonder went and recited it
in the presence of P&aacute;rvat&iacute;. How can women be expected to
restrain their speech? And then the daughter of the mountain flew into
a passion, and said to her husband, &ldquo;Thou didst not tell me any
extraordinary tale, for Jay&aacute; knows it also.&rdquo; Then the lord
of Um&aacute;, perceiving the truth by profound meditation, thus spake:
&ldquo;Pushpadanta employing the magic power of devotion entered in
where we were, and thus managed to hear it. He narrated it to
Jay&aacute;; no one else knows it, my beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having heard this, the goddess exceedingly enraged caused
Pushpadanta to be summoned, and cursed him, as he stood trembling
before her, saying, &ldquo;Become a mortal thou disobedient
servant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1785src" href="#xd27e1785"
name="xd27e1785src">14</a> She cursed also the Ga&#7751;a
M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n who presumed to intercede on his behalf. Then
the two fell at her feet together with Jay&aacute; and entreated her to
say when the curse would end, and the wife of &#346;iva slowly uttered
this speech&mdash;&ldquo;A Yaksha named Suprat&iacute;ka who has been
made a Pi&#347;&aacute;cha by the curse of Kuvera is residing in the
Vindhya forest under the name of K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti. When
thou shalt see him and, calling to mind thy origin, tell him this tale,
then, Pushpadanta, thou shalt be released from this curse. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>when M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n shall hear this tale
from K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, then K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti
shall be released, and thou, M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n, when thou hast
published it abroad, shalt be free also.&rdquo; Having thus spoken the
daughter of the mountain ceased, and immediately those Ga&#7751;as
disappeared instantaneously like flashes of lightning. Then it came to
pass in the course of time that Gaur&iacute; full of pity asked
&#346;iva, &ldquo;My lord, where on the earth have those excellent
Pramathas<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1796src" href="#xd27e1796" name=
"xd27e1796src">15</a> whom I cursed, been born?&rdquo; And the
moon-diademed god answered: &ldquo;My beloved, Pushpadanta has been
born under the name of Vararuchi in that great city which is called
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="n5.2src" href=
"#n5.2" name="n5.2src">16</a> Moreover M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n also has
been born in the splendid city called Supratish&#7789;hita under the
name of Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya. This, O goddess, is what has
befallen them.&rdquo; Having given her this information with grief
caused by recalling to mind the degradation of the servants that had
always been obedient to him, that lord continued to dwell with his
beloved in pleasure-arbours on the slopes of mount Kail&aacute;sa,
which were made of the branches of the Kalpa tree.<a class="noteref"

Its precise site has not been ascertained, but it was probably
somewhere in the Doab&aacute;, or at any rate not far from the west
bank of the Yamun&aacute;, as it bordered upon Magadha and was not far
from the Vindhya hills. It is said that there are ruins at

<p class="first">Then Pushpadanta wandering on the earth in the form of
a man, was known by the name of Vararuchi and K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana.
Having attained perfection in the sciences, and having served Nanda as
minister, being wearied out he went once on a time to visit the shrine
of Durg&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1817src" href="#xd27e1817"
name="xd27e1817src">1</a> And that goddess, being pleased with his

in stature like a <i>&#346;&aacute;la</i> tree. <span class=

K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti had seen him and respectfully clasped his
feet, K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana sitting down immediately spake to him.
&ldquo;Thou art an observer of the good custom<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e1839" title="Source: ,">;</span> how hast thou come into this
state?&rdquo; Having heard this K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti said to
K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana, who had shewn affection towards him,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e1842" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>I
know not of myself, but listen to what I heard from <span class="corr"
id="xd27e1845" title="Source: S&iacute;va">&#346;iva</span> at
Ujjayin&iacute; in the place where corpses are burnt; I proceed to tell
it thee.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The
adorable god was asked by Durg&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;Whence, my lord,
comes thy delight in skulls and burning-places?&rdquo; He thereupon
gave this answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago when all things had been destroyed at the end of a
Kalpa, the universe became water: I then cleft my thigh and let fall a
drop of blood; that drop falling into the water turned into an egg,
from that sprang the Supreme Soul,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1853src"
href="#xd27e1853" name="xd27e1853src">4</a> the Disposer; from him
proceeded Nature,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1861src" href="#xd27e1861"
name="xd27e1861src">5</a> created by me for the purpose of further
creation, and they created the other lords of created beings,<a class=

and those in turn the created beings, for which reason, my beloved, the
Supreme Soul is called in the world the grandfather. Having thus
created the world, animate and inanimate, that Spirit became
arrogant:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1870src" href="#xd27e1870" name=
"xd27e1870src">7</a> thereupon I cut off his head: then through regret
for what I had done, I undertook a difficult vow. So thus it comes to
pass that I carry skulls in my hand, and love the places where corpses
are burned. Moreover this world resembling a skull, rests in my hand;
for the two skull-shaped halves of the egg before mentioned are called
heaven and earth.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had thus spoken, I, being full
of curiosity, determined to listen; and P&aacute;rvat&iacute; again
said to her husband, &ldquo;After how long a time will that Pushpadanta
return to us?&rdquo; Hearing that, Mahe&#347;vara spoke to the goddess,
pointing me out to her; &ldquo;That Pi&#347;&aacute;cha whom thou
beholdest there, was once a Yaksha, a servant of Kuvera, the god of
wealth, and he had for a friend a R&aacute;kshasa named
Sth&uacute;la&#347;iras; and the lord of wealth perceiving that he
associated with that evil one, banished him to the wilds of the Vindhya
mountains. But his brother D&iacute;rghajangha fell at the feet of the
god, and humbly asked when the curse would end. Then the god of wealth
said&mdash;&ldquo;After thy brother has heard the great tale from
Pushpadanta, who has been born into this world in consequence of a
curse, and after he has in turn told it to M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n, who
owing to a curse has become a human being, he together with those two
Ga&#7751;as shall be released from the effects of the curse.&rdquo;
Such were the terms on which the god of wealth then ordained that
M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n should obtain remission from his curse here
below, and thou didst fix the same in the case of Pushpadanta;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>recall it to mind, my beloved.&rdquo; When I heard
that speech of &#346;iva, I came here overjoyed, knowing that the
calamity of my curse would be terminated by the arrival of Pushpadanta.
When K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti ceased after telling this story,
that moment Vararuchi remembered his origin, and exclaimed like one
aroused from sleep, &ldquo;I am that very Pushpadanta, hear that tale
from me.&rdquo; Thereupon K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana related to him the
seven great tales in seven hundred thousand verses, and then
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My lord, thou
art an incarnation of &#346;iva, who else knows this story? Through thy
favour that curse has almost left my body. Therefore tell me thy own
history from thy birth, thou mighty one, sanctify me yet further, if
the narrative may be revealed to such a one as I am.&rdquo; Then
Vararuchi, to gratify K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, who remained
prostrate before him, told all his history from his birth at full
length, in the following words:</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; there lived
a Br&aacute;hman called Somadatta, who also had the title of
Agni&#347;ikha, and his wife was called Vasudatt&aacute;. She was the
daughter of a hermit, and was born into the world in this position in
consequence of a curse; and I was born by her to this excellent
Br&aacute;hman, also in consequence of a curse. Now while I was still
quite a child my father died, but my mother continued to support me, as
I grew up, by severe drudgery; then one day two Br&aacute;hmans came to
our house to stop a night, exceedingly dusty with a long journey; and
while they were staying in our house there arose the noise of a tabor,
thereupon my mother said to me, sobbing, as she called to mind her
husband&mdash;&ldquo;there, my son, is your father&rsquo;s friend
Bhavananda, giving a dramatic entertainment.&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;I will go and see it, and will exhibit the whole of it to you,
with a recitation of all the speeches.&rdquo; On hearing that speech of
mine, those Br&aacute;hmans were astonished, but my mother said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;Come, my children, there is no doubt about the truth
of what he says; this boy will remember by heart everything that he has
heard once.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1883src" href=
"#xd27e1883" name="xd27e1883src">8</a> Then they, in order to test me,
recited to me a Pr&aacute;ti&#347;&aacute;khya<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1898src" href="#xd27e1898" name="xd27e1898src">9</a>; immediately
I repeated the whole in their presence, then I went with the two
Br&aacute;hmans and saw that play, and when I came home, I went through
the whole of it in front of my mother: then one of the Br&aacute;hmans,
named Vy&aacute;&#7693;i, having ascertained that I was able to
recollect a thing on hearing it once, told with submissive reverence
this tale to my mother.</p>
<p>Mother, in the city of Vetasa there were two Br&aacute;hman
brothers, Deva-Sw&aacute;min and Karambaka, who loved one another very
dearly; this Indradatta here is the son of one of them, and I am the
son of the other, and my name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>is Vy&aacute;&#7693;i. It came to pass
that my father died. Owing to grief for his loss, the father of
Indradatta went on the long journey,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1905src" href="#xd27e1905" name="xd27e1905src">10</a> and then
the hearts of our two mothers broke with grief; thereupon being orphans
though we had wealth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1910src" href=
"#xd27e1910" name="xd27e1910src">11</a> and, desiring to acquire
learning, we went to the southern region to supplicate the lord
K&aacute;rtikeya. And while we were engaged in austerities there, the
god gave us the following revelation in a dream. &ldquo;There is a city
called P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, the capital of king Nanda, and in it
there is a Br&aacute;hman, named Varsha, from him ye shall learn all
knowledge, therefore go there.&rdquo; Then we went to that city, and
when we made enquiries there, people said to us: &ldquo;There is a
blockhead of a Br&aacute;hman in this town, of the name of
Varsha.&rdquo; Immediately we went on with minds in a state of
suspense, and saw the house of Varsha in a miserable condition, made a
very ant-hill by mice, dilapidated by the cracking of the walls,
untidy,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1916src" href="#xd27e1916" name=
"xd27e1916src">12</a> deprived of eaves, looking like the very
birth-place of misery.</p>
<p>Then, seeing Varsha plunged in meditation within the house, we
approached his wife, who shewed us all proper hospitality; her body was
emaciated and begrimed, her dress tattered and dirty; she looked like
the incarnation of poverty, attracted thither by admiration for the
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s virtues. Bending humbly before her, we then told
her our circumstances, and the report of her husband&rsquo;s
imbecility, which we heard in the city. She exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;My
children, I am not ashamed to tell you the truth; listen! I will relate
the whole story,&rdquo; and then she, chaste lady, proceeded to tell us
the tale which follows:</p>
<p>There lived in this city an excellent Br&aacute;hman, named
&#346;ankara Sv&aacute;min, and he had two sons, my husband Varsha, and
Upavarsha; my husband was stupid and poor, and his younger brother was
just the opposite: and Upavarsha appointed his own wife to manage his
elder brother&rsquo;s house.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1929src" href=
"#xd27e1929" name="xd27e1929src">13</a> Then in the course of time, the
rainy season came on, and at this time the women are in the habit of
making a cake of flour mixed with molasses, of an unbecoming and
disgusting shape,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1934src" href="#xd27e1934"
name="xd27e1934src">14</a> and giving it to any Br&aacute;hman who is
thought to be a blockhead, and if they act thus, this cake is said to
remove their discomfort caused by bathing in the cold season, and their
exhaustion<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1942src" href="#xd27e1942" name=
"xd27e1942src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>caused by bathing in the hot weather; but when
it is given, Br&aacute;hmans refuse to receive it, on the ground that
the custom is a disgusting one. This cake was presented by my
sister-in-law to my husband, together with a sacrificial fee; he
received it, and brought it home with him, and got a severe scolding
from me; then he began to be inwardly consumed with grief at his own
stupidity, and went to worship the sole of the foot of the god
K&aacute;rtikeya: the god, pleased with his austerities, bestowed on
him the knowledge of all the sciences; and gave him this
order&mdash;&ldquo;When thou findest a Br&aacute;hman who can recollect
what he has heard only once, then thou mayest reveal
these&rdquo;&mdash;thereupon my husband returned home delighted, and
when he had reached home, told the whole story to me. From that time
forth, he has remained continually muttering prayers and meditating: so
find you some one who can remember anything after hearing it once, and
bring him here: if you do that, you will both of you undoubtedly obtain
all that you desire.</p>
<p>Having heard this from the wife of Varsha, and having immediately
given her a hundred gold pieces to relieve her poverty, we went out of
that city; then we wandered through the earth, and could not find
anywhere a person who could remember what he had only heard once: at
last we arrived tired out at your house to-day, and have found here
this boy, your son, who can recollect anything after once hearing it:
therefore give him us and let us go forth to acquire the commodity
knowledge.</p>
<p>Having heard this speech of Vy&aacute;&#7693;i, my mother said with
respect, &ldquo;All this tallies completely; I repose confidence in
your tale: for long ago at the birth of this my only son, a distinct
spiritual<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2013src" href="#xd27e2013" name=
"xd27e2013src">16</a> voice was heard from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>heaven.
&ldquo;A boy has been born who shall be able to remember what he has
heard once; he shall acquire knowledge from Varsha, and shall make the
science of grammar famous in the world, and he shall be called
Vararuchi by name, because whatever is excellent,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2018src" href="#xd27e2018" name="xd27e2018src">17</a> shall
please him.&rdquo; Having uttered this, the voice ceased. Consequently,
ever since this boy has grown big, I have been thinking, day and night,
where that teacher Varsha can be, and to-day I have been exceedingly
gratified at hearing it from your mouth. Therefore take him with you:
what harm can there be in it, he is your brother?&rdquo; When they
heard this speech of my mother&rsquo;s, those two, Vy&aacute;&#7693;i
and Indradatta, overflowing with joy, thought that night but a moment
in length. Then Vy&aacute;&#7693;i quickly gave his own wealth to my
mother to provide a feast, and desiring that I should be qualified to
read the Vedas, invested me with the Br&aacute;hmanical thread. Then
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i and Indradatta took me, who managed by my own
fortitude to control the excessive grief I felt at parting, while my
mother in taking leave of me could with difficulty suppress her tears,
and considering that the favour of K&aacute;rtikeya towards them had
now put forth blossom, set out rapidly from that city; then in course
of time we arrived at the house of the teacher Varsha: he too
considered that I was the favour of K&aacute;rtikeya arrived in bodily
form. The next day he placed us in front of him, and sitting down in a
consecrated spot, he began to recite the syllable Om with heavenly
voice. Immediately the Vedas with the six supplementary sciences rushed
into his mind, and then he began to teach them to us; then I retained
what the teacher told us after hearing it once, Vy&aacute;&#7693;i
after hearing it twice, and Indradatta after hearing it three times:
then the Br&aacute;hmans of the city hearing of a sudden that divine
sound, came at once from all quarters with wonder stirring in their
breasts to see what this new thing might be; and with their reverend
mouths loud in his praises honoured Varsha with low bows. Then
beholding that wonderful miracle, not only Upavarsha, but all the
citizens of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2026src" href="#xd27e2026" name="xd27e2026src">18</a> kept high
festival. Moreover the king Nanda of exalted fortune, seeing the power
of the boon of the son of &#346;iva, was delighted, and immediately
filled the house of Varsha with wealth, shewing him every mark of
respect.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2031src" href="#xd27e2031" name=

remarks (Essays on Sanskrit Literature, Vol. I, p. 165). &ldquo;The
contemporary existence of Nanda with Vararuchi and Vy&aacute;&#7693;i
is a circumstance of considerable interest in the literary history of
the Hindus, as the two latter are writers of note on philological
topics. Vararuchi is also called in this work K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana,
who is one of the earliest commentators on P&aacute;&#7751;ini. Nanda
is the predecessor or one of the predecessors of Chandragupta or
Sandrakottos; and consequently the chief institutes of Sanskrit grammar
are thus dated from the fourth century before the Christian era. We
need not suppose that Somadeva took the pains to be exact here; but it
is satisfactory to be made acquainted with the general impressions of a
writer who has not been biassed in any of his views by Paur&aacute;nik
legends and preposterous chronology.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<p class="first">There is a sanctifying place of pilgrimage, named
Kanakhala, at the point where the Ganges issues from the
hills,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2056src" href="#xd27e2056" name=
"xd27e2056src">2</a> where the sacred stream was brought down from the

the elephant of the gods, having cleft it asunder.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2059src" href="#xd27e2059" name="xd27e2059src">3</a> In that
place lived a certain Br&aacute;hman from the Deccan, performing
austerities in the company of his wife, and to him were born there
three sons. In the course of time he and his wife went to heaven, and
those sons of his went to a place named R&aacute;jag&#7771;iha, for the
sake of acquiring learning. And having studied the sciences there, the
three, grieved at their unprotected condition, went to the Deccan in
order to visit the shrine of the god K&aacute;rtikeya. Then they
reached a city named Chinchin&iacute; on the shore of the sea, and
dwelt in the house of a Br&aacute;hman named Bhojika, and he gave them
his three daughters in marriage, and bestowed on them all his wealth,
and having no other children, went to the Ganges to perform
austerities. And while they were living there in the house of their
father-in-law, a terrible famine arose produced by drought, thereupon
the three Br&aacute;hmans fled, abandoning their virtuous wives, (since
no care for their families touches the hearts of cruel men,) then the
middle one of the three sisters was found to be pregnant; and those
ladies repaired to the house of Yajnadatta a friend of their
father&rsquo;s: there they remained in a miserable condition, thinking
each on her own husband, (for even in calamity women of good family do
not forget the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>duties of virtuous wives). Now in course of time
the middle one of the three sisters gave birth to a son, and they all
three vied with one another in love towards him. So it happened once
upon a time that, as &#346;iva was roaming through the air, the mother
of Skanda<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2067src" href="#xd27e2067" name=
"xd27e2067src">4</a> who was reposing on &#346;iva&rsquo;s breast,
moved with compassion at seeing their love for their child, said to her
husband, &ldquo;My lord, observe, these three women feel great
affection for this boy, and place hope in him, trusting that he may
some day support them; therefore bring it about that he may be able to
maintain them, even in his infancy.&rdquo; Having been thus entreated
by his beloved, &#346;iva, the giver of boons, thus answered her: I
adopt him as my <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, for in a previous birth
he and his wife propitiated me, therefore he has been born on the earth
to reap the fruit of his former austerities; and his former wife has
been born again as <span class="corr" id="xd27e2074" title=
"Source: P&aacute;&#7789;al&aacute;">P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute;</span>
the daughter of the king Mahendravarman, and she shall be his wife in
this birth also. Having said this, that mighty god told those three
virtuous women in a dream,&mdash;&ldquo;This young son of yours shall
be called Putraka; and every day when he awakes from sleep, a hundred
thousand gold pieces shall be found under his pillow,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2077src" href="#xd27e2077" name="xd27e2077src">5</a> and at
last he shall become a king.&rdquo; Accordingly, when he woke up from
sleep, those virtuous daughters of Yajnadatta found the gold and
rejoiced that their vows and prayers had brought forth fruit. Then by
means of that gold Putraka having in a short time accumulated great
treasure, became a king, for good fortune is the result of
austerities.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2091src" href="#xd27e2091"
name="xd27e2091src">6</a> Once upon a time Yajnadatta said in private
to Putraka,&mdash;&ldquo;King, your father and uncles have gone away

"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>There lived formerly in Benares a king
named Brahmadatta. He saw a pair of swans flying in the air at night.
They shone with the lustre of gleaming gold, and were begirt with
hundreds of white swans, and so looked like a sudden flash of
lightning, surrounded by white clouds. And his desire to behold them
again kept increasing so mightily that he took no pleasure in the
delights of royalty. And then having taken counsel with his ministers
he caused a fair tank to be made according to a design of his own, and
gave to all living creatures security from injury. In a short time he
perceived that those two swans had settled in that lake, and when they
had become tame he asked them the reason of their golden plumage. And
then those swans addressed the king with an articulate voice. &lsquo;In
a former <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>birth, O king, we were born as crows; and when we
were fighting for the remains of the daily offering<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2108src" href="#xd27e2108" name="xd27e2108src">8</a> in a holy
empty temple of &#346;iva, we fell down and died within a sacred vessel
belonging to that sanctuary, and consequently we have been born as
golden swans with a remembrance of our former
birth&rsquo;;&mdash;having heard this the king gazed on them to his
heart&rsquo;s content, and derived great pleasure from watching
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore you will gain back your father and uncles by an
unparalleled gift.&rdquo; When Yajnadatta had given him this advice,
Putraka did as he recommended; when they heard the tidings of the
distribution those Br&aacute;hmans arrived: and when they were
recognized they had great wealth bestowed on them, and were reunited to
their wives. Strange to say, even after they have gone through
calamities, wicked men having their minds blinded by want of
discernment, are unable to put off their evil nature. After a time they
hankered after royal power, and being desirous of murdering Putraka
they enticed him under pretext of a pilgrimage to the temple of
Durg&aacute;: and having stationed assassins in the inner sanctuary of
the temple, they said to him, &ldquo;First go and visit the goddess
alone, step inside.&rdquo; Thereupon he entered boldly, but when he saw
those assassins preparing to slay him, he asked them why they wished to
kill him. They replied, &ldquo;We were hired for gold to do it by your
father and uncles.&rdquo; Then the discreet Putraka said to the
assassins, whose senses were bewildered by the goddess, &ldquo;I will
give you this priceless jewelled ornament of mine. Spare me, I will not
reveal your secret; I will go to a distant land.&rdquo; The assassins
said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and taking the ornament they departed,
and falsely informed the father and uncles of Putraka that he was
slain. Then those Br&aacute;hmans returned and endeavoured to get
possession of the throne, but they were put to death by the ministers
as traitors. How can the ungrateful prosper?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that king Putraka, faithful to his promise, entered
the impassable wilds of the Vindhya, disgusted with his relations: as
he wandered about he saw two heroes engaged heart and soul in a
wrestling-match, and he asked them who they were. They replied,
&ldquo;We are the two sons of the Asura Maya, and his wealth belongs to
us, this vessel, and this stick, and these shoes; it is for these that
we are fighting, and whichever of us proves the mightier is to take
them.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of theirs, Putraka said with a
smile&mdash;&ldquo;That is a fine inheritance for a man.&rdquo; Then
they said&mdash;&ldquo;By putting on these shoes one gains the power of
flying through the air; whatever is written with this staff turns out
true; and whatever food a man wishes to have in the vessel is found
there immediately.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>When he heard this, Putraka
said&mdash;&ldquo;What is the use of fighting? Make this agreement,
that whoever proves the best man in running shall possess this
wealth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2128src" href="#xd27e2128"
name="xd27e2128src">9</a> Those simpletons
said&mdash;&ldquo;Agreed&rdquo;&mdash;and set off to run, while the
prince put on the shoes and flew up into the air, taking with him the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>staff and the vessel; then he went a great
distance in a short time and saw beneath him a beautiful city named
&Aacute;karshik&aacute; and descended into it from the sky. He
reflected with himself; &ldquo;<i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> are prone to
deceive, Br&aacute;hmans are like my father and uncles, and merchants
are greedy of wealth; in whose house shall I dwell?&rdquo; Just at that
moment he reached a lonely dilapidated house, and saw a single old
woman in it; so he gratified that old woman with a present, and lived
unobserved in that broken down old house, waited upon respectfully by
the old woman.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the old woman in an affectionate mood said to
Putraka&mdash;&ldquo;I am grieved, my son, that you have not a wife
meet for you. But here there is a maiden named
P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute;, the daughter of the king, and she is
preserved like a jewel in the upper story of a seraglio.&rdquo; While
he was listening to this speech of hers with open ear, the god of love
found an unguarded point, and entered by that very path into his heart.
He made up his mind that he must see that damsel that very day, and in
the night flew up through the air to where she was, by the help of his
magic shoes. He then entered by a window, which was as high above the
ground as the peak of a mountain, and beheld that
P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute;, asleep in a secret place in the seraglio,
continually bathed in the moonlight that seemed to cling to her limbs:
as it were the might of love in fleshly form reposing after the
conquest of this world. While he was thinking how he should awake her,
suddenly outside a watchman began to chant: &ldquo;Young men obtain the
fruit of their birth, when they awake the sleeping fair one, embracing
her as she sweetly scolds, with her eyes languidly opening.&rdquo; On
hearing this encouraging prelude, he embraced that fair one with limbs
trembling with excitement, and then she awoke. When she beheld that
prince, there was a contest between shame and love in her eye, which
was alternately fixed on his face and averted. When they had conversed
together, and gone through the ceremony of the G&aacute;ndharva
marriage, that couple found their love continually increasing, as the
night waned away. Then Putraka took leave of his sorrowing wife, and
with his mind dwelling only on her went in the last watch of the night
to the old woman&rsquo;s house. So every night the prince kept going
backwards and forwards, and at last the intrigue was discovered by the
guards of the seraglio, accordingly they revealed the matter to the
lady&rsquo;s father, and he appointed a woman to watch secretly in the
seraglio at night. She, finding the prince asleep, made a mark with red
lac upon his garment to facilitate his recognition. In the morning she
informed the king of what she had done, and he sent out spies in all
directions, and Putraka was discovered by the mark and dragged out from
the dilapidated house into the presence of the king. Seeing that the
king was enraged, he flew up into the air with the help of the shoes,
and entered the palace of P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute;. He said to
her,&mdash;&ldquo;We are discovered, therefore rise <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>up, let
us escape with the help of the shoes, and so taking
P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute; in his arms he flew away from that place
through the air.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2221src" href="#xd27e2221"
name="xd27e2221src">10</a> Then descending from heaven near the bank of
the Ganges, he refreshed his weary beloved with cakes provided by means
of the magic vessel. When P&aacute;&#7789;al&iacute; saw the power of
Putraka she made a request to him, in accordance with which he sketched
out with the staff a city furnished with a force of all four
arms.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2227src" href="#xd27e2227" name=
"xd27e2227src">11</a> In that city he established himself as king, and
his great power having attained full development, he subdued that
father-in-law of his, and became ruler of the sea-engirdled earth. This
is that same divine city, produced by magic, together with its
citizens; hence it bears the name of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and is
the home of wealth and learning.</p>
<p>When we heard from the mouth of Varsha the above strange and
extraordinarily marvellous story, our minds, O
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, were for a long time delighted with
thrilling wonder.</p>

similar incident is found in Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales translated by
Mrs. Paull, p. 370. The hero of the tale called the Crystal Ball finds
two giants fighting for a little hat. On his expressing his wonder,
&ldquo;Ah&rdquo;, they replied, &ldquo;you call it old, you do not know
its value. It is what is called a wishing-hat, and whoever puts it on
can wish himself where he will, and immediately he is there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Give me the hat,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;I will go
on a little way and when I call you must both run a race to overtake
me, and whoever reaches me first, to him the hat shall belong.&rdquo;
The giants agreed and the youth taking the hat put it on and went away;
but he was thinking so much of the princess that he forgot the giants
and the hat, and continued to go further and further without calling
them. Presently he sighed deeply and said, &ldquo;Ah, if I were only at
the Castle of the golden sun.&rdquo;</p>

the cap of Fortunatus. The inexhaustible purse, although not mentioned

<p class="first">Having related this episode to
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti in the Vindhya forest, Vararuchi again
resumed the main thread of his narrative.</p>
<p>While thus dwelling there with Vy&aacute;&#7693;i and Indradatta, I
gradually attained perfection in all sciences, and emerged from the
condition of childhood. Once on a time when we went out to witness the
festival of Indra, we saw a maiden looking like some weapon of Cupid,
not of the nature of an arrow. Then, Indradatta, on my asking him who
that lady might be, replied,&mdash;&ldquo;She is the daughter of
Upavarsha, and her name is Upako&#347;&aacute;,&rdquo; and she found
out by means of her handmaids who I was, and drawing my soul after her
with a glance made tender by love, she with difficulty managed to
return to her own house. She had a face like a full moon, and eyes like
a blue lotus, she had arms graceful like the stalk of a lotus, and a
lovely full<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2241src" href="#xd27e2241" name=
"xd27e2241src">1</a> bosom; she had a neck marked with three lines like
a shell,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2253src" href="#xd27e2253" name=
"xd27e2253src">2</a> and magnificent coral lips; in short she was a
second Lakshm&iacute;, so to speak, the store-house of the beauty of
king Cupid. Then my heart was cleft by the stroke of love&rsquo;s
arrow, and I could not sleep that night through my desire to kiss her
<i>bimba</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e2260src" href="#xd27e2260"
name="xd27e2260src">3</a> lip. Having at last with difficulty gone off
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>sleep, I saw, at the close of night, a celestial
woman in white garments; she said to
me&mdash;&ldquo;Upako&#347;&aacute; was thy wife in a former birth; as
she appreciates merit, she desires no one but thee, therefore, my son,
thou oughtest not to feel anxious about this matter. I am
Sarasvat&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2268src" href="#xd27e2268"
name="xd27e2268src">4</a> that dwell continually in thy frame, I cannot
bear to behold thy grief.&rdquo; When she had said this, she
disappeared. Then I woke up and somewhat encouraged I went slowly and
stood under a young mango tree near the house of my beloved; then her
confidante came and told me of the ardent attachment of
Upako&#347;&aacute; to me, the result of sudden passion: then I with my
pain doubled, said to her, &ldquo;How can I obtain Upako&#347;&aacute;,
unless her natural protectors willingly bestow her upon me? For death
is better than dishonour; so if by any means your friend&rsquo;s heart
became known to her parents, perhaps the end might be prosperous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore bring this about, my good woman, save the life of
me and of thy friend.&rdquo; When she heard this, she went and told all
to her friend&rsquo;s mother, she immediately told it to her husband
Upavarsha, he to Varsha his brother, and Varsha approved of the match.
Then, my marriage having been determined upon, Vy&aacute;&#7693;i by
the order of my tutor went and brought my mother from
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;; so Upako&#347;&aacute; was bestowed upon
me by her father with all due ceremonies, and I lived happily in
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra with my mother and my wife.</p>
<p>Now in course of time Varsha got a great number of pupils, and among
them there was one rather stupid pupil of the name of
P&aacute;&#7751;ini; he, being wearied out with service, was sent away
by the preceptor&rsquo;s wife, and being disgusted at it and longing
for learning, he went to the Him&aacute;laya to perform austerities:
then he obtained from the god, who wears the moon as a crest,
propitiated by his severe austerities, a new grammar, the source of all
learning. Thereupon he came and challenged me to a disputation, and
seven days passed away in the course of our disputation; on the eighth
day he had been fairly conquered by me, but immediately afterwards a
terrible menacing sound was uttered by &#346;iva in the firmament;
owing to that our Aindra grammar was exploded in the world,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2275src" href="#xd27e2275" name="xd27e2275src">5</a>
and all of us, being conquered by P&aacute;&#7751;ini, became accounted
fools. Accordingly full of despondency I deposited in the hand of the
merchant Hira&#7751;yadatta my wealth for the maintenance of my house,
and after informing Upako&#347;&aacute; of it, I went fasting to mount
Him&aacute;laya to propitiate &#346;iva with austerities.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Upako&#347;&aacute; on her part anxious for my
success, remained in her own house, bathing every day in the Ganges,
strictly observing her vow. One <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>day, when spring had come, she
being still beautiful, though thin and slightly pale, and charming to
the eyes of men, like the streak of the new moon, was seen by the
king&rsquo;s domestic chaplain while going to bathe in the Ganges, and
also by the head magistrate, and by the prince&rsquo;s minister; and
immediately they all of them became a target for the arrows of love. It
happened too somehow or other that she took a long time bathing that
day, and as she was returning in the evening, the prince&rsquo;s
minister laid violent hands on her, but she with great presence of mind
said to him, &ldquo;Dear Sir, I desire this as much as you, but I am of
respectable family, and my husband is away from home. How can I act
thus? Some one might perhaps see us, and then misfortune would befall
you as well as me. Therefore you must come without fail to my house in
the first watch of the night of the spring-festival when the citizens
are all excited.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2285src" href=
"#xd27e2285" name="xd27e2285src">6</a> When she had said this, and
pledged herself, he let her go, but, as chance would have it, she had
not gone many steps further, before she was stopped by the king&rsquo;s
domestic chaplain. She made a similar assignation with him also for the
second watch of the same night; and so he too was, though with
difficulty, induced to let her go; but, after she had gone a little
further, up comes a third person, the head magistrate, and detains the
trembling lady. Then she made a similar assignation with him too for
the third watch of the same night, and having by great good fortune got
him to release her, she went home all trembling, and of her own accord
told her handmaids the arrangements she had made, reflecting,
&ldquo;Death is better for a woman of good family when her husband is
away, than to meet the eyes of people who lust after beauty.&rdquo;
Full of these thoughts and regretting me, the virtuous lady spent that
night in fasting, lamenting her own beauty. Early the next morning she
sent a maid-servant to the merchant Hira&#7751;yagupta to ask for some
money in order that she might honour the Br&aacute;hmans: then that
merchant also came and said to her in private, &ldquo;Shew me love, and
then I will give you what your husband deposited.&rdquo; When she heard
that, she reflected that she had no witness to prove the deposit of her
husband&rsquo;s wealth, and perceived that the merchant was a villain,
and so tortured with sorrow and grief, she made a fourth and last
assignation with him for the last watch of the same night; so he went
away. In the meanwhile she had prepared by her handmaids in a large vat
lamp-black mixed with oil and scented with musk and other perfumes, and
she made ready four pieces of rag anointed with it, and she caused to
be made a large trunk with a fastening outside. So on that day of the
spring-festival the prince&rsquo;s minister came in the first watch of
the night in gorgeous array. When he had entered without being observed
Upako&#347;&aacute; said to him, &ldquo;I will not receive you until
you have bathed, so go in and bathe.&rdquo; The simpleton agreed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>that, and was taken by the handmaids into a secret
dark inner apartment. There they took off his under-garments and his
jewels, and gave him by way of an under-garment a single piece of rag,
and they smeared the rascal from head to foot with a thick coating of
that lamp-black and oil, pretending it was an unguent, without his
detecting it. While they continued rubbing it into every limb, the
second watch of the night came and the chaplain arrived, the handmaids
thereupon said to the minister,&mdash;&ldquo;here is the king&rsquo;s
chaplain come, a great friend of Vararuchi&rsquo;s, so creep into this
box&rdquo;&mdash;and they bundled him into the trunk, just as he was,
all naked, with the utmost precipitation: and then they fastened it
outside with a bolt. The priest too was brought inside into the dark
room on the pretence of a bath, and was in the same way stripped of his
garments and ornaments, and made a fool of by the handmaids by being
rubbed with lamp-black and oil, with nothing but the piece of rag on
him, until in the third watch the chief magistrate arrived. The
handmaids immediately terrified the priest with the news of his
arrival, and pushed him into the trunk like his predecessor. After they
had bolted him in, they brought in the magistrate on the pretext of
giving him a bath, and so he, like his fellows, with the piece of rag
for his only garment, was bamboozled by being continually anointed with
lamp-black, until in the last watch of the night the merchant arrived.
The handmaids made use of his arrival to alarm the magistrate and
bundled him also into the trunk, and fastened it on the outside. So
those three being shut up inside the box, as if they were bent on
accustoming themselves to live in the hell of blind darkness, did not
dare to speak on account of fear, though they touched one another. Then
Upako&#347;&aacute; brought a lamp into the room, and making the
merchant enter it, said to him, &ldquo;give me that money which my
husband deposited with you.&rdquo; When he heard that, the rascal said,
observing that the room was empty, &ldquo;I told you that I would give
you the money your husband deposited with me.&rdquo;
Upako&#347;&aacute; calling the attention of the people in the trunk,
said&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, O ye gods this speech of
Hira&#7751;yagupta.&rdquo; When she had said this, she blew out the
light, and the merchant, like the others, on the pretext of a bath was
anointed by the handmaids for a long time with lamp-black. Then they
told him to go, for the darkness was over, and at the close of the
night they took him by the neck and pushed him out of the door sorely
against his will. Then he made the best of his way home, with only the
piece of rag to cover his nakedness, and smeared with the black dye,
with the dogs biting him at every step, thoroughly ashamed of himself,
and at last reached his own house; and when he got there he did not
dare to look his slaves in the face while they were washing off that
black dye. The path of vice is indeed a painful one. In the early
morning Upako&#347;&aacute; accompanied by her handmaids went, without
informing her parents, to the palace of king <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>Nanda,
and there she herself stated to the king that the merchant
Hira&#7751;yagupta was endeavouring to deprive her of money deposited
with him by her husband. The king in order to enquire into the matter
immediately had the merchant summoned, who said&mdash;&ldquo;I have
nothing in my keeping belonging to this lady.&rdquo;
Upako&#347;&aacute; then said, &ldquo;I have witnesses, my lord; before
he went, my husband put the household gods into a box, and this
merchant with his own lips admitted the deposit in their presence. Let
the box be brought here and ask the gods yourself.&rdquo; Having heard
this the king in astonishment ordered the box to be brought.</p>
<p>Thereupon in a moment that trunk was carried in by many men. Then
Upako&#347;&aacute; said&mdash;&ldquo;Relate truly, O gods, what that
merchant said and then go to your own houses; if you do not, I will
burn you or open the box in court.&rdquo; Hearing that, the men in the
box, beside themselves with fear, said&mdash;&ldquo;It is true, the
merchant admitted the deposit in our presence.&rdquo; Then the merchant
being utterly confounded confessed all his guilt; but the king, being
unable to restrain his curiosity, after asking permission of
Upako&#347;&aacute;, opened the chest there in court by breaking the
fastening, and those three men were dragged out, looking like three
lumps of solid darkness, and were with difficulty recognised by the
king and his ministers. The whole assembly then burst out laughing, and
the king in his curiosity asked Upako&#347;&aacute;, what was the
meaning of all this; so the virtuous lady told the whole story. All
present in court expressed their approbation of
Upako&#347;&aacute;&rsquo;s conduct, observing: &ldquo;The virtuous
behaviour of women of good family who are protected by their own
excellent disposition<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2294src" href=
"#xd27e2294" name="xd27e2294src">7</a> only, is incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all those coveters of their neighbour&rsquo;s wife were
deprived of all their living, and banished from the country. Who
prospers by immorality? Upako&#347;&aacute; was dismissed by the king,
who shewed his great regard for her by a present of much wealth, and
said to her: &ldquo;Henceforth thou art my sister,&rdquo;&mdash;and so
she returned home. Varsha and Upavarsha when they heard it,
congratulated that chaste lady, and there was a smile of admiration on
the face of every single person in that city.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2299src" href="#xd27e2299" name="xd27e2299src">8</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile, by performing a very severe penance on the snowy
mountain, I propitiated the god, the husband of P&aacute;rvat&iacute;,
the great giver of all good things; he revealed to me that same
treatise of P&aacute;&#7751;ini; and in accordance with his wish I
completed it: then I returned home without feeling the fatigue of the
journey, full of the nectar of the favour of that god who wears on his
crest a digit of the moon; then I worshipped the feet of my mother and
of my spiritual teachers, and heard from them the wonderful achievement
of Upako&#347;&aacute;, thereupon joy and astonishment swelled to the
upmost height in my breast, together with natural affection and great
respect for my wife.</p>
<p>Now Varsha expressed a desire to hear from my lips the new grammar,
and thereupon the god K&aacute;rtikeya himself revealed it to him. And
it came to pass that Vy&aacute;&#7693;i and Indradatta asked their
preceptor Varsha what fee they should give him? He replied, &ldquo;Give
me ten millions of gold pieces.&rdquo; So they, consenting to the
preceptor&rsquo;s demand, said to me; &ldquo;Come with us, friend, to
ask the king Nanda to give us the sum required for our teacher&rsquo;s
fee; we cannot obtain so much gold from any other quarter: for he
possesses nine hundred and ninety millions, and long ago he declared
your wife Upako&#347;&aacute;, his sister in the faith, therefore you
are his brother-in-law; we shall obtain something for the sake of your
virtues.&rdquo; Having formed this resolution, we three
fellow-students<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2344src" href="#xd27e2344"
name="xd27e2344src">9</a> went to the camp of king Nanda in
Ayodhy&aacute;, and the very moment we arrived, the king died;
accordingly an outburst of lamentation arose in the kingdom, and we
were reduced to despair. Immediately Indradatta, who was an adept in
magic, said, &ldquo;I will enter the body of this dead king<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2350src" href="#xd27e2350" name=
"xd27e2350src">10</a>; let Vararuchi prefer the petition to me, and I
will give him the gold, and let Vy&aacute;&#7693;i guard my body until
I return.&rdquo; Saying this, Indradatta entered into the body of king
Nanda, and when the king came to life again, there was great rejoicing
in the kingdom. While Vy&aacute;&#7693;i remained in an empty temple to
guard the body of Indradatta, I went to the king&rsquo;s palace. I
entered, and after making the usual salutation, I asked the supposed
Nanda for ten million gold pieces as my instructor&rsquo;s fee. Then he
ordered a man named &#346;akat&aacute;la, the minister of the real
Nanda, to give me ten million of gold pieces. That minister, when he
saw that the dead king had come to life, and that the petitioner
immediately got what he asked, guessed the real state of the case. What
is there that the wise cannot understand? That minister
said&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be given, your Highness,&rdquo; and
reflected with himself; &ldquo;Nanda&rsquo;s son is but a child, and
our realm is menaced by many enemies, so I will do my best for the
present to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>keep his body on the throne even in its present
state.&rdquo; Having resolved on this, he immediately took steps to
have all dead bodies burnt, employing spies to discover them, and among
them was found the body of Indradatta, which was burned after
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i had been hustled out of the temple. In the meanwhile
the king was pressing for the payment of the money, but
&#346;akat&aacute;la, who was still in doubt, said to him, &ldquo;All
the servants have got their heads turned by the public rejoicing, let
the Br&aacute;hman wait a moment until I can give it.&rdquo; Then
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i came and complained aloud in the presence of the
supposed Nanda, &ldquo;Help, help, a Br&aacute;hman engaged in magic,
whose life had not yet come to an end in a natural way, has been burnt
by force on the pretext that his body was untenanted, and this in the
very moment of your good fortune.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2355src" href="#xd27e2355" name="xd27e2355src">11</a> On hearing
this the supposed Nanda was in an indescribable state of distraction
from grief: but as soon as Indradatta was imprisoned in the body of
Nanda, beyond the possibility of escape, by the burning of his body,
the discreet &#346;akat&aacute;la went out and gave me that ten
millions.</p>
<p>Then the supposed Nanda,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2368src" href=
"#xd27e2368" name="xd27e2368src">12</a> full of grief, said in secret
to Vy&aacute;&#7693;i,&mdash;&ldquo;Though a Br&aacute;hman by birth I
have become a &#346;&uacute;dra, what is the use of my royal fortune to
me though it be firmly established?&rdquo; When he heard that,
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i comforted him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2377src"
href="#xd27e2377" name="xd27e2377src">13</a> and gave him seasonable
advice, &ldquo;You have been discovered by &#346;akat&aacute;la, so you
must henceforth be on your guard against him, for he is a great
minister, and in a short time he will, when it suits his purpose,
destroy you, and will make Chandragupta, the son of the previous Nanda,
king. Therefore immediately appoint Vararuchi your minister, in order
that your rule may be firmly established by the help of his intellect,
which is of god-like acuteness.&rdquo; When he had said this,
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i departed to give that fee to his preceptor, and
immediately Yogananda sent for me and made me his minister. Then I said
to the king, &ldquo;Though your caste as a Br&aacute;hman has been
taken from you, I do not consider your throne secure as long as
&#346;akat&aacute;la remains in office, therefore destroy him by some
stratagem.&rdquo; When I had given him this advice, Yogananda threw
&#346;akat&aacute;la into a dark dungeon, and his hundred sons with
him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2383src" href="#xd27e2383" name=
"xd27e2383src">14</a> proclaiming as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>his crime that he had
burnt a Br&aacute;hman alive. One porringer of barley-meal and one of
water was placed inside the dungeon every day for &#346;akat&aacute;la
and his sons, and thereupon he said to them;&mdash;&ldquo;My sons, even
one man alone would with difficulty subsist on this barley-meal, much
less can a number of people do so. Therefore let that one of us, who is
able to take vengeance on Yogananda, consume every day the barley-meal
and the water.&rdquo; His sons answered him, &ldquo;You alone are able
to punish him, therefore do you consume them.&rdquo; For vengeance is
dearer to the resolute than life itself. So &#346;akat&aacute;la alone
subsisted on that meal and water every day. Alas! those whose souls are
set on victory are cruel. &#346;akat&aacute;la in the dark dungeon,
beholding the death agonies of his starving sons, thought to himself,
&ldquo;A man who desires his own welfare should not act in an arbitrary
manner towards the powerful, without fathoming their character and
acquiring their confidence.&rdquo; Accordingly his hundred sons
perished before his eyes, and he alone remained alive surrounded by
their skeletons. Then Yogananda took firm root in his kingdom. And
Vy&aacute;&#7693;i approached him after giving the present to his
teacher, and after coming near to him said, &ldquo;May thy rule, my
friend, last long! I take my leave of thee, I go to perform austerities
somewhere.&rdquo; Hearing that, Yogananda, with his voice choked with
tears, said to him, &ldquo;Stop thou, and enjoy pleasures in my
kingdom, do not go and desert me.&rdquo; Vy&aacute;&#7693;i
answered&mdash;&ldquo;King! Life comes to an end in a moment. What wise
man, I pray you, drowns himself in these hollow and fleeting
enjoyments? Prosperity, a desert mirage, does not turn the head of the
wise man.&rdquo; Saying this he went away that moment resolved to
mortify his flesh with austerities. Then that Yogananda went to his
metropolis P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, for the purpose of enjoyment,
accompanied by me, and surrounded with his whole army. So I, having
attained prosperity, lived for a long time in that state, waited upon
by Upako&#347;&aacute;, and bearing the burden of the office of
prime-minister to that king, accompanied by my mother and my
preceptors. There the Ganges, propitiated by my austerities, gave me
every day much wealth, and Sarasvat&iacute; present in bodily form told
me continually what measures to adopt.</p>

<p class="first">Having said this, Vararuchi continued his tale as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>In course of time Yogananda became enslaved by his passions, and
like a mad elephant he disregarded every restraint. Whom will not a
sudden access of prosperity intoxicate? Then I reflected with myself,
&ldquo;The king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>has burst all bonds, and my own religious duties
are neglected being interfered with by my care for his affairs,
therefore it is better for me to draw out that &#346;akat&aacute;la
from his dungeon and make him my colleague in the ministry; even if he
tries to oppose me, what harm can he do as long as I am in
office?&rdquo; Having resolved on this I asked permission of the king,
and drew &#346;akat&aacute;la out of the deep dungeon. Br&aacute;hmans
are always soft-hearted. Now the discreet &#346;akat&aacute;la made up
his mind, that it would be difficult to overthrow Yogananda as long as
I was in office, and that he had accordingly better imitate the cane
which bends with the current, and watch a favourable moment for
vengeance, so at my request he resumed the office of minister and
managed the king&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
<p>Once on a time Yogananda went outside the city, and beheld in the
middle of the Ganges a hand, the five fingers of which were closely
pressed together. That moment he summoned me and said, &ldquo;What does
this mean?&rdquo; But I displayed two of my fingers in the direction of
the hand. Thereupon that hand disappeared, and the king, exceedingly
astonished, again asked me what this meant, and I answered him,
&ldquo;That hand meant to say, by shewing its five fingers, &lsquo;What
cannot five men united effect in this world?&rsquo; Then I, king,
shewed it these two fingers, wishing to indicate that nothing is
impossible when even two men are of one mind.&rdquo; When I uttered
this solution of the riddle the king was delighted, and
&#346;akat&aacute;la was despondent seeing that my intellect would be
difficult to circumvent.</p>
<p>One day Yogananda saw his queen leaning out of the window and asking
questions of a Br&aacute;hman guest that was looking up. That trivial
circumstance threw the king into a passion, and he gave orders that the
Br&aacute;hman should be put to death; for jealousy interferes with
discernment. Then as that Br&aacute;hman was being led off to the place
of execution in order that he might be put to death, a fish in the
market laughed aloud, though it was dead.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2401src" href="#xd27e2401" name="xd27e2401src">1</a> The king
hearing it immediately prohibited for the present the execution of that
Br&aacute;hman, and asked me the reason why the fish laughed. I replied
that I would tell him after I had thought over the matter; and after I
had gone out Sarasvat&iacute; came to me secretly on my thinking of her
and gave me this advice; &ldquo;Take up a position on the top
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>of this palm tree at night so as not to be
observed, and thou shalt without doubt hear the reason why the fish
laughed.&rdquo; Hearing this I went at night to that very place, and
ensconced myself on the top of the palm tree, and saw a terrible female
R&aacute;kshasa coming past with her children; when they asked her for
food, she said, &ldquo;Wait, and I will give you to-morrow morning the
flesh of a Br&aacute;hman, he was not killed to-day.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2409src" href="#xd27e2409" name="xd27e2409src">2</a>
They said to their mother, &ldquo;Why was he not killed to-day?&rdquo;
Then she replied, &ldquo;He was not executed because a fish in the
town, though dead, laughed when it saw him.&rdquo; The sons said,
&ldquo;Why did the fish laugh?&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;The fish of
course said to himself&mdash;all the king&rsquo;s wives are dissolute,
for in every part of this harem there are men dressed up as women, and
nevertheless while these escape, an innocent Br&aacute;hman is to be
put to death&mdash;and this tickled the fish so that he laughed. For
demons assume these disguises, insinuating themselves into everything,
and laughing at the exceeding want of discernment of kings.&rdquo;
After I had heard that speech of the female R&aacute;kshasa I went away
from thence, and in the morning I informed the king why the fish
laughed. The king after detecting in the harem those men clothed as
women, looked upon me with great respect, and released that
Br&aacute;hman from the sentence of death.</p>
<p>I was disgusted by seeing this and other lawless proceedings on the
part of the king, and, while I was in this frame of mind, there came to
court a new painter. He painted on a sheet of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e2416" title="Source: canvass">canvas</span> the principal queen
and Yogananda, and that picture of his looked as if it were alive, it
only lacked speech and motion. And the king being delighted loaded that
painter with wealth, and had the painting set up on a wall in his
private apartments. Now one day when I entered into the king&rsquo;s
private apartments, it occurred to me that the painting of the queen
did not represent all her auspicious marks; from the arrangement of the
other marks I conjectured by means of my acuteness that there ought to
be a spot where the girdle comes, and I painted one there. Then I
departed after thus giving the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>queen all her lucky marks. Then
Yogananda entered and saw that spot, and asked his chamberlains who had
painted it. And they indicated me to him as the person who had painted
it. Yogananda thus reflected while burning with anger; &ldquo;No one
except myself knows of that spot, which is in a part of the
queen&rsquo;s body usually concealed, then how can this Vararuchi have
come thus to know it?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2421src" href=
"#xd27e2421" name="xd27e2421src">3</a> No doubt he has secretly
corrupted my harem, and this is how he came to see there those men
disguised as women.&rdquo; Foolish men often find such coincidences.
Then of his own motion he summoned &#346;akat&aacute;la, and gave him
the following order: &ldquo;You must put Vararuchi to death for
seducing the queen.&rdquo; &#346;akat&aacute;la said, &ldquo;Your
Majesty&rsquo;s orders shall be executed,&rdquo; and went out of the
palace, reflecting, &ldquo;I should not have power to put Vararuchi to
death, for he possesses godlike force of intellect; and he delivered me
from calamity; moreover he is a Br&aacute;hman, therefore I had better
hide him and win him over to my side.&rdquo; Having formed this
resolution, he came and told me of the king&rsquo;s causeless wrath
which had ended in his ordering my execution, and thus concluded,
&ldquo;I will have some one else put to death in order that the news
may get abroad, and do you remain hidden in my house to protect me from
this passionate king.&rdquo; In accordance with this proposal of his, I
remained concealed in his house, and he had some one else put to death
at night in order that the report of my death might be spread.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2424src" href="#xd27e2424" name="xd27e2424src">4</a>
When he had in this way displayed his statecraft, I said to him out of
affection, &ldquo;You have shewn yourself an unrivalled minister in
that you did not attempt to put me to death; for I cannot be slain,
since I have a R&aacute;kshasa to friend, and he will come, on being
only thought of, and at my request will devour the whole world. As for
this king he is a friend of mine, being a Br&aacute;hman named
Indradatta, and he ought not to be slain.&rdquo; Hearing this, that
minister said&mdash;&ldquo;Shew me the R&aacute;kshasa.&rdquo; Then I
shewed him that R&aacute;kshasa who came with a thought; and on
beholding him, &#346;akat&aacute;la was astonished and terrified. And
when the R&aacute;kshasa had disappeared, &#346;akat&aacute;la again
asked me&mdash;&ldquo;How did the R&aacute;kshasa become your
friend?&rdquo; Then I said&mdash;&ldquo;Long ago the heads of the
police as they went through the city night after night on inspecting
duty, perished one by one. On hearing that, Yogananda made me head of
the police, and as I was on my rounds at night, I saw a R&aacute;kshasa
roaming about, and he said to me, &ldquo;Tell me, who is considered the
best-looking woman in this city?&rdquo; When I heard that, I burst out
laughing and said&mdash;&ldquo;You fool, any woman is good-looking to
the man who admires her.&rdquo; Hearing my answer, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;You are the only man that has beaten me.&rdquo; And
now that I had escaped death by solving his riddle,<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=

henceforth you are my friend, and I will appear to you when you call me
to mind.&rdquo; Thus he spoke and disappeared, and I returned by the
way that I came. Thus the R&aacute;kshasa has become my friend, and my
ally in trouble. When I had said this, &#346;akat&aacute;la made a
second request to me, and I shewed him the goddess of the Ganges in
human form who came when I thought of her. And that goddess disappeared
when she had been gratified by me with hymns of praise. But
&#346;akat&aacute;la became from thenceforth my obedient ally.</p>
<p>Now once on a time that minister said to me when my state of
concealment weighed upon my spirits; &ldquo;why do you, although you
know all things, abandon yourself to despondency? Do you not know that
the minds of kings are most undiscerning, and in a short time you will
be cleared from all imputations;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2444src"

<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The story of &#346;ivavarman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There reigned here long ago a king named
&Aacute;dityavarman, and he had a very wise minister, named
&#346;ivavarman. Now it came to pass that one of that king&rsquo;s
queens became pregnant, and when he found it out, the king said to the
guards of the harem, &ldquo;It is now two years since I entered this
place, then how has this queen become pregnant? Tell me.&rdquo; Then
they said, &ldquo;No man except your minister &#346;ivavarman is
allowed to enter here, but he enters without any restriction.&rdquo;
When he heard that, the king thought,&mdash;&ldquo;Surely he is guilty
of treason against me, and yet if I put him to death publicly, I shall
incur reproach,&rdquo;&mdash;thus reflecting, that king sent that
&#346;ivavarman on some pretext to Bhogavarman a neighbouring
chief,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2458src" href="#xd27e2458" name=
"xd27e2458src">7</a> who was an ally of his, and immediately afterwards
the king secretly sent off a messenger to the same chief, bearing a
letter by which he was ordered to put the minister to death. When a
week had elapsed after the minister&rsquo;s departure, that queen tried
to escape out of fear, and was taken by the guards with a man in
woman&rsquo;s attire, then &Aacute;dityavarman when he heard of it was
filled with remorse, and asked himself why he had causelessly brought
about the death of so excellent a minister. In the meanwhile
&#346;ivavarman reached the Court of Bhogavarman, and that messenger
came bringing the letter; and fate would have it so that after
Bhogavarman had read the letter he told to &#346;ivavarman in secret
the order he had received to put him to death.</p>
<p>The excellent minister &#346;ivavarman in his turn said to that
chief,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>&ldquo;put me to death; if you do not, I will slay
myself with my own hand.&rdquo; When he heard that, Bhogavarman was
filled with wonder, and said to him, &ldquo;What does all this mean?
Tell me Br&aacute;hman, if you do not, you will lie under my
curse.&rdquo; Then the minister said to him, &ldquo;King, in whatever
land I am slain, on that land God will not send rain for twelve
years.&rdquo; When he heard that, Bhogavarman debated with his
minister,&mdash;&ldquo;that wicked king desires the destruction of our
land, for could he not have employed secret assassins to kill his
minister? So we must not put this minister to death, moreover we must
prevent him from laying violent hands on himself.&rdquo; Having thus
deliberated and appointed him guards, Bhogavarman sent &#346;ivavarman
out of his country that moment; so that minister by means of his wisdom
returned alive, and his innocence was established from another quarter,
for righteousness cannot be undone.</p>
<p>In the same way your innocence will be made clear,
K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana; remain for a while in my house; this king too
will repent of what he has done. When &#346;akat&aacute;la said this to
me, I spent those days concealed in his house, waiting my
opportunity.</p>
<p>Then it came to pass that one day, O K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti,
a son of that Yogananda named Hira&#7751;yagupta went out hunting, and
when he had somehow or other been carried to a great distance by the
speed of his horse, while he was alone in the wood the day came to an
end; and then he ascended a tree to pass the night. Immediately
afterwards a bear, which had been terrified by a lion, ascended the
same tree; he seeing the prince frightened, said to him with a human
voice, &ldquo;Fear not, thou art my friend,&rdquo; and thus promised
him immunity from harm. Then the prince confiding in the bear&rsquo;s
promise went to sleep, while the bear remained awake. Then the lion
below said to the bear, &ldquo;Bear, throw me down this man, and I will
go away.&rdquo; Then the bear said, &ldquo;Villain, I will not cause
the death of a friend.&rdquo; When in course of time the bear went to
sleep while the prince was awake, the lion said again, &ldquo;Man,
throw me down the bear.&rdquo; When he heard that, the prince, who
through fear for his own safety wished to propitiate the lion, tried to
throw down the bear, but wonderful to say, it did not fall, since Fate
caused it to awake. And then that bear said to the prince,
&ldquo;become insane, thou betrayer of thy friend,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2471src" href="#xd27e2471" name="xd27e2471src">8</a>
laying upon him a curse destined not to end until a third person
guessed the whole transaction. Accordingly the prince, when he reached
his palace in the morning went out of his mind, and Yogananda seeing
it, was immediately plunged in despondency; and said, &ldquo;If
Vararuchi were alive at this moment, all this matter would be
known;<a id="xd27e2474" name="xd27e2474"></a> curse on my readiness to
have him put to death!<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29"
href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>&#346;akat&aacute;la, when he
heard this exclamation of the king&rsquo;s, thought to himself,
&ldquo;Ha! here is an opportunity obtained for bringing
K&aacute;ty&aacute;yana out of concealment, and he being a proud man
will not remain here, and the king will repose confidence in me.&rdquo;
After reflecting thus, he implored pardon, and said to the king,
&ldquo;O King, cease from despondency, Vararuchi remains alive.&rdquo;
Then Yogananda said, &ldquo;Let him be brought quickly.&rdquo; Then I
was suddenly brought by &#346;akat&aacute;la into the presence of
Yogananda and beheld the prince in that state; and by the favour of
Sarasvat&iacute; I was enabled to reveal the whole occurrence; and I
said, &ldquo;King, he has proved a traitor to his friend&rdquo;; then I
was praised by that prince who was delivered from his curse; and the
king asked me how I had managed to find out what had taken place. Then
I said, &ldquo;King, the minds of the wise see everything by inference
from signs, and by acuteness of intellect. So I found out all this in
the same way as I found out that mole.&rdquo; When I had said this,
that king was afflicted with shame. Then without accepting his
munificence, considering myself to have gained all I desired by the
clearing of my reputation, I went home: for to the wise character is
wealth. And the moment I arrived, the servants of my house wept before
me, and when I was distressed at it Upavarsha came to me and said,
&ldquo;Upako&#347;&aacute;, when she heard that the king had put you to
death, committed her body to the flames, and then your mother&rsquo;s
heart broke with grief.&rdquo; Hearing that, senseless with the
distraction produced by recently aroused grief, I suddenly fell on the
ground like a tree broken by the wind: and in a moment I tasted the
relief of loud lamentations; whom will not the fire of grief, produced
by the loss of dear relations, scorch? Varsha came and gave me sound
advice in such words as these, &ldquo;The only thing that is stable in
this ever-changeful world is instability, then why are you distracted
though you know this delusion of the Creator&rdquo;? By the help of
these and similar exhortations I at length, though with difficulty,
regained my equanimity; then with heart disgusted with the world, I
flung aside all earthly lords, and choosing self-restraint for my only
companion, I went to a grove where asceticism was practised.</p>
<p>Then, as days went by, once on a time a Br&aacute;hman from
Ayodhy&aacute; came to that ascetic-grove while I was there: I asked
him for tidings about Yogananda&rsquo;s government, and he recognizing
me told me in sorrowful accents the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear what happened to Nanda after you had left him.
&#346;akat&aacute;la after waiting for it a long time, found that he
had now obtained an opportunity of injuring him. While thinking how he
might by some device get Yogananda killed, he happened to see a
Br&aacute;hman named Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya digging up the earth in his
path; he said to him, &ldquo;Why are you digging up the earth?&rdquo;
The Br&aacute;hman, whom he had asked, said, I am rooting up a plant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>of <i>darbha</i> grass here, because it has
pricked my foot.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2490src" href="#xd27e2490"
name="xd27e2490src">9</a> When he heard that, the minister thought that
Br&aacute;hman who formed such stern resolves out of anger, would be
the best instrument to destroy Nanda with. After asking his name he
said to him, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I assign to you the duty of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e2493" title="Source: performing">presiding
at</span> a <i>&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i> on the thirteenth day of the
lunar fortnight, in the house of king Nanda; you shall have one hundred
thousand gold pieces by way of fee, and you shall sit at the board
above all others; in the meanwhile come to my house.&rdquo; Saying
this, &#346;akat&aacute;la took that Br&aacute;hman to his house, and
on the day of the <i>&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i> he showed the
Br&aacute;hman to the king, and he approved of him. Then
Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya went and sat at the head of the table during the
<i>&#347;r&aacute;ddha</i>, but a Br&aacute;hman named Subandhu desired
that post of honour for himself. Then &#346;akat&aacute;la went and
referred the matter to king Nanda, who answered, &ldquo;Let Subandhu
sit at the head of the table, no one else deserves the place.&rdquo;
Then &#346;akat&aacute;la went, and, humbly bowing through fear,
communicated that order of the king&rsquo;s to Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya,
adding, &ldquo;it is not my fault.&rdquo; Then that
Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya, being, as it were, inflamed all over with wrath,
undoing the lock of hair on the crown of his head, made this solemn
vow, &ldquo;Surely this Nanda must be destroyed by me within seven
days, and then my anger being appeased I will bind up my lock.&rdquo;
When he had said this, Yogananda was enraged; so Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya
escaped unobserved, and &#346;akat&aacute;la gave him refuge in his
house. Then being supplied by &#346;akat&aacute;la with the necessary
instruments, that Br&aacute;hman Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya went somewhere
and performed a magic rite; in consequence of this rite Yogananda
caught a burning fever, and died when the seventh day arrived; and
&#346;akat&aacute;la, having slain Nanda&rsquo;s son
Hira&#7751;yagupta, bestowed the royal dignity upon Chandragupta a son
of the previous Nanda. And after he had requested
Ch&aacute;&#7751;akya, equal in ability to B&#7771;ihaspati,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2506src" href="#xd27e2506" name=
"xd27e2506src">10</a> to be Chandragupta&rsquo;s prime-minister, and
established him in the office, that minister, considering that all his
objects had been accomplished, as he had wreaked his vengeance on
Yogananda, despondent through sorrow for the death of his sons, retired
to the forest.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2509src" href=
"#xd27e2509" name="xd27e2509src">11</a></p>
<p>After I had heard this, O K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, from the
mouth of that Br&aacute;hman, I became exceedingly afflicted, seeing
that all things are unstable; and on account of my affliction I came to
visit this shrine of Durg&aacute;, and through her favour having beheld
you, O my friend, I have remembered my former birth. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>And having obtained divine discernment I have told you the great
tale: now as my curse has spent its strength, I will strive to leave
the body; and do you remain here for the present, until there comes to
you a Br&aacute;hman named Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya, who has
forsaken the use of three languages,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2517src" href="#xd27e2517" name="xd27e2517src">12</a> surrounded
with his pupils, for he like myself was cursed by the goddess in anger,
being an excellent Ga&#7751;a M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n by name, who for
taking my part has become a mortal. To him you must tell this tale
originally told by Siva, then you shall be delivered from your curse,
and so shall he.</p>
<p>Having said all this to K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, that
Vararuchi set forth for the holy hermitage of Badarik&aacute; in order
to put off his body. As he was going along he beheld on the banks of
the Ganges a vegetable-eating<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2522src" href=
"#xd27e2522" name="xd27e2522src">13</a> hermit, and while he was
looking on, that hermit&rsquo;s hand was pricked with <i>ku&#347;a</i>
grass. Then Vararuchi turned his blood, as it flowed out, into
sap<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2534src" href="#xd27e2534" name=
"xd27e2534src">14</a> through his magic power, out of curiosity, in
order to test his egotism; on beholding that, the hermit exclaimed,
&ldquo;Ha! I have attained perfection;&rdquo; and so he became puffed
up with pride. Then Vararuchi laughed a little and said to him,
&ldquo;I turned your blood into sap in order to test you, because even
now, O hermit, you have not abandoned egotism. Egotism is in truth an
obstacle in the road to knowledge hard to overcome, and without
knowledge liberation cannot be attained even by a hundred vows. But the
perishable joys of Svarga cannot attract the hearts of those who long
for liberation, therefore, O hermit, endeavour to acquire knowledge by
forsaking egotism.&rdquo; Having thus read that hermit a lesson, and
having been praised by him prostrate in adoration, Vararuchi went to
the tranquil site of the hermitage of Badar&iacute;.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2540src" href="#xd27e2540" name="xd27e2540src">15</a> There
he, desirous of putting off his mortal condition, resorted for
protection with intense devotion to that goddess who only can protect,
and she manifesting her real form to him told him the secret of that
meditation which arises from fire, to help him to put off the body.
Then Vararuchi having consumed his body by that form of meditation,
reached his own heavenly home; and henceforth that
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti remained in the Vindhya forest eager for
his desired meeting with Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya. <span class=

Thorpe&rsquo;s Yuletide Stories, page 341. Just as he was going to
sleep, twelve crows came flying and perched in the elder trees over
Svend&rsquo;s head. They began to converse together, and the one told
the other what had happened to him that day. When they were about to
fly away, one crow said, &ldquo;I am so hungry; where shall I get
something to eat?&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall have food enough to-morrow
when father has killed Svend,&rdquo; answered the crow&rsquo;s brother.
&ldquo;Dost thou think then that such a miserable fellow dares fight
with our father?&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Yes, it is probable enough
that he will, but it will not profit him much as our father cannot be
overcome but with the Man of the Mount&rsquo;s sword, and that hangs in
the mound, within seven locked doors, before each of which are two
fierce dogs that never sleep.&rdquo; Svend thus learned that he should

<p class="first">Then that M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n wandering about in
the wood in human form, passing under the name of
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya, having served the king
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana, and having, in accordance with a vow,
abandoned in his presence the use of Sanskrit and two other languages,
with sorrowful mind came to pay a visit to Durg&aacute;, the dweller in
the Vindhya hills; and by her orders he went and beheld
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti. Then he remembered his origin and
suddenly, as it were, awoke from sleep; and making use of the
Pai&#347;&aacute;cha language, which was different from the three
languages he had sworn to forsake, he said to
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, after telling him his own name;
&ldquo;Quickly tell me that tale which you heard from Pushpadanta, in
order that you and I together, my friend, may escape from our
curse.&rdquo; Hearing that, K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti bowed before
him, and said to him in joyful mood, &ldquo;I will tell you the story,
but great curiosity possesses me, my lord, first tell me all your
adventures from your birth, do me this favour.&rdquo; Thus being
entreated by him, Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya proceeded to relate as
follows:</p>
<p>In Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2555src"
href="#xd27e2555" name="xd27e2555src">1</a> there is a city named
Supratish&#7789;hita; in it there dwelt once upon a time an excellent
Br&aacute;hman named Soma&#347;arman, and he, my friend, had two sons
Vatsa and Gulmaka, and he had also born to him a third child, a
daughter named &#346;rut&aacute;rth&aacute;. Now in course of time,
that Br&aacute;hman and his wife died, and those two sons of his
remained taking care of their sister. And she suddenly became pregnant.
Then Vatsa and Gulma began to suspect one another, because no other man
came in their sister&rsquo;s way: thereupon
&#346;rut&aacute;rth&aacute;, who saw what was in their minds, said to
those brothers,&mdash;&ldquo;Do not entertain evil suspicions, listen,
I will tell you the truth; there is a prince of the name of
K&iacute;rtisena, brother&rsquo;s son to V&aacute;suki, the king of the
N&aacute;gas;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2558src" href="#xd27e2558"
name="xd27e2558src">2</a> he saw me when I was going to bathe,
thereupon he was overcome with love, and after telling me his lineage
and his name, made me his wife by the G&aacute;ndharva marriage; he
belongs to the Br&aacute;hman race, and it is by him that I am
pregnant.&rdquo; When they heard this speech of their sister&rsquo;s,
Vatsa and Gulma said, &ldquo;What confidence can we repose in all
this?&rdquo; Then she silently called to mind that N&aacute;ga prince,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>and immediately he was thought upon, he came and
said to Vatsa and Gulma, &ldquo;In truth I have made your sister my
wife, she is a glorious heavenly nymph fallen down to earth in
consequence of a curse, and you too have descended to earth for the
same reason, but a son shall without fail be born to your sister here,
and then you and she together shall be freed from your curse.&rdquo;
Having said this he disappeared, and in a few days from that time, a
son was born to &#346;rut&aacute;rth&aacute;; know me my friend as that
son.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2566src" href="#xd27e2566" name=
"xd27e2566src">3</a> At that very time a divine voice was heard from
heaven, &ldquo;This child that is born is an incarnation of virtue, and
he shall be called <span class="corr" id="xd27e2575" title=

the Br&aacute;hman caste.<span class="corr" title=

curse had spent its force, died, and I for my part became inconsolable.
Then I flung aside my grief, and though a child I went in the strength
of my self-reliance to the Deccan to acquire knowledge. Then, having in
course of time learned all sciences, and become famous, I returned to
my native land to exhibit my accomplishments; and when I entered after
a long absence into the city of Supratish&#7789;hita, surrounded by my
disciples, I saw a wonderfully splendid scene. In one place chanters
were intoning according to prescribed custom the hymns of the
S&aacute;ma Veda, in another place Br&aacute;hmans were disputing about
the interpretation of the sacred books, in another place gamblers were
praising gambling in these deceitful words, &ldquo;Whoever knows the
art of gambling, has a treasure in his grasp,&rdquo; and in another
place, in the midst of a knot of merchants, who were talking to one
another about their skill in the art of making money, a certain
merchant spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of the Mouse-merchant.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is not very wonderful that a thrifty man should
acquire wealth by wealth; but I long ago achieved prosperity without
any wealth to start with. My father died before I was born, and then my
mother was deprived by wicked relations of all she possessed. Then she
fled through fear of them, watching over the safety of her unborn
child, and dwelt in the house of Kum&aacute;radatta a friend of my
father&rsquo;s, and there the virtuous woman gave birth to me, who was
destined to be the means of her future maintenance; and so she reared
me up by performing menial drudgery. And as she was so poor, she
persuaded a teacher by way of charity to give me some instruction in
writing and ciphering. Then she said to me, &ldquo;You are the son of a
merchant, so you must now engage in trade, and there is a very rich
merchant in this country called Vi&#347;&aacute;khila; he is in the
habit of lending capital to poor men of good family, go and entreat him
to give you something to start with.&rdquo; Then I went to his house,
and he at the very moment I entered, said in a rage to some
merchant&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;you see this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>dead mouse here upon the
floor, even that is a commodity by which a capable man would acquire
wealth, but I gave you, you good-for-nothing fellow, many
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2597src" href=
"#xd27e2597" name="xd27e2597src">5</a> and so far from increasing them,
you have not even been able to preserve what you got.&rdquo; When I
heard that, I suddenly said to that Vi&#347;&aacute;khila, &ldquo;I
hereby take from you that mouse as capital advanced;&rdquo; saying this
I took the mouse up in my hand, and wrote him a receipt for it, which
he put in his strong box, and off I went. The merchant for his part
burst out laughing. Well, I sold that mouse to a certain merchant as
cat&rsquo;s-meat for two handfuls of gram, then I ground up that gram,
and taking a pitcher of water, I went and stood on the cross-road in a
shady place, outside the city; there I offered with the utmost civility
the water and gram to a band of wood-cutters;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2625src" href="#xd27e2625" name="xd27e2625src">6</a> every
wood-cutter gave me as a token of gratitude two pieces of wood; and I
took those pieces of wood and sold them in the market; then for a small
part of the price which I got for them, I bought a second supply of
gram, and in the same way on a second day I obtained wood from the
wood-cutters. Doing this every day I gradually acquired capital, and I
bought from those wood-cutters all their wood for three days. Then
suddenly there befell a dearth of wood on account of heavy rains, and I
sold that wood for many hundred <i>pa&#7751;as</i>, with that wealth I
set up a shop, and engaging in traffic, I have become a very wealthy
man by my own ability. Then I made a mouse of gold, and gave it to that
Vi&#347;&aacute;khila, then he gave me his daughter; and in consequence
of my history I am known in the world by the name of Mouse. So without
a coin in the world I acquired this prosperity. All the other merchants
then, when they heard this story, were astonished. How can the mind
help being amazed at pictures without walls?<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Story of the chanter of the S&aacute;ma Veda.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In another place a Br&aacute;hman who had got eight
gold <i>m&aacute;shas</i> as a present, a chanter of the S&aacute;ma
Veda, received the following piece of advice from a man who was a bit
of a <i>rou&eacute;</i>, &ldquo;You get enough to live upon by your
position as a Br&aacute;hman, so you ought now to employ this gold for
the purpose of learning the way of the world in order that you may
become a knowing fellow.&rdquo; The fool said &ldquo;Who will teach
me?&rdquo; Thereupon the <i>rou&eacute;</i> said to him, &ldquo;This
lady<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2649src" href="#xd27e2649" name=
"xd27e2649src">8</a> named Chaturik&aacute;, go to her house.&rdquo;
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>Br&aacute;hman said, &ldquo;What am I to do
there&rdquo;? The <i>rou&eacute;</i> replied&mdash;&ldquo;Give her
gold, and in order to please her make use of some
<i>s&aacute;ma</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2668src" href=
"#xd27e2668" name="xd27e2668src">9</a> When he heard this, the chanter
went quickly to the house of Chaturik&aacute;; when he entered, the
lady advanced to meet him and he took a seat. Then that Br&aacute;hman
gave her the gold and faltered out the request, &ldquo;Teach me now for
this fee the way of the world.&rdquo; Thereupon the people who were
there began to titter, and he, after reflecting a little, putting his
hands together in the shape of a cow&rsquo;s ear, so that they formed a
kind of pipe, began, like a stupid idiot, to chant with a shrill sound
the S&aacute;ma Veda, so that all the <i>rou&eacute;s</i> in the house
came together to see the fun; and they said &ldquo;Whence has this
jackal blundered in here? Come, let us quickly give him the
half-moon<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2680src" href="#xd27e2680" name=
"xd27e2680src">10</a> on his throat.&rdquo; Thereupon the
Br&aacute;hman supposing that the half-moon meant an arrow with a head
of that shape, and afraid of having his head cut off, rushed out of the
house, bellowing out, &ldquo;I have learnt the way of the world;&rdquo;
then he went to the man who had sent him, and told him the whole story.
He replied &ldquo;when I told you to use <i>s&aacute;ma</i>, I meant
coaxing and wheedling; what is the propriety of introducing the Veda in
a matter of this kind? The fact is, I suppose, that stupidity is
engrained in a man who muddles his head with the Vedas?&rdquo; So he
spoke, bursting with laughter all the while, and went off to the
lady&rsquo;s house, and said to her, &ldquo;Give back to that
two-legged cow his gold-fodder.&rdquo; So she laughing gave back the
money, and when the Br&aacute;hman got it, he went back to his house as
happy as if he had been born again.</p>
<p>Witnessing strange scenes of this kind at every step, I reached the
palace of the king which was like the court of Indra. And then I
entered it, with my pupils going before to herald my arrival, and saw
the king S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana sitting in his hall of audience upon
a jewelled throne, surrounded by his ministers, &#346;arvavarman and
his colleagues, as Indra is by the gods. After I had blessed him and
had taken a seat, and had been honoured by the king, &#346;arvavarman
and the other ministers praised me in the following words, &ldquo;This
man, O king, is famous upon the earth as skilled in all lore, and
therefore his name Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2690src" href="#xd27e2690" name="xd27e2690src">11</a> is a true
index of his nature.&rdquo; S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana hearing me praised
in this style by his ministers, was pleased with me and immediately
entertained me honourably, and appointed me to the office of Minister.
Then I married a wife, and lived there comfortably, looking after the
king&rsquo;s affairs and instructing my pupils. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Once, as I was roaming about at leisure on the banks of the
God&aacute;var&iacute; out of curiosity, I beheld a garden called
Dev&iacute;k&#7771;iti, and seeing that it was an exceedingly pleasant
garden, like an earthly Nandana,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2698src"
href="#xd27e2698" name="xd27e2698src">12</a> I asked the gardener how
it came there, and he said to me, &ldquo;My lord, according to the
story which we hear from old people, long ago there came here a certain
Br&aacute;hman who observed a vow of silence and abstained from food,
he made this heavenly garden with a temple; then all the
Br&aacute;hmans assembled here out of curiosity, and that
Br&aacute;hman being persistently asked by them told his history. There
is in this land a province called Vakakachchha on the banks of the
Narmad&aacute;, in that district I was born as a Br&aacute;hman, and in
former times no one gave me alms, as I was lazy as well as poor; then
in a fit of annoyance I quitted my house being disgusted with life, and
wandering round the holy places, I came to visit the shrine of
Durg&aacute; the dweller in the Vindhya hills, and having beheld that
goddess, I reflected, &lsquo;People propitiate with animal offerings
this giver of boons, but I will slay myself here, stupid beast that I
am.&rsquo; Having formed this resolve, I took in hand a sword to cut
off my head. Immediately that goddess being propitious, herself said to
me, &lsquo;Son, thou art perfected, do not slay thyself, remain near
me;&rsquo; thus I obtained a boon from the goddess and attained divine
nature; from that day forth my hunger and thirst disappeared; then once
on a time, as I was remaining there, that goddess herself said to me,
&lsquo;Go, my son, and plant in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na a glorious
garden;&rsquo; thus speaking, she gave me, with her own hands, heavenly
seed; thereupon I came here and made this beautiful garden by means of
her power; and this garden you must keep in good order. Having said
this, he disappeared. In this way this garden was made by the goddess
long ago, my lord.&rdquo; When I had heard from the gardener this
signal manifestation of the favour of the goddess, I went home
penetrated with wonder.</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya had said this,
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti asked, &ldquo;Why, my lord, was the king
called S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana?&rdquo; Then
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya said, Listen, I will tell you the reason.
There was a king of great power named Dv&iacute;pikar&#7751;i. He had a
wife named &#346;aktimat&iacute;, whom he valued more than life, and
once upon a time a snake bit her as she was sleeping in the garden.
Thereupon she died, and that king thinking only of her, though he had
no son, took a vow of perpetual chastity. Then once upon a time the god
of the moony crest said to him in a dream&mdash;&ldquo;While wandering
in the forest thou shalt behold a boy mounted on a lion, take him and
go home, he shall be thy son.&rdquo; Then the king woke up, and
rejoiced remembering that dream, and one day in his passion for the
chase he went to a distant wood; there in the middle of the day that
king beheld on the bank of a lotus-lake a boy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>splendid
as the sun, riding on a lion; the lion desiring to drink water set down
the boy, and then the king remembering his dream slew it with one
arrow. The creature thereupon abandoned the form of a lion, and
suddenly assumed the shape of a man; the king exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas!
what means this? tell me!&rdquo; and then the man answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;O king, I am a Yaksha of the name of S&aacute;ta, an
attendant upon the god of wealth; long ago I beheld the daughter of a
&#7770;ishi bathing in the Ganges; she too, when she beheld me, felt
love arise in her breast, like myself: then I made her my wife by the
G&aacute;ndharva form of marriage; and her relatives, finding it out,
in their anger cursed me and her, saying, &ldquo;You two wicked ones,
doing what is right in your own eyes, shall become lions.&rdquo; The
hermit-folk appointed that her curse should end when she gave birth to
offspring, and that mine should continue longer, until I was slain by
thee with an arrow. So we became a pair of lions; she in course of time
became pregnant, and then died after this boy was born, but I brought
him up on the milk of other lionesses, and lo! to-day I am released
from my curse having been smitten by thee with an arrow. Therefore
receive this noble son which I give thee, for this thing was foretold
long ago by those hermit-folk.&rdquo; Having said this that Guhyaka
named S&aacute;ta disappeared,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2716src"
href="#xd27e2716" name="xd27e2716src">13</a> and the king taking the
boy went home; and because he had ridden upon S&aacute;ta he gave the
boy the name of S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana, and in course of time he
established him in his kingdom. Then, when that king
Dv&iacute;pikar&#7751;i went to the forest, this
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana became sovereign of the whole earth.</p>
<p>Having said this in the middle of his tale in answer to
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti&rsquo;s question, the wise
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya again called to mind and went on with the
main thread of his narrative. Then once upon a time, in the spring
festival that king S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana went to visit the garden
made by the goddess, of which I spake before. He roamed there for a
long time like Indra in the garden of Nandana, and descended into the
water of the lake to amuse himself in company with his wives. There he
sprinkled his beloved ones sportively with water flung by his hands,
and was sprinkled by them in return like an elephant by its females.
His wives with faces, the eyes of which were slightly reddened by the
collyrium washed into them, and which were streaming with water, and
with bodies the proportions of which were revealed by their clinging
garments, pelted him vigorously; and as the wind strips the creepers in
the forest of leaves and flowers, so he made his fair ones who fled
into the adjoining shrubbery lose the marks on their foreheads<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2721src" href="#xd27e2721" name=
"xd27e2721src">14</a> and their ornaments. Then one of his queens tardy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>with the weight of her breasts, with body tender
as a <i>&#347;ir&iacute;sha</i> flower, became exhausted with the
amusement; she not being able to endure more, said to the king who was
sprinkling her with water,&mdash;&ldquo;do not pelt me with
water-drops;&rdquo; on hearing that, the king quickly had some
sweetmeats<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2734src" href="#xd27e2734" name=
"xd27e2734src">15</a> brought; then the queen burst out laughing and
said again&mdash;&ldquo;king, what do we want with sweetmeats in the
water? For I said to you, do not sprinkle me with water-drops. Do you
not even understand the coalescence of the words <i>m&aacute;</i> and
<i>udaka</i>, and do you not know that chapter of the
grammar,&mdash;how can you be such a blockhead?&rdquo; When the queen,
who knew grammatical treatises, said this to him, and the attendants
laughed, the king was at once overpowered with secret shame; he left
off romping in the water and immediately entered his own palace
unperceived, crest-fallen, and full of self-contempt. Then he remained
lost in thought, bewildered, averse to food and other enjoyments, and,
like a picture, even when asked a question, he answered nothing.
Thinking that his only resource was to acquire learning or die, he
flung himself down on a couch, and remained in an agony of grief. Then
all the king&rsquo;s attendants, seeing that he had suddenly fallen
into such a state, were utterly beside themselves to think what it
could mean. Then I and &#346;arvavarman came at last to hear of the
king&rsquo;s condition, and by that time the day was almost at an end.
So perceiving that the king was still in an unsatisfactory condition,
we immediately summoned a servant of the king named R&aacute;jahansa.
And he<span class="corr" id="xd27e2765" title="Not in source">,</span>
when asked by us about the state of the king&rsquo;s health, said
this&mdash;&ldquo;I never before in my life saw the king in such a
state of depression: and the other queens told me with much indignation
that he had been humiliated to-day by that superficial blue-stocking,
the daughter of Vish&#7751;u&#347;akti.&rdquo; When &#346;arvavarman
and I had heard this from the mouth of the king&rsquo;s servant, we
fell into a state of despondency, and thus reflected in our dilemma;
&ldquo;If the king were afflicted with bodily disease, we might
introduce the physicians, but if his disease is mental it is impossible
to find the cause of it. For there is no enemy in his country the
thorns of which are destroyed, and these subjects are attached to him;
no dearth of any kind is to be seen; so how can this sudden melancholy
of the king&rsquo;s have arisen?&rdquo; After we had debated to this
effect, the wise &#346;arvavarman said as follows&mdash;&ldquo;I know
the cause, this king is distressed by sorrow for his own ignorance, for
he is always expressing a desire for culture, saying &lsquo;I am a
blockhead;&rsquo; I long ago detected this desire of his, and we have
heard that the occasion of the present fit is his having been
humiliated by the queen.&rdquo; Thus we debated with one another and
after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>we had passed that night, in the morning we went
to the private apartments of the sovereign. There, though strict orders
had been given that no one was to enter, I managed to get in with
difficulty, and after me &#346;arvavarman slipped in quickly. I then
sat down near the king and asked him this question&mdash;&ldquo;Why, O
king, art thou without cause thus despondent?&rdquo; Though he heard
this, S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana nevertheless remained silent, and then
&#346;arvavarman uttered this extraordinary speech, &ldquo;King, thou
didst long ago say to me, &lsquo;Make me a learned man.&rsquo; Thinking
upon that I employed last night a charm to produce a dream.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2770src" href="#xd27e2770" name=
"xd27e2770src">16</a> Then I saw in my dream a lotus fallen from
heaven, and it was opened by some heavenly youth, and out of it came a
divine woman in white garments, and immediately, O king, she entered
thy mouth. When I had seen so much I woke up, and I think without doubt
that the woman who visibly entered thy mouth was
Sarasvat&iacute;.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> As soon as &#346;arvavarman had in these
terms described his dream, the king broke his silence and said to me
with the utmost earnestness,&mdash;&ldquo;In how short a time can a
man, who is diligently taught, acquire learning? Tell me this. For
without learning all this regal splendour has no charms for me. What is
the use of rank and power to a blockhead? They are like ornaments on a
log of wood.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;King, it is invariably the case
that it takes men twelve years to learn grammar, the gate to all
knowledge. But I, my sovereign, will teach it you in six years.&rdquo;
When he heard that, &#346;arvavarman suddenly exclaimed in a fit of
jealousy&mdash;&ldquo;How can a man accustomed to enjoyment endure
hardship for so long? So I will teach you grammar, my prince, in six
months.&rdquo; When I heard this promise which it seemed impossible to
make good, I said to him in a rage, &ldquo;If you teach the king in six
months, I renounce at once and for ever Sanskrit, Prak&#7771;it, and
the vernacular dialect, these three languages which pass current among
men;<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2782src" href="#xd27e2782" name=
"xd27e2782src">17</a> then &#346;arvavarman said&mdash;&ldquo;And if I
do not do this, I &#346;arvavarman, will carry your shoes on my head
for twelve years.&rdquo; Having said this he went out; I too went home;
and the king for his part was comforted, expecting that he would attain
his object by means of one of us two. Now &#346;arvavarman being in a
dilemma, seeing that his promise was one very difficult to perform, and
regretting what he had done, told the whole story to his wife, and she
grieved to hear it said to him, &ldquo;My lord, in this difficulty
there is no way of escape for you except the favour of the Lord
K&aacute;rtikeya.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd27e2787src"
href="#xd27e2787" name="xd27e2787src">18</a> &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo;
said &#346;arvavarman and determined to implore it. Accordingly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>in the last watch of the night, &#346;arvavarman
set out fasting for the shrine of the god. Now I came to hear of it by
means of my secret emissaries, and in the morning I told the king of
it; and he, when he heard it, wondered what would happen. Then a trusty
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t called Sinhagupta said to him, &ldquo;When I
heard, O king, that thou wast afflicted I was seized with great
despondency. Then I went out of this city, and was preparing to cut off
my own head before the goddess Durg&aacute; in order to ensure thy
happiness. Then a voice from heaven forbade me, saying, &lsquo;Do not
so, the king&rsquo;s wish shall be fulfilled.&rsquo; Therefore, I
believe, thou art sure of success.&rdquo; When he had said this, that
Sinhagupta took leave of the king, and rapidly despatched two
emissaries after &#346;arvavarman; who feeding only on air, observing a
vow of silence, steadfast in resolution, reached at last the shrine of
the Lord K&aacute;rtikeya. There, pleased with his penance that spared
not the body, K&aacute;rtikeya favoured him according to his desire;
then the two spies sent by Sinhagupta came into the king&rsquo;s
presence and reported the minister&rsquo;s success. On hearing that
news the king was delighted and I was despondent, as the
<i>ch&aacute;&#7789;aka</i> joys, and the swan grieves, on seeing the
cloud.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2795src" href="#xd27e2795" name=
"xd27e2795src">19</a> Then &#346;arvavarman arrived successful by the
favour of K&aacute;rtikeya, and communicated to the king all the
sciences, which presented themselves to him on his thinking of them.
And immediately they were revealed to the king
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana. For what cannot the grace of the Supreme Lord
accomplish? Then the kingdom rejoiced on hearing that the king had thus
obtained all knowledge, and there was high festival kept throughout it;
and that moment banners were flaunted from every house, and being
fanned by the wind, seemed to dance. Then &#346;arvavarman was honoured
with abundance of jewels fit for a king by the sovereign, who bowed
humbly before him, calling him his spiritual preceptor, and he was made
governor of the territory called Vakakachchha, which lies along the
bank of the Narmad&aacute;. The king being highly pleased with that
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t Sinhagupta, who first heard by the mouth of his
spies, that the boon had been obtained from the six-faced god,<a class=

Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na according to Wilson is celebrated as the
capital of &#346;aliv&aacute;hana. It is identifiable with Peytan on
the God&aacute;var&iacute;, the Bathana or Paithana of
Ptolemy,&mdash;the capital of Siripolemaios. Wilson identifies this
name with &#346;aliv&aacute;hana, but Dr. Rost remarks that Lassen more
correctly identifies it with that of &#346;r&iacute; Pulim&aacute;n of
the Andhra dynasty who reigned at Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na after the
overthrow of the house of &#346;aliv&aacute;hana about 130 A.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then, having taken a vow of silence, I came into the
presence of the sovereign, and there a certain Br&aacute;hman recited a
<i>&#347;loka</i> he had composed, and the king himself addressed him
correctly in the Sanskrit language; and the people who were present in
court were delighted when they witnessed that. Then the king said
deferentially to &#346;arvavarman&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me thyself after
what fashion the god shewed thee favour.&rdquo; Hearing that,
&#346;arvavarman proceeded to relate to the king the whole story of
K&aacute;rtikeya&rsquo;s favourable acceptance of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went, O king, on that occasion fasting and silent from this
place, so when the journey came to an end, being very despondent, and
emaciated with my severe austerities, worn out I fell senseless on the
ground. Then, I remember, a man with a spear in his hand came and said
to me in distinct accents, &lsquo;Rise up, my son, everything shall
turn out favourably for thee.&rsquo; By that speech I was, as it were,
immediately bedewed with a shower of nectar, and I woke up, and seemed
free from hunger and thirst and in good ease. Then I approached the
neighbourhood of the god&rsquo;s temple, overpowered with the weight of
my devotion, and after bathing I entered the inner shrine of the god in
a state of agitated suspense. Then that Lord Skanda<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2825src" href="#xd27e2825" name="xd27e2825src">1</a> gave me a
sight of himself within, and thereupon Sarasvat&iacute; in visible
shape entered my mouth. So that holy god, manifested before me, recited
the <i>s&uacute;tra</i> beginning &lsquo;the traditional doctrine of
letters.&rsquo; On hearing that, I, with the levity which is so natural
to mankind, guessed the next <i>s&uacute;tra</i> and uttered it myself.
Then that god said to me, &lsquo;if thou hadst not uttered it thyself,
this grammatical treatise would have supplanted that of
P&aacute;&#7751;ini. As it is, on account of its conciseness, it shall
be called K&aacute;tantra, and K&aacute;l&aacute;paka, from the tail
(<i lang="sa-latn">kal&aacute;pa</i>) of the peacock on which I
ride.&rsquo; Having said this, that god himself in visible form
revealed to me that new and short grammar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2837src" href="#xd27e2837" name="xd27e2837src">2</a> and then
added this besides; &lsquo;That king of thine in a former birth was
himself a holy sage, a pupil of the hermit Bharadv&aacute;ja, named
<span class="corr" id="xd27e2847" title=
"Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>, great in austerity:
and he, having beheld a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>hermit&rsquo;s daughter who loved him
in return, suddenly felt the smart of the wound which the shaft of the
flowery-arrowed god inflicts. So, having been cursed by the hermits, he
has now become incarnate here, and that hermit&rsquo;s daughter has
become incarnate as his queen.</p>
<p>So this king S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana, being an incarnation of a
holy sage,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2854src" href="#xd27e2854" name=
"xd27e2854src">3</a> when he beholds thee, will attain a knowledge of
all the sciences according to thy wish. For the highest matters are
easily acquired by great-souled ones, having been learnt in a former
birth, the real truth of them being recalled by their powerful
memories.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2857src" href="#xd27e2857"
name="xd27e2857src">4</a> When the god had said this, he disappeared,
and I went out, and there grains of rice were presented me by the
god&rsquo;s servants. Then I proceeded to return, O king, and wonderful
to say, though I consumed those grains on my journey day after day,
they remained as numerous as ever.&rdquo; When he had related his
adventure, &#346;arvavarman ceased speaking, and king
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana in cheerful mood rose up and went to
bathe.</p>
<p>Then I, being excluded from business by my vow of silence, took
leave, with a low bow only, of that king who was very averse to part
with me, and went out of that town, accompanied by only two disciples,
and, with my mind bent on the performance of austerities, came to visit
the shrine of the dweller in the Vindhya hills, and having been
directed by the goddess in a dream to visit thee, I entered for that
purpose this terrible Vindhya forest. A hint given by a Pulinda enabled
me to find a caravan, and so somehow or other, by the special favour of
destiny, I managed to arrive here, and beheld this host of
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, and by hearing from a distance their conversation
with one another, I have contrived to learn this Pai&#347;&aacute;cha
language, which has enabled me to break my vow of silence; I then made
use of it to ask after you, and, hearing that you had gone to
Ujjayin&iacute;, I waited here until your return; on beholding you I
welcomed you in the fourth language, (the speech of the
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas), and then I called to mind my origin; this is the
story of my adventures in this birth.</p>
<p>When Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya had said this,
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;hear, how your
arrival was made known to me last night. I have a friend, a
R&aacute;kshasa of the name of Bh&uacute;tivarman, who possesses
heavenly insight; and I went to a garden in Ujjayin&iacute;, where he
resides. On my asking him when my own curse would come to an end, he
said, we have no power in the day, wait, and I will tell you at night.
I consented and when night came on, I asked him earnestly the reason
why goblins<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2871src" href="#xd27e2871" name=
"xd27e2871src">5</a> delighted in disporting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>themselves then, as they were doing. Then
Bh&uacute;tivarman said to me, &lsquo;Listen, I will relate what I
heard &#346;iva say in a conversation with Brahm&aacute;.
R&aacute;kshasas, Yakshas, and Pi&#347;&aacute;chas have no power in
the day, being dazed with the brightness of the sun, therefore they
delight in the night. And where the gods are not worshipped, and the
Br&aacute;hmans, in due form, and where men eat contrary to the holy
law, there also they have power. Where there is a man who abstains from
flesh, or a virtuous woman, there they do not go. They never attack
chaste men, heroes, and men awake.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2879src" href="#xd27e2879" name="xd27e2879src">6</a> When he said
this on that occasion Bh&uacute;tivarman continued, &lsquo;Go, for
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya has arrived, the destined means of thy
release from the curse.&rsquo; So hearing this, I have come, and I have
seen thee, my lord; now I will relate to thee that tale which
Pushpadanta told; but I feel curiosity on one point; tell me why he was
called Pushpadanta and thou M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hearing this question from
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya said to him.
On the bank of the Ganges there is a district granted to
Br&aacute;hmans by royal charter, named Bahusuvar&#7751;aka, and there
lived there a very learned Br&aacute;hman named Govindadatta, and he
had a wife Agnidatt&aacute; who was devoted to her husband. In course
of time that Br&aacute;hman had five sons by her. And they, being
handsome but stupid, grew up insolent fellows. Then a guest came to the
house of Govindadatta, a Br&aacute;hman Vai&#347;v&aacute;nara by name,
like a second god of fire.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2890src" href=
"#xd27e2890" name="xd27e2890src">7</a> As Govindadatta was away from
home when he arrived, he came and saluted his sons, and they only
responded to his salute with a laugh; then that Br&aacute;hman in a
rage prepared to depart from his house. While he was in this state of
wrath Govindadatta came, and asked the cause, and did his best to
appease him, but the excellent Br&aacute;hman nevertheless spoke as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;Your sons have become outcasts, as being
blockheads, and you have lost caste by associating with them, therefore
I will not eat in your house; if I did so, I should not be able to
purify myself by any expiatory ceremony.&rdquo; Then Govindadatta said
to him with an oath, &ldquo;I will never even touch these wicked sons
of mine.&rdquo; His hospitable wife also came and said the same to her
guest; then Vai&#347;v&aacute;nara was with difficulty induced to
accept their hospitality. One of <span class="corr" id="xd27e2893"
title="Source: Gurudatta&rsquo;s">Govindadatta&rsquo;s</span> sons,
named Devadatta, when he saw that, was grieved at his father&rsquo;s
sternness, and thinking a life of no value which was thus branded by
his parents, went in a state of despondency to the hermitage of
Badarik&aacute; to perform penance; there he first ate leaves, and
afterwards he fed only on smoke, persevering in a long course of
austerities in order to propitiate the husband of Um&aacute;<a class=
"noteref" id="n55csrc" href="#n55c" name="n55csrc">8</a>. So
&#346;ambhu,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n55c">8</a> won over by his
severe austerities, manifested <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>himself to him, and he craved a
boon from the god, that he might ever attend upon him. &#346;ambhu thus
commanded him&mdash;&ldquo;Acquire learning, and enjoy pleasures on the
earth, and after that thou shalt attain all thy desire.&rdquo; Then he,
eager for learning, went to the city of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and
according to custom waited on an instructor named Vedakumbha. When he
was there, the wife of his preceptor distracted by passion, which had
arisen in her heart, made violent love to him; alas! the fancies of
women are ever inconstant! Accordingly Devadatta left that place, as
his studies had been thus interfered with by the god of love, and went
to Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na with unwearied zeal. There he repaired to
an old preceptor named Mantrasv&aacute;min, with an old wife, and
acquired a perfect knowledge of the sciences. And after he had acquired
learning, the daughter of the king Su&#347;arman, &#346;r&iacute; by
name, cast eyes upon the handsome youth, as the goddess &#346;r&iacute;
upon Vish&#7751;u. He also beheld that maiden at a window, looking like
the presiding goddess of the moon, roaming through the air in a magic
chariot. Those two were, as it were, fastened together by that look
which was the chain of love, and were unable to separate. The
king&rsquo;s daughter made him a sign to come near with one finger,
looking like Love&rsquo;s command in fleshly form. Then he came near
her, and she came out of the women&rsquo;s apartments, and took with
her teeth a flower and threw it down to him. He, not understanding this
mysterious sign made by the princess, puzzled as to what he ought to
do, went home to his preceptor. There he rolled on the ground unable to
utter a word, being consumed within with burning pain, like one dumb
and distracted; his wise preceptor guessing what was the matter by
these love-symptoms, artfully questioned him, and at last he was with
difficulty persuaded to tell the whole story. Then the clever preceptor
guessed the riddle, and said to him,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2904src" href="#xd27e2904" name="xd27e2904src">9</a> &ldquo;By
letting drop a flower with her tooth she made a sign to you, that you
were to go to this temple rich in flowers called Pushpadanta, and wait
there: so you had better go now.&rdquo; When he heard this and knew the
meaning of the sign, the youth forgot his grief. Then he went into that
temple and remained there. The princess on her part also went there,
giving as an excuse that it was the eighth day of the month, and then
entered the inner shrine in order to present herself alone before the
god; then she touched her lover who was behind the panel of the door,
and he suddenly springing up threw his arms round her neck. She
exclaimed, &ldquo;this is strange; how did you guess the meaning of
that sign of mine?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;it was my preceptor that
found it out, not I.&rdquo; Then the princess flew into a passion and
said, &ldquo;Let me go, you are a dolt,&rdquo; and immediately rushed
out of the temple, fearing that her secret would be discovered.
Devadatta on his part went away, and thinking in solitude on his
beloved, who was no sooner seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>than lost to his eyes, was in
such a state that the taper of his life was well nigh melted away in
the fire of bereavement. &#346;iva, who had been before propitiated by
him, commanded an attendant of his, of the name of Pancha&#347;ikha, to
procure for him the desire of his heart. That excellent Ga&#7751;a
thereupon came, and consoled him, and caused him to assume the dress of
a woman, and he himself wore the semblance of an aged Br&aacute;hman.
Then that worthy Ga&#7751;a went with him to king Su&#347;arman the
father of that bright-eyed one, and said to him; &ldquo;My son has been
sent away somewhere, I go to seek him: accordingly I deposit with thee
this daughter-in-law of mine, keep her safely, O king.&rdquo; Hearing
that, king Su&#347;arman afraid of a Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s curse, took
the young man and placed him in his daughter&rsquo;s guarded seraglio,
supposing him to be a woman. Then after the departure of
Pancha&#347;ikha, the Br&aacute;hman dwelt in woman&rsquo;s clothes in
the seraglio of his beloved, and became her trusted confidante. Once on
a time the princess was full of regretful longing at night, so he
discovered himself to her and secretly married her by the
G&aacute;ndharva form of marriage. And when she became pregnant, that
excellent Ga&#7751;a came on his thinking of him only, and carried him
away at night without its being perceived. Then he quickly rent off
from the young man his woman&rsquo;s dress, and in the morning
Pancha&#347;ikha resumed the semblance of a Br&aacute;hman; and going
with the young man to the king Su&#347;arman he said; &ldquo;O king, I
have this day found my son: so give me back my daughter-in-law.&rdquo;
Then the king, supposing that she had fled somewhere at night, alarmed
at the prospect of being cursed by the Br&aacute;hman, said this to his
ministers. &ldquo;This is no Br&aacute;hman, this is some god come to
deceive me, for such things often happen in this world.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king &#346;ivi.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So in former times there was a king named &#346;ivi,
self-denying, compassionate, generous, resolute, the protector of all
creatures; and in order to beguile him Indra assumed the shape of a
hawk, and swiftly pursued Dharma,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2919src"
href="#xd27e2919" name="xd27e2919src">10</a> who by magic had
transformed himself into a dove. The dove in terror went and took
refuge in the bosom of &#346;ivi. Then the hawk addressed the king with
a human voice; &lsquo;O king, this is my natural food, surrender the
dove to me, for I am hungry. Know that my death will immediately follow
if you refuse my prayer; in that case where will be your
righteousness?&rsquo; Then &#346;ivi said to the god,&mdash;&lsquo;this
creature has fled to me for protection, and I cannot abandon it,
therefore I will give you an equal weight of some other kind of
flesh.&rsquo; The hawk said, &lsquo;if this be so, then give me your
own flesh.&rsquo; The king, delighted, consented to do so. But as fast
as he cut off his flesh and threw it on the scale, the dove seemed to
weigh more and more in the balance. Then the king threw his whole body
on to the scale, and thereupon a celestial voice was heard, &lsquo;Well
done! this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>is equal in weight to the dove.&rsquo; Then Indra
and Dharma abandoned the form of hawk and dove, and being highly
pleased restored the body of king &#346;ivi whole as before, and, after
bestowing on him many other blessings, they both disappeared. In the
same way this Br&aacute;hman is some god that has come to prove
me.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2924src" href="#xd27e2924" name=
"xd27e2924src">11</a></p>
<p>Having said this to his ministers, that king Su&#347;arman of his
own motion said to that excellent Ga&#7751;a that had assumed the form
of a Br&aacute;hman, prostrating himself before him in fear,
&ldquo;Spare me; that daughter-in-law of thine was carried off last
night. She has been taken somewhere or other by magic arts, though
guarded night and day.&rdquo; Then the Ga&#7751;a, who had assumed the
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s semblance, pretending to be with difficulty won
over to pity him, said, &ldquo;If this be so, king, give thy daughter
in marriage to my son.&rdquo; When he heard this, the king afraid of
being cursed, gave his own daughter to Devadatta: then Pancha&#347;ikha
departed. Then Devadatta having recovered his beloved, and that in an
open manner, flourished in the power and splendour of his father-in-law
who had no son but him. And in course of time Su&#347;arman anointed
the son of his daughter by Devadatta, Mah&iacute;dhara by name, as
successor in his room, and retired to the forest. Then having seen the
prosperity of his son, Devadatta considered that he had attained all
his objects, and he too with the princess retired to the forest. There
he again propitiated &#346;iva, and having laid aside his mortal body,
by the special favour of the god he attained the position of a
Ga&#7751;a. Because he did not understand the sign given by the flower
dropped from the tooth of his beloved, therefore he became known by the
name of Pushpadanta in the assembly of the Ga&#7751;as. And his wife
became a door-keeper in the house of the goddess, under the name of
Jay&aacute;: this is how he came to be called Pushpadanta: now hear the
origin of my name.</p>
<p>Long ago I was a son of that same Br&aacute;hman called Govindadatta
the father of Devadatta, and my name was Somadatta. I left my home
indignant for the same reason as Devadatta, and I performed austerities
on the Him&aacute;laya continually striving to propitiate &#346;iva
with offerings of many garlands. The god of the moony crest, being
pleased, revealed himself to me in the same way as he did to my
brother, and I chose the privilege of attending upon him as a
Ga&#7751;a, not being desirous of lower pleasures. The husband of the
daughter of the mountain, that mighty god, thus addressed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>me;
&ldquo;Because I have been worshipped by thee with garlands of flowers
growing in trackless forest-regions, brought with thy own hand,
therefore thou shalt be one of my Ga&#7751;as, and shalt bear the name
of M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n.&rdquo; Then I cast off my mortal frame, and
immediately attained the holy state of an attendant on the god. And so
my name of M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n was bestowed upon me by him who wears
the burden of the matted locks,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2966src"
href="#xd27e2966" name="xd27e2966src">12</a> as a mark of his special
favour. And I, that very M&aacute;lyav&aacute;n, have once more, O
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti, been degraded to the state of a mortal,
as thou seest, owing to the curse of the daughter of the mountain,
therefore do thou now tell me the tale told by &#346;iva, in order that
the state of curse of both of us may cease.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In accordance with this request of
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya that heavenly tale consisting of seven
stories was told by K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti in his own language,
and Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya for his part using the same
Pai&#347;&aacute;cha language threw them into seven hundred thousand
couplets in seven years; and that great poet, for fear that the
Vidy&aacute;dharas should steal his composition, wrote it with his own
blood in the forest, not possessing ink. And so the <span class="corr"
id="xd27e3014" title=
"Source: Vidhy&aacute;dharas">Vidy&aacute;dharas</span>, Siddhas and
other demigods came to hear it, and the heaven above where
K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti was reciting, was, as it were,
continually covered with a canopy. And K&aacute;&#7751;abh&uacute;ti,
when he had seen that great tale composed by
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya, was released from his curse and went to
his own place. There were also other Pi&#347;&aacute;chas that
accompanied him in his wanderings: they too all of them attained
heaven, having heard that heavenly tale. Then that great poet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya began to reflect,
&ldquo;I must make this Great Tale<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3019src"
href="#xd27e3019" name="xd27e3019src">1</a> of mine current on the
earth, for that is the condition that the goddess mentioned when she
revealed how my curse would end. Then how shall I make it current? To
whom shall I give it?&rdquo; Then his two disciples that had followed
him, one of whom was called Gu&#7751;adeva, and the other Nandideva
said to him, &ldquo;The glorious S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana alone is a
fit person to give this poem to, for being a man of taste he will
diffuse the poem far and wide, as the wind diffuses the perfume of the
flower.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya, and gave the book to those two
accomplished disciples and sent them to that king with it; and went
himself to that same Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, but remained outside
the city in the garden planted by the goddess, where he arranged that
they should meet him. And his disciples went and showed the poem to
king S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana, telling him at the same time that it was
the work of Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya. When he heard that
Pai&#347;&aacute;cha language and saw that they had the appearance of
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, that king, led astray by pride of learning, said
with a sneer, &ldquo;The seven hundred thousand couplets are a weighty
authority, but the Pai&#347;&aacute;cha language is barbarous, and the
letters are written in blood; away with this Pai&#347;&aacute;cha
tale.&rdquo; Then the two pupils took the book, and returned by the way
which they came, and told the whole circumstance to
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya. Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya for his part,
when he heard it, was immediately overcome with sorrow; who indeed is
not inly grieved when scorned by a competent authority? Then he went
with his disciples to a craggy hill at no great distance, in an
unfrequented but pleasant spot, and first prepared a consecrated fire
cavity. Then he took the leaves one by one, and after he had read them
aloud to the beasts and birds, he flung them into the fire while his
disciples looked on with tearful eyes. But he reserved one story,
consisting of one hundred thousand couplets, containing the history of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, for the sake of his two disciples, as they
particularly fancied it. And while he was reading out and burning that
heavenly tale, all the deer, boars, buffaloes and other wild animals,
came there, leaving the pasturage, and formed a circle around him,
listening with tears in their eyes, unable to quit the spot.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3022src" href="#xd27e3022" name=
"xd27e3022src">2</a></p>
<p>In the meanwhile king S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana fell sick. And the
physicians said that his illness was due to eating meat wanting in
nutritive qualities. And when the cooks were scolded for it, they
said&mdash;&ldquo;The hunters bring in to us flesh of this kind.&rdquo;
And when the hunters were taken to task, they said,&mdash;&ldquo;On a
hill not very far from here there is a Br&aacute;hman reading, who
throws into the fire every leaf as soon as he has read it; so all the
animals go there and listen without ever grazing, they never wander
anywhere else, consequently this flesh of theirs is wanting in
nutritive properties on account <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>of their going without
food.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of the hunters he made them shew
him the way, and out of curiosity went in person to see
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya, and he beheld him owing to his forest life
overspread with matted locks, that looked like the smoke of the fire of
his curse, that was almost extinguished.</p>
<p>Then the king recognized him as he stood in the midst of the weeping
animals, and after he had respectfully saluted him, he asked him for an
explanation of all the circumstances. That wise Br&aacute;hman then
related to the king in the language of the demons his own history as
Pushpadanta, giving an account of the curse and all the circumstances
which originated the descent of the tale to earth. Then the king,
discovering that he was an incarnation of a Ga&#7751;a, bowed at his
feet, and asked him for that celestial tale that had issued from the
mouth of &#346;iva. Then Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya said to that king
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana; &ldquo;O king I have burnt six tales
containing six hundred thousand couplets; but here is one tale
consisting of a hundred thousand couplets, take that:<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3031src" href="#xd27e3031" name="xd27e3031src">3</a> and these
two pupils of mine shall explain it to you.&rdquo; So spake
Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya and took leave of the king, and then by
strength of devotion laid aside his earthly body, and released from the
curse ascended to his own heavenly home. Then the king took that tale
which Gu&#7751;&aacute;&#7693;hya had given, called V&#7771;ihat
Kath&aacute;, containing the adventures of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and
went to his own city. And there he bestowed on Gu&#7751;adeva and
Nandideva, the pupils of the poet who composed that tale, lands, gold,
garments, beasts of burden, palaces, and treasures. And having
recovered the sense of that tale with their help,
S&aacute;tav&aacute;hana composed the book named
Kath&aacute;p&iacute;&#7789;ha, in order to shew how the tale came to
be first made known in the Pai&#347;&aacute;cha language. Now that tale
was so full of various interest, that men were so taken up with it as
to forget the tales of the gods, and after producing that effect in the
city it attained uninterrupted renown in the three worlds. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of Udayana king of Vatsa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a land famous under the name of Vatsa, that
appears as if it had been made by the Creator as an earthly rival to
dash the pride of heaven. In the centre of it is a great city named
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, the favourite dwelling-place of the
goddess of prosperity; the ear-ornament, so to speak, of the earth. In
it dwelt a king named &#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka, sprung from the
P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;ava family, he was the son of Janamejaya, and
the grandson of king Par&iacute;kshit, who was the great-grandson of
Abhimanyu. The first progenitor of his race was Arjuna, the might of
whose strong arms was tested in a struggle with the mighty arms of
&#346;iva;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3060src" href="#xd27e3060" name=
"xd27e3060src">2</a> his wife was the earth, and also
Vish&#7751;umat&iacute; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>his queen; the first produced jewels,
but the second did not produce a son. Once on a time, as that king was
roaming about in his passion for the chase, he made acquaintance in the
forest with the hermit &#346;&aacute;ndilya. That worthy sage finding
out that the king desired a son, came to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;
and administered to his queen an artfully prepared oblation<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3065src" href="#xd27e3065" name="xd27e3065src">3</a>
consecrated with mystic verses. Then he had a son born to him called
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka. And his father was adorned by him as
excellence is by modesty. Then in course of time
&#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka made that son crown-prince and though he
still enjoyed kingly pleasures, ceased to trouble himself about the
cares of government. Then a war arose between the gods and Asuras, and
Indra sent M&aacute;tali as a messenger to that king begging for aid.
Then he committed his son and his kingdom to the care of his principal
minister, who was called Yogandhara, and his Commander-in-chief, whose
name was Suprat&iacute;ka, and went to Indra with M&aacute;tali to slay
the Asuras in fight. That king, having slain many Asuras, of whom
Yamadansh&#7789;ra was the chief, under the eyes of Indra, met death in
that very battle. The king&rsquo;s body was brought back by
M&aacute;tali, and the queen burnt herself with it, and the royal
dignity descended to his son Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka. Wonderful to
say, when that king ascended his father&rsquo;s throne, the heads of
the kings on every side of his dominions were bent down with the
weight. Then Indra sent M&aacute;tali, and brought to heaven that
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, as being the son of his friend, that he
might be present at the great feast which he was holding to celebrate
his victory over his foes. There the king saw the gods, attended by
their fair ones, sporting in the garden of Nandana, and desiring for
himself a suitable wife, fell into low spirits. Then Indra, perceiving
this desire of his, said to him; &ldquo;King, away with despondency,
this desire of thine shall be accomplished. For there has been born
upon the earth one, who was long ago ordained a suitable match for
thee. For listen to the following history, which I now proceed to
relate to thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago I went to the court of Brahm&aacute; in order to
visit him, and a certain Vasu named Vidh&uacute;ma followed me. While
we were there, an Apsaras<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3070src" href=
"#xd27e3070" name="xd27e3070src">4</a> named Alambush&aacute; came to
see Brahm&aacute;, and her robe was blown aside by the wind. And the
Vasu, when he beheld her, was overpowered by love, and the Apsaras too
had her eyes immediately attracted by his form. The lotus-sprung
god,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3075src" href="#xd27e3075" name=
"xd27e3075src">5</a> when he beheld that, looked me full in the face,
and I, knowing his meaning, in wrath cursed those two, &lsquo;Be born,
you two, shameless creatures, into the world of mortals, and there
become man and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>wife.&rsquo; That Vasu has been born as thou,
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, the son of &#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka, an
ornament to the race of the moon. And that Apsaras too has been born in
Ayodhy&aacute; as the daughter of king K&#7771;itavarman,
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; by name, she shall be thy wife.&rdquo; By
these words of Indra the flame of love was fanned in the
passionate<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3080src" href="#xd27e3080" name=
"xd27e3080src">6</a> heart of the king and burst out into full blaze;
as a fire when fanned by the wind. Indra then dismissed the king from
heaven with all due honour in his own chariot, and he set out with
M&aacute;tali<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3089src" href="#xd27e3089"
name="xd27e3089src">7</a> for his capital. But as he was starting, the
Apsaras Tilottam&aacute; said to him out of affection, &ldquo;King I
have somewhat to say to thee, wait a moment.&rdquo; But he, thinking on
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;, went off without hearing what she said,
then Tilottam&aacute; in her rage cursed him; &ldquo;King, thou shalt
be separated for fourteen years from her who has so engrossed thy mind
that thou dost not hear my speech.&rdquo; Now M&aacute;tali heard that
curse, but the king, yearning for his beloved, did not. In the chariot
he went to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; but in spirit he went to
Ayodhy&aacute;. Then the king told with longing heart, all that he had
heard from Indra with reference to M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;, to
his ministers, Yogandhara and the others: and not being able to endure
delay, he sent an ambassador to Ayodhy&aacute; to ask her father
K&#7771;itavarman for the hand of that maiden. And K&#7771;itavarman
having heard from the ambassador his commission, told in his joy the
queen Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, and then she said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;King we ought certainly to give
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; to Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, and, I
remember, a certain Br&aacute;hman told me this very thing in a
dream&rdquo;; then in his delight the king showed to the ambassador
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s wonderful skill in dancing,
singing, and other accomplishments, and her matchless beauty; so the
king K&#7771;itavarman gave to Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka that daughter
of his who was unequalled as a mine of graceful arts, and who shone
like an incarnation of the moon; that marriage of
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka and M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; was one in
which the good qualities of either party supplemented those of the
other, and might be compared to the union of learning and
intelligence.</p>
<p>Not long after sons were born to the king&rsquo;s ministers;
Yogandhara had a son born to him named <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>;
and Suprat&iacute;ka had a son born to him named Ruma&#7751;vat. And to
the king&rsquo;s master of the revels was born a son named Vasantaka.
Then in a few days M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; became slightly pale
and promised to bear a child to king Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka. And
then she asked the king, who was never tired of looking at her, to
gratify her longing by filling a tank full of blood for her to bathe
in. Accordingly the king, who was a righteous man, in order to gratify
her desire, had a tank filled with the juice of lac and other red
extracts, so that it seemed to be full of blood.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3097src" href="#xd27e3097" name="xd27e3097src">8</a> And while
she was bathing in that lake, and covered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>with red dye, a bird of
the race of Garu&#7693;a<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3119src" href=
"#xd27e3119" name="xd27e3119src">9</a> suddenly pounced upon her and
carried her off thinking she was raw flesh. As soon as she was carried
away in some unknown direction by the bird, the king became distracted,
and his self-command forsook him as if in order to go in search of her.
His heart was so attached to his beloved that it was in very truth
carried off by that bird, and thus he fell senseless upon the earth. As
soon as he had recovered his senses, M&aacute;tali, who had discovered
all by his divine power, descended through the air and came where the
king was. He consoled the king, and told him the curse of
Tilottam&aacute; with its destined end, as he had heard it long ago,
and then he took his departure. Then the king tormented with grief
lamented on this wise; &ldquo;Alas my beloved, that wicked
Tilottam&aacute; has accomplished her desire.&rdquo; But having learned
the facts about the curse, and having received advice from his
ministers, he managed, though with difficulty, to retain his life
through hope of a future reunion.</p>
<p>But that bird, which had carried off M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;,
as soon as it found out that she was alive, abandoned her, and as fate
would have it, left her on the mountain where the sun rises. And when
the bird let her drop and departed, the queen, distracted with grief
and fear, saw that she was left unprotected on the slope of a trackless
mountain. While she was weeping in the forest, alone, with one garment
only to cover her, an enormous serpent rose up and prepared to swallow
her. Then she, for whom prosperity was reserved in the future, was
delivered by some heavenly hero that came down and slew the serpent,
and disappeared almost as soon as he was seen. Thereupon she, longing
for death, flung herself down in front of a wild elephant, but even he
spared her as if out of compassion. Wonderful was it that even a wild
beast did not slay her when she fell in his way! Or rather it was not
to be wondered at. What cannot the will of &#346;iva effect?</p>
<p>Then the girl tardy with the weight of her womb, desiring to hurl
herself down from a precipice, and thinking upon that lord of hers,
wept aloud; and a hermit&rsquo;s son, who had wandered there in search
of roots and fruits, hearing that, came up, and found her looking like
the incarnation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>of sorrow. And he, after questioning the queen
about her adventures, and comforting her as well as he could, with a
heart melted with compassion led her off to the hermitage of Jamadagni.
There she beheld Jamadagni, looking like the incarnation of comfort,
whose brightness so illumined the eastern mountain that it seemed as if
the rising sun ever rested on it. When she fell at his feet, that
hermit who was kind to all that came to him for help, and possessed
heavenly insight, said to her who was tortured with the pain of
separation; &ldquo;Here there shall be born to thee, my daughter, a son
that shall uphold the family of his father, and thou shalt be reunited
to thy husband, therefore weep not.&rdquo; When that virtuous woman
heard that speech of the hermit&rsquo;s, she took up her abode in that
hermitage, and entertained hope of a reunion with her beloved. And some
days after, the blameless one gave birth to a charmingly beautiful son,
as association with the good produces good manners. At that moment a
voice was heard from heaven; &ldquo;an august king of great renown has
been born, Udayana by name, and his son shall be monarch of all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; That voice restored to the heart of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; joy which she had long forgotten.
Gradually that boy grew up to size and strength in that grove of
asceticism, accompanied by his own excellent qualities as playmates.
And the heroic child had the sacraments appropriate to a member of the
warrior-caste performed for him by Jamadagni, and was instructed by him
in the sciences, and the practice of archery. And out of love for him
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; drew off from her own wrist, and placed
on his, a bracelet marked with the name of Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka.
Then that Udayana roaming about once upon a time in pursuit of deer,
beheld in the forest a snake that had been forcibly captured by a
&#346;avara.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3142src" href="#xd27e3142"
name="xd27e3142src">10</a> And he, feeling pity for the beautiful
snake, said to that &#346;avara, &ldquo;Let go this snake to please
me.&rdquo; Then that &#346;avara said, &ldquo;My lord, this is my
livelihood, for I am a poor man, and I always maintain myself by
exhibiting dancing snakes. The snake I previously had having died, I
searched through this great wood, and, finding this one, overpowered
him by charms and captured him.&rdquo; When he heard this, the generous
Udayana gave that &#346;avara the bracelet which his mother had
bestowed on him, and persuaded him to set the snake at liberty. The
&#346;avara took the bracelet and departed, and then the snake being
pleased with Udayana bowed before him and said as follows, &ldquo;I am
the eldest brother of V&aacute;suki,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3145src" href="#xd27e3145" name="xd27e3145src">11</a> called
Vasunemi: receive from me, whom thou hast preserved, this lute, sweet
in the sounding of its strings, divided according to the division of
the quarter-tones; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56"
name="pb56">56</a>]</span>and betel leaf, together with the art of
weaving unfading garlands, and adorning the forehead with marks that
never become indistinct.&rdquo; Then Udayana furnished with all these,
and dismissed by the snake, returned to the hermitage of Jamadagni,
raining nectar, so to speak, into the eyes of his mother.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that &#346;avara who had lighted on this forest,
and while roaming about in it had obtained the bracelet from Udayana by
the will of fate, was caught attempting to sell this ornament marked
with the king&rsquo;s name in the market, and was arrested by the
police, and brought up in court before the king. Then king
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka himself asked him in sorrow whence he had
obtained the bracelet. Then that &#346;avara told him the whole story
of his obtaining possession of the bracelet, beginning with his capture
of the snake upon the eastern mountain. Hearing that from the
&#346;avara, and beholding that bracelet of his beloved, king
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka ascended the swing of doubt.</p>
<p>Then a divine voice from heaven delighted the king who was tortured
with the fire of separation, as the rain-drops delight the peacock when
afflicted with the heat, uttering these words&mdash;&ldquo;Thy curse is
at an end, O king, and that wife of thine M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;
is residing in the hermitage of Jamadagni together with thy son.&rdquo;
Then that day at last came to an end, though made long by anxious
expectation, and on the morrow that king Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka,
making the &#346;avara show him the way, set out with his army for that
hermitage on the eastern mountain, in order quickly to recover his
beloved wife.</p>

<p class="first">After he had gone a long distance the king encamped
that day in a certain forest on the border of a lake. He went to bed
weary, and in the evening he said to Sangataka a story-teller who had
come to him on account of the pleasure he took in his service;
&ldquo;Tell me some tale that will gladden my heart, for I am longing
for the joy of beholding the lotus-face of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;.&rdquo; Then Sangataka said, King why do
you grieve without cause? The union with your queen, which will mark

<p class="first">Once on a time there lived in the country of
M&aacute;lava a Br&aacute;hman named Yajnasoma. And that good man had
two sons born to him, beloved by men. One of them was known as
K&aacute;lanemi and the second was named <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>Vigatabhaya. Now, when
their father had gone to heaven, those two brothers, having passed
through the age of childhood, went to the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra to acquire learning. And when they had
completed their studies, their teacher Deva&#347;arman gave them his
own two daughters, like another couple of sciences incarnate in bodily
form.</p>
<p>Then seeing that the householders around him were rich,
K&aacute;lanemi through envy made a vow and propitiated the goddess of
Fortune with burnt-offerings. And the goddess being satisfied appeared
in bodily form and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt obtain great
wealth and a son who shall rule the earth; but at last thou shalt be
put to death like a robber, because thou hast offered flesh in the fire
with impure motives.&rdquo; When she had said this, the goddess
disappeared; and K&aacute;lanemi in course of time became very rich;
moreover after some days a son was born to him. So the father, whose
desires were now accomplished, called that son
&#346;r&iacute;datta,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3168src" href=
"#xd27e3168" name="xd27e3168src">1</a> because he had been obtained by
the favour of the goddess of Fortune. In course of time
&#346;r&iacute;datta grew up, and though a Br&aacute;hman, became
matchless upon earth in the use of weapons, and in boxing and
wrestling.</p>
<p>Then K&aacute;lanemi&rsquo;s brother Vigatabhaya went to a foreign
land, having become desirous of visiting places of pilgrimage, through
sorrow for his wife, who died of the bite of a snake.</p>
<p>Moreover the king of the land, Vallabha&#347;akti, who appreciated
good qualities, made &#346;r&iacute;datta the companion of his son
Vikrama&#347;akti. So he had to live with a haughty prince, as the
impetuous Bh&iacute;ma lived in his youth with Duryodhana. Then two
Kshatriyas, natives of Avanti, B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and
Vajramush&#7789;i became friends of that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s. And
some other men from the Deccan, sons of ministers, having been
conquered by him in wrestling, resorted to him out of spontaneous
friendship, as they knew how to value merit. Mah&aacute;bala and
Vy&aacute;ghrabha&#7789;a and also Upendrabala and a man named
Nish&#7789;huraka became his friends. One day, as years rolled on,
&#346;r&iacute;datta, being in attendance on the prince, went with him
and those friends to sport on the bank of the Ganges; then the
prince&rsquo;s own servants made him king, and at the same time
&#346;r&iacute;datta was chosen king by his friends. This made the
prince angry, and in over-weening confidence he at once challenged that
Br&aacute;hman hero to fight. Then being conquered by him in wrestling,
and so disgraced, he made up his mind that this rising hero should be
put to death. But &#346;r&iacute;datta found out that intention of the
prince&rsquo;s, and withdrew in alarm with those friends of his from
his presence. And as he was going along, he saw in the middle of the
Ganges a woman being dragged under by the stream, looking like the
goddess of Fortune in the middle of the sea. And then he plunged in to
pull her out of the water, leaving B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and his
five other friends on the bank. Then that woman, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>though
he seized her by the hair, sank deep in the water; and he dived as deep
in order to follow her. And after he had dived a long way, he suddenly
saw a splendid temple of &#346;iva, but no water and no woman.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3179src" href="#xd27e3179" name="xd27e3179src">2</a>
After beholding that wonderful sight, being wearied out he paid his
adorations to <span class="corr" id="xd27e3182" title=
"Source: the god with the bull-blazoned banner">the god whose emblem is
a bull</span>, and spent that night in a beautiful garden attached to
the temple. And in the morning that lady was seen by him having come to
worship the god &#346;iva, like the incarnate splendour of beauty
attended by all womanly perfections. And after she had worshipped the
god, the moon-faced one departed to her own house, and
&#346;r&iacute;datta for his part followed her. And he saw that palace
of hers resembling the city of the gods, which the haughty beauty
entered hurriedly in a contemptuous manner. And without deigning to
address him, the graceful lady sat down on a sofa in the inner part of
the house, waited upon by thousands of women. And &#346;r&iacute;datta
also took a seat near her; then suddenly that virtuous lady began to
weep. The tear-drops fell in an unceasing shower on her bosom, and that
moment pity entered into the heart of &#346;r&iacute;datta. And then he
said to her, &ldquo;Who art thou, and what is thy sorrow? Tell me, fair
one, for I am able to remove it.&rdquo; Then she said reluctantly,
&ldquo;We are the thousand granddaughters of Bali<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3185src" href="#xd27e3185" name="xd27e3185src">3</a> the king of
the Daityas, and I am the eldest of all, and my name is
Vidyutprabh&aacute;. That grandfather of ours was carried off by
Vish&#7751;u to long imprisonment, and the same hero slew our father in
a wrestling-match. And after he had slain him, he excluded us from our
own city, and he placed a lion in it to prevent us from entering. The
lion occupies that place, and grief our hearts. It is a Yaksha that was
made a lion by the curse of Kuvera, and long ago it was predicted that
the Yaksha&rsquo;s curse should end when he was conquered by some
mortal; so Vish&#7751;u deigned to inform us on our humbly asking him
how we might be enabled to enter our city. Therefore subdue that lion
our enemy; it was for that reason, O hero, that I enticed you hither.
And when you have overcome him you will obtain from him a sword named
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nka, by the virtue of which you shall conquer the
world and become a king.&rdquo; When he heard that,
&#346;r&iacute;datta agreed to undertake the adventure, and after that
day had passed, on the morrow he took those Daitya maidens with him as
guides, and went to that city, and there he overcame in wrestling that
haughty lion.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3188src" href="#xd27e3188"
name="xd27e3188src">4</a> He being freed from his curse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>assumed
a human form, and out of gratitude gave his sword to the man who had
put an end to his curse, and then disappeared together with the burden
of the sorrow of the great Asura&rsquo;s daughter. Then that
&#346;r&iacute;datta, together with the Daitya&rsquo;s daughter, who
was accompanied by her younger sisters, entered that splendid city
which looked like the serpent Ananta<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3200src" href="#xd27e3200" name="xd27e3200src">5</a> having
emerged from the earth. And that Daitya maiden gave him a ring that
destroyed the effect of poison. Then that young man remaining there
fell in love with her. And she cunningly said to him, &ldquo;Bathe in
this tank, and when you dive in, take with you this sword<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3205src" href="#xd27e3205" name="xd27e3205src">6</a>
to keep off the danger of crocodiles.&rdquo; He consented, and diving
into the tank, rose upon that very bank of the Ganges from which he
first plunged in. Then he, seeing the ring and the sword, felt
astonishment at having emerged from the lower regions, and despondency
at having been tricked by the Asura maid. Then he went towards his own
house to look for his friends, and as he was going he saw on the way
his friend Nish&#7789;huraka. Nish&#7789;huraka came up to him and
saluted him, and quickly took him aside into a lonely place, and when
asked by him for news of his relations, gave him this answer; &ldquo;On
that occasion when you plunged into the Ganges we searched for you many
days, and out of grief we were preparing to cut off our heads, but a
voice from heaven forbade that attempt of ours saying, &lsquo;My sons,
do no rash act, your friend shall return alive.&rsquo; And then we were
returning into the presence of your father, when on the way a man
hurriedly advanced to meet us and said this&mdash;&lsquo;You must not
enter this city at present, for the king of it Vallabha&#347;akti is
dead, and the ministers have with one accord conferred the royal
dignity on Vikrama&#347;akti;<span class="corr" id="xd27e3214" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> now the day after he was made king he
went to the house of K&aacute;lanemi, and full of wrath asked him where
his son &#346;r&iacute;datta was, and he replied&mdash;&lsquo;I do not
know.&rsquo; Then the king in a rage, supposing he had concealed his
son, had him put to death by impalement as a thief. When his wife saw
that, her heart broke. Men of cruel deeds must always pile one evil
action upon another in long succession; and so Vikrama&#347;akti is
searching for &#346;r&iacute;datta to slay him, and you are his
friends, therefore leave this place.&rsquo; When the man had given us
this warning, B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and his four companions
being grieved went by common consent to their own home in
Ujjayin&iacute;. And they left me here in concealment, my friend, for
your sake. So come, let us go to that very place to meet our
friends.&rdquo; Having heard this from Nish&#7789;huraka, and having
bewailed his parents, &#346;r&iacute;datta cast many a look at his
sword, as if reposing in that his hope of vengeance; then the hero,
biding his time, set out accompanied by Nish&#7789;huraka for that city
of Ujjayin&iacute; in order to meet his friends. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>And as he was relating to his friend his adventures from the time of
his plunging into the stream, &#346;r&iacute;datta beheld a woman
weeping in the road; when she said, &ldquo;I am a woman going to
Ujjayin&iacute; and I have lost my way,&rdquo; &#346;r&iacute;datta out
of pity made her journey along with him. He and Nish&#7789;huraka,
together with that woman, whom he kept with him out of compassion,
halted that day in a certain deserted town. There he suddenly woke up
in the night and beheld that the woman had slain Nish&#7789;huraka, and
was devouring his flesh with the utmost delight. Then he rose up
drawing his sword M&#7771;ig&aacute;nka, and that woman assumed her own
terrible form, that of a R&aacute;kshas&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3220src" href="#xd27e3220" name="xd27e3220src">7</a> and he
seized that night-wanderer by her hair, to slay her. That moment she
assumed a heavenly shape and said to him, &ldquo;Slay me not, mighty
hero, let me go, I am not a R&aacute;kshas&iacute;; the hermit
Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra imposed this condition on me by a curse. For
once when he was performing austerities from a desire to attain the
position of the god of wealth, I was sent by the god to impede him.
Then finding that I was not able to seduce him with my alluring form,
being abashed, I assumed in order to terrify him a formidable shape.
When he saw this, that hermit laid on me a curse suitable to my
offence, exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Wicked one, become a
R&aacute;kshas&iacute; and slay men.&rsquo; And he appointed that my
curse should end when you took hold of my hair; accordingly I assumed
this detestable condition of a R&aacute;kshas&iacute;, and I have
devoured all the inhabitants of this town: now to-day after a long time
you have brought my curse to an end in the manner foretold; therefore
receive now some boon.&rdquo; When he heard that speech of hers,
&#346;r&iacute;datta said respectfully, &ldquo;Mother grant that my
friend may be restored to life. What need have I of any other
boon?&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said she, and after granting the
boon disappeared. And Nish&#7789;huraka rose up again alive without a
scratch on his body. Then &#346;r&iacute;datta set out the next morning
with him, delighted and astonished, and at last reached
Ujjayin&iacute;. There he revived by his appearance the spirits of his
friends, who were anxiously expecting him, as the arrival of the cloud
revives the peacocks. And after he had told all the wonders of his
adventures, B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin went through the usual
formalities of hospitality, taking him to his own home. There
&#346;r&iacute;datta was taken care of by the parents of
B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin, and lived with his friends as comfortably
as if he were in his own house.</p>
<p>Once on a time, when the great feast of spring-tide<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3228src" href="#xd27e3228" name="xd27e3228src">8</a>
had arrived, he went with his friends to behold some festal rejoicings
in a garden. There he beheld a maiden, the daughter of king Bimbaki,
who had come to see the show, looking like the goddess of the Splendour
of Spring present in bodily form. She, by name
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, that moment penetrated into his
heart, as if through the openings left by the expansion of his eye. Her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>passionate look too, indicative of the beginning
of love, fixed on him, went and returned like a confidante. When she
entered a thicket of trees, &#346;r&iacute;datta not beholding her,
suddenly felt his heart so empty that he did not know where he was. His
friend B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin, who thoroughly understood the
language of gestures, said to him, &ldquo;My friend, I know your heart,
do not deny your passion, therefore, come, let us go to that part of
the garden where the king&rsquo;s daughter is.&rdquo; He consented and
went near her accompanied by his friend. That moment a cry was heard
there, which gave great pain to the heart of &#346;r&iacute;datta,
&ldquo;Alas the princess has been bitten by a snake!&rdquo;
B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin then went and said to the
chamberlain&mdash;&ldquo;My friend here possesses a ring that
counteracts the effects of poison, and also healing spells.&rdquo;
Immediately the chamberlain came, and bowing at his feet, quickly led
&#346;r&iacute;datta to the princess. He placed the ring on her finger,
and then muttered his spells so that she revived. Then all the
attendants were delighted, and loud in praise of &#346;r&iacute;datta,
and the king Bimbaki hearing the circumstances came to the place.
Accordingly &#346;r&iacute;datta returned with his friends to the house
of B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin without taking back the ring. And all
the gold and other presents, which the delighted king sent to him
there, he handed over to the father of B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin.
Then, thinking upon that fair one, he was so much afflicted, that his
friends became utterly bewildered as to what to do with him. Then a
dear friend of the princess, Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute;, by name, came to
him on pretence of returning the ring; and said to him, &ldquo;That
friend of mine, illustrious Sir, has made up her mind, that either you
must save her life by becoming her husband, or she will be married to
her grave.&rdquo; When Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute; had said this,
&#346;r&iacute;datta and B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and the others
quickly put their heads together and came to the following resolution,
&ldquo;We will carry off this princess secretly by a stratagem, and
will go unperceived from here to Mathur&aacute; and live there.&rdquo;
The plan having been thoroughly talked over, and the conspirators
having agreed with one another what each was to do in order to carry it
out, Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute; then departed. And the next day
B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin, accompanied by three of his friends, went
to Mathur&aacute; on pretext of trafficking, and as he went he posted
in concealment at intervals swift horses for the conveyance of the
princess. But &#346;r&iacute;datta then brought at eventide a woman
with her daughter into the palace of the princess, after making them
both drink spirits, and then Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute;, on pretence of
lighting up the palace, set fire to it, and secretly conveyed the
princess out of it; and that moment &#346;r&iacute;datta, who was
remaining outside, received her, and sent her on to
B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin, who had started in the morning, and
directed two of his friends to attend on her and also
Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute;. Now that drunken woman and her daughter were
burnt in the palace of the princess, and people supposed that the
princess had been burnt with her friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>But &#346;r&iacute;datta
took care to show himself in the morning as before, in the city; then
on the second night, taking with him his sword M&#7771;ig&aacute;nka,
he started to follow his beloved, who had set out before him. And in
his eagerness he accomplished a great distance that night, and when the
morning watch<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3238src" href="#xd27e3238"
name="xd27e3238src">9</a> had passed, he reached the Vindhya forest.
There he first beheld unlucky omens, and afterwards he saw all those
friends of his together with Bh&aacute;vanik&aacute; lying in the road
gashed with wounds. And when he came up all distracted, they said to
him, &ldquo;We were robbed to-day by a large troop of horsemen that set
upon us. And after we were reduced to this state, one of the horsemen
threw the terrified princess on his horse and carried her off. So
before she has been carried to a great distance, go in this direction,
do not remain near us, she is certainly of more importance than
we.&rdquo; Being urged on with these words by his friends,
&#346;r&iacute;datta rapidly followed after the princess, but could not
help frequently turning round to look at them. And after he had gone a
considerable distance, he caught up that troop of cavalry, and he saw a
young man of the warrior caste in the midst of it. And he beheld that
princess held by him upon his horse. So he slowly approached that young
warrior; and when soft words would not induce him to let the princess
go, he hurled him from his horse with a blow of his foot, and dashed
him to pieces on a rock. And after he had slain him, he mounted on his
horse and slew a great number of the other horsemen who charged him in
anger. And then those who remained alive, seeing that the might which
the hero displayed was more than human, fled away in terror; and
&#346;r&iacute;datta mounted on the horse with the princess
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; and set out to find those friends of
his. And after he had gone a little way, he and his wife got off the
horse which had been severely wounded in the fight, and soon after it
fell down and died. And then his beloved
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;, exhausted with fear and exertion,
became very thirsty. And leaving her there, he roamed a long distance
hither and thither, and while he was looking for water the sun set.
Then he discovered that, though he had found water, he had lost his
way, and he passed that night in the wood roaming about, moaning aloud
like a Chakrav&aacute;ka.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3241src" href=
"#xd27e3241" name="xd27e3241src">10</a> And in the morning he reached
that place, which was easy to recognise by the carcass of the horse.
And nowhere there did he behold his beloved princess. Then in his
distraction he placed his sword M&#7771;ig&aacute;nka on the ground,
and climbed to the top of a tree, in order to cast his eye in all
directions for her. That very moment a certain &#346;avara chieftain
passed that way; and he came up and took the sword from the foot of the
tree. Beholding that &#346;avara <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>chieftain, &#346;r&iacute;datta
came down from the top of the tree, and in great grief asked him for
news of his beloved. The &#346;avara chieftain said&mdash;&ldquo;Leave
this place and come to my village; I have no doubt she whom you seek
has gone there; and I shall come there and return you this
sword.&rdquo; When the &#346;avara chieftain urged him to go with these
words, &#346;r&iacute;datta, being himself all eagerness, went to that
village with the chief&rsquo;s men. And there those men said to
him,&mdash;&ldquo;Sleep off your fatigue,&rdquo;&mdash;and when he
reached the house of the chief of the village, being tired he went to
sleep in an instant. And when he woke up he saw his two feet fastened
with fetters, like the two efforts he had made in order to obtain his
beloved, which failed to reach their object. Then he remained there
weeping for his darling, who, like the course of destiny, had for a
moment brought him joy, and the next moment blasted his hopes.</p>
<p>One day a serving maid of the name of Mochanik&aacute; came to him
and said,&mdash;Illustrious Sir, unwittingly you have come hither to
your death? For the &#346;avara chieftain has gone somewhither to
accomplish certain weighty affairs, and when he returns, he will offer
you to Cha&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3249src"
href="#xd27e3249" name="xd27e3249src">11</a> For with that object he
decoyed you here by a stratagem from this slope of the wild Vindhya
hill, and immediately threw you into the chains in which you now are.
And it is because you are intended to be offered as a victim to the
goddess, that you are continually served with garments and food. But I
know of only one expedient for delivering you, if you agree to it. This
&#346;avara chieftain has a daughter named Sundar&iacute;, and she
having seen you is becoming exceedingly love-sick; marry her who is my
friend, then you will obtain deliverance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3252src" href="#xd27e3252" name="xd27e3252src">12</a> When she
said this to him, &#346;r&iacute;datta consented, desiring to be set at
liberty, and secretly made that Sundar&iacute; his wife by the
G&aacute;ndharva form of marriage. And every night she removed his
chains and in a short time Sundar&iacute; became pregnant. Then her
mother, having heard the whole story from the mouth of
Mochanik&aacute;, out of love for her son-in-law &#346;r&iacute;datta,
went and of her own accord said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My son,
&#346;r&iacute;cha&#7751;&#7693;a the father of Sundar&iacute; is a
wrathful man, and will show thee no mercy. Therefore depart, but thou
must not forget Sundar&iacute;.&rdquo; When his mother-in-law had said
this, she set him at liberty, and &#346;r&iacute;datta departed after
telling Sundar&iacute; that the sword, which was in her father&rsquo;s
possession, really belonged to himself.</p>
<p>So he again entered full of anxiety that forest, in which he had
before wandered about, in order again to search for traces of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;. And having seen an auspicious omen he
came to that same place, where that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>horse of his died before, and
whence his wife was carried off. And there he saw near<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3259src" href="#xd27e3259" name=
"xd27e3259src">13</a> him a hunter coming towards him, and when he saw
him he asked him for news of that gazelle-eyed lady. Then the hunter
asked him &ldquo;Are you &#346;r&iacute;datta?&rdquo; and he sighing
replied &ldquo;I am that unfortunate man.&rdquo; Then that hunter said,
&ldquo;Listen, friend, I have somewhat to tell you. I saw that wife of
yours wandering hither and thither lamenting your absence, and having
asked her her story, and consoled her, moved with compassion I took her
out of this wood to my own village. But when I saw the young
Pulindas<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3262src" href="#xd27e3262" name=
"xd27e3262src">14</a> there, I was afraid, and I took her to a village
named N&aacute;gasthala near Mathur&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3267src" href="#xd27e3267" name="xd27e3267src">15</a> And then I
placed her in the house of an old Br&aacute;hman named Vi&#347;vadatta
commending her with all due respect to his care. And thence I came here
having learnt your name from her lips. Therefore you had better go
quickly to N&aacute;gasthala to search for her.&rdquo; When the hunter
had told him this, &#346;r&iacute;datta quickly set out, and he reached
N&aacute;gasthala in the evening of the second day. Then he entered the
house of Vi&#347;vadatta and when he saw him said, &ldquo;Give me my
wife who was placed here by the hunter.&rdquo; Vi&#347;vadatta when he
heard that, answered him, &ldquo;I have a friend in Mathur&aacute; a
Br&aacute;hman, dear to all virtuous men, the spiritual preceptor and
minister of the king &#346;&uacute;rasena. In his care I placed your
wife. For this village is an out-of-the-way place and would not afford
her protection. So go to that city to-morrow morning, but to-day rest
here.&rdquo; When Vi&#347;vadatta said this, he spent that night there,
and the next morning he set off, and reached Mathur&aacute; on the
second day. Being weary and dusty with the long journey, he bathed
outside that city in the pellucid water of a lake. And he drew out of
the middle of the lake a garment placed there by some robbers, not
suspecting any harm. But in one corner of the garment, which was
knotted up, a necklace was concealed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3270src" href="#xd27e3270" name="xd27e3270src">16</a> Then
&#346;r&iacute;datta took that garment, and in his eagerness to meet
his wife did not notice the necklace, and so entered the city of
Mathur&aacute;. Then the city police recognized the garment, and
finding the necklace, arrested &#346;r&iacute;datta as a thief, and
carried him off, and brought him before the chief magistrate exactly as
he was found, with the garment in his possession; by him he was handed
up to the king, and the king ordered him to be put to death.</p>
<p>Then, as he was being led off to the place of execution with the
drum being beaten behind him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3275src" href=
"#xd27e3275" name="xd27e3275src">17</a> his wife
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; saw him in the distance. She went in a
state of the utmost distraction and said to the chief minister, in
whose house she was residing, &ldquo;Yonder is my husband being led off
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>to execution.&rdquo; Then that minister went and
ordered the executioners to desist, and, by making a representation to
the king, got &#346;r&iacute;datta pardoned, and had him brought to his
house. And when &#346;r&iacute;datta reached his house, and saw that
minister, he recognised him and fell at his feet, exclaiming,
&ldquo;What! is this my uncle Vigatabhaya, who long ago went to a
foreign country, and do I now by good luck find him established in the
position of a minister?&rdquo; He too recognised to his astonishment
&#346;r&iacute;datta as his brother&rsquo;s son, and embraced him, and
questioned him about all his adventures. Then &#346;r&iacute;datta
related to his uncle his whole history beginning with the execution of
his father. And he, after weeping, said to his nephew in private,
&ldquo;Do not despond, my son, for I once brought a female Yaksha into
subjection by means of magic; and she gave me, though I have no son,
five thousand horses and seventy millions of gold pieces: and all that
wealth is at your disposal.&rdquo; After telling him this, his uncle
brought him his beloved, and he, having obtained wealth, married her on
the spot. And then he remained there in joy, united with that beloved
M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute; as a bed of white lotuses<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3280src" href="#xd27e3280" name=
"xd27e3280src">18</a> with the night. But even when his happiness was
at its full, anxiety for B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and his
companions clouded his heart, as a spot of darkness does the full moon.
Now one day his uncle said secretly to &#346;r&iacute;datta: &ldquo;my
son, the king &#346;&uacute;rasena has a maiden daughter, and in
accordance with his orders I have to take her to the land of Avanti to
give her away in marriage; so I will take her away on that very
pretext, and marry her to you. Then, when you have got possession of
the force that follows her, with mine already at your disposal, you
will soon gain the kingdom that was promised you by the goddess
&#346;r&iacute;.&rdquo; Having resolved on this, and having taken that
maiden, &#346;r&iacute;datta and his uncle set out with their army and
their attendants. But as soon as they had reached the Vindhya forest,
before they were aware of the danger, a large army of brigands set upon
them showering arrows. After routing &#346;r&iacute;datta&rsquo;s
force, and seizing all the wealth, they bound &#346;r&iacute;datta
himself, who had fainted from his wounds, and carried him off to their
village. And they took him to the awful temple of Durg&aacute;, in
order to offer him up in sacrifice, and, as it were, summoned Death
with the sound of their gongs. There Sundar&iacute; saw him, one of his
wives, the daughter of the chief of the village, who had come with her
young son to visit the shrine of the goddess. Full of joy she ordered
the brigands, who were between her and her husband, to stand aside, and
then &#346;r&iacute;datta entered her palace with her. Immediately
&#346;r&iacute;datta obtained the sovereignty of that village, which
Sundar&iacute;&rsquo;s father, having no son, bequeathed to her when he
went to heaven. So &#346;r&iacute;datta recovered his wife and his
sword M&#7771;ig&aacute;nka, and also his uncle and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>his
followers, who had been overpowered by the robbers. And, while he was
in that town, he married the daughter of &#346;&uacute;rasena, and
became a great king there. And from that place he sent ambassadors to
his two fathers-in-law, to Bimbaki, and king &#346;&uacute;rasena. And
they, being very fond of their daughters, gladly recognised him as a
connection, and came to him accompanied by the whole of their armies.
And his friends B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin and the others, who had
been separated from him, when they heard what had happened, came to him
with their wounds healed and in good health. Then the hero marched,
united with his fathers-in-law, and made that Vikrama&#347;akti, who
had put his father to death, a burnt-offering in the flame of his
wrath. And then &#346;r&iacute;datta, having gained dominion over the
sea-encircled earth, and deliverance from the sorrow of separation,
joyed in the society of M&#7771;ig&aacute;nkavat&iacute;. Even so, my
king, do men of firm resolution cross the calamitous sea of separation
and obtain prosperity.</p>
<p>After hearing this tale from Sangataka, the king
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, though longing for the sight of his beloved
one, managed to get through that night on the journey. Then, engrossed
with his desire, sending his thoughts on before, in the morning
Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka set out to meet his darling. And in a few
days he reached that peaceful hermitage of Jamadagni, in which even the
deer laid aside their wantonness. And there he beheld with reverence
that Jamadagni, the sight of whom was sanctifying, like the incarnate
form of penance, who received him hospitably. And the hermit handed
over to him that queen M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; with her son,
regained by the king after long separation, like tranquillity
accompanied with joy. And that sight which the husband and wife
obtained of one another, now that the curse had ceased, rained, as it
were, nectar into their eyes, which were filled with tears of joy. And
the king embracing that son Udayana, whom he now beheld for the first
time, could with difficulty let him go, as he was, so to speak, riveted
to his body with his own hairs that stood erect from joy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3290src" href="#xd27e3290" name=
"xd27e3290src">19</a> Then king Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka took his
queen M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; with Udayana, and, bidding adieu to
Jamadagni, set out from that tranquil hermitage for his own city, and
even the deer followed him as far as the border of the hermitage with
tearful eyes. Beguiling the way by listening to the adventures of his
beloved wife during the period of separation, and by relating his own,
he at length reached the city of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, in which
triumphal arches were erected and banners displayed. And he entered
that city in company with his wife and child, being, so to speak,
devoured<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3293src" href="#xd27e3293" name=
"xd27e3293src">20</a> by the eyes of the citizens, that had the fringe
of their lashes elevated. And immediately the king appointed his son
Udayana crown-prince, being incited to it by his excellent qualities.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>And he assigned to him as advisers the sons of his
own ministers, Vasantaka and Ruma&#7751;vat and
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a. Then a rain of flowers fell, and a
celestial voice was heard&mdash;&ldquo;By the help of these excellent
ministers, the prince shall obtain dominion over the whole
earth.&rdquo; Then the king devolved on his son the cares of empire,
and enjoyed in the society of M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; the
long-desired pleasures of the world. At last the desire of earthly
enjoyment, beholding suddenly that old age, the harbinger of composure
had reached the root of the king&rsquo;s ear,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Then Udayana took the kingdom of Vatsa, which his
father had bequeathed to him, and, establishing himself in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, ruled his subjects well. But gradually he
began to devolve the cares of empire upon his ministers, <span class=
"corr" title=

and others, and gave himself up entirely to pleasures. He was
continually engaged in the chase, and day and night he played on the
melodious lute which V&aacute;suki<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3323src"
href="#xd27e3323" name="xd27e3323src">1</a> gave him long ago; and he
subdued evermore infuriated wild elephants, overpowered by the
fascinating spell of its strings&rsquo; dulcet sound, and, taming them,
brought them home. That king of Vatsa drank wine adorned by the
reflection of the moon-faces of fair women, and at the same time robbed
his minister&rsquo;s faces of their cheerful hue.<a class="noteref" id=

be obtained?&rdquo; Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena also in
Ujjayin&iacute; thought; &ldquo;There is no suitable husband to be
found for my daughter in the world, except one Udayana by name, and he
has ever been my enemy. Then how can I make him my <span class=

one device which can effect it. He wanders about alone in the forest
capturing elephants, for he is a king addicted to the vice of hunting;
I will make use of this failing of his to entrap him and bring him here
by a stratagem: and, as he is acquainted with music, I will make this
daughter of mine his pupil, and then his eye will without doubt be
charmed with her, and he will certainly became my son-in-law, and my
obedient ally. No other artifice seems applicable in this case for
making him submissive to my will.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, he went
to the temple of Durg&aacute;, in order that his scheme might be
blessed with success, and, after worship and praise, offered a prayer
to the goddess. And there he heard a bodiless voice saying, &ldquo;This
desire of thine, O king, shall shortly be accomplished.&rdquo; Then he
returned satisfied, and deliberated over that very matter with the
minister Buddhadatta<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3336src" href=
"#xd27e3336" name="xd27e3336src">3</a> saying&mdash;&ldquo;That prince
is elated with pride, he is free from avarice, his subjects are

pupil in music, if thou love us, come here and teach
her.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When sent off by the king with this message,
the ambassador went and repeated it to the king of Vatsa in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; exactly as it was delivered; and the king
of Vatsa, after hearing this uncourteous message from the ambassador,
repeated it in private to the minister <span class="corr" title=

saying &ldquo;Why did that monarch send me that insolent message? What

When the king asked him this question, the great minister <span class=

king Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena, thinking that you are the slave
of your passions, intends to ensnare you by means of his beautiful
daughter, throw you into prison, and so make you his unresisting
instrument. Therefore abandon kingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

fall into them are easily captured by their enemies, even as elephants
are taken in pits.&rdquo; When his minister had said this to him, the
resolute king of Vatsa sent in return an ambassador to
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena with the following reply, &ldquo;If
thy daughter desires to become my pupil, then send her here.&rdquo;
When he had sent this reply, that king of Vatsa said to his
ministers&mdash;&ldquo;I will march and bring
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena here in chains.&rdquo; When he heard
that, the head minister <span class="corr" title=

said&mdash;&ldquo;That is not a fitting thing to do, my king, nor is it

<p class="first">There is in this land a city named Ujjayin&iacute;,
the ornament of the earth, that, so to speak, laughs to scorn with its
palaces of enamelled whiteness<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3386src"
href="#xd27e3386" name="xd27e3386src">6</a> Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;,
the city of the gods. In that city dwells &#346;iva himself, the lord
of existence, under the form of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3391src" href="#xd27e3391" name="xd27e3391src">7</a>
when he desists from the kingly vice of absenting himself on the
heights of mount Kail&aacute;sa. In that city lived a king named
Mahendravarman, best of monarchs, and he had a son like himself, named
Jayasena. Then to that Jayasena was born a son named Mah&aacute;sena,
matchless in strength of arm, an elephant among monarchs. And that
king, while cherishing his realm, reflected, &ldquo;I have not a sword
worthy of me,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3400src" href="#xd27e3400"
name="xd27e3400src">8</a> nor a wife of good family.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting that monarch went to the temple of Durg&aacute;, and there
he remained without food, propitiating for a long time the goddess.
Then he cut off pieces of his own flesh, and offered a burnt-offering
with them, whereupon the goddess Durg&aacute; being pleased appeared in
visible shape and said to him, &ldquo;I am pleased with thee, receive
from me this excellent sword, by means of its magic power thou shalt be
invincible to all thy enemies. Moreover thou shalt soon obtain as a
wife Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute;, the daughter of the Asura
Ang&aacute;raka, the most beautiful maiden in the three worlds. And
since thou didst here perform this very cruel penance, therefore thy
name shall be Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena.&rdquo; Having said
this and given him the sword, the goddess disappeared. But in the king
there appeared joy at the fulfilment of his desire. He now possessed, O
king, two jewels, his sword and a furious elephant named
Na&#7693;&aacute;giri, which were to him what the thunderbolt and
Air&aacute;va&#7751;a are to Indra. Then that king, delighting in the
power of these two, one day went to a great forest to hunt; and there
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>beheld an enormous and terrible wild boar; like
the darkness of the night suddenly condensed into a solid mass in the
day time. That boar was not wounded by the king&rsquo;s arrows, in
spite of their sharpness, but after breaking the king&rsquo;s
chariot<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3408src" href="#xd27e3408" name=
"xd27e3408src">9</a> fled and entered a cavern. The king, leaving that
car of his, in revengeful pursuit of the boar, entered into that cavern
with only his bow to aid him. And after he had gone a long distance, he
beheld a great and splendid capital, and astonished he sat down inside
the city on the bank of a lake. While there, he beheld a maiden moving
along, surrounded by hundreds of women, like the arrow of love that
cleaves the armour of self-restraint. She slowly approached the king,
bathing him, so to speak, again and again in a look, that rained in
showers the nectar of love.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3424src" href=
"#xd27e3424" name="xd27e3424src">10</a> She said, &ldquo;who art thou,
illustrious sir, and for what reason hast thou entered our home on this
occasion?&rdquo; The king, being thus questioned by her, told her the
whole truth; hearing which, she let fall from her eyes a passionate
flood of tears, and from her heart all self-control. The king said,
&ldquo;Who art thou, and why dost thou weep?&rdquo; When he asked her
this question, she, being a prisoner to love at his will, answered him,
&ldquo;The boar that entered here is the Daitya Ang&aacute;raka by
name. And I am his daughter, O king, and my name is
Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute;. And he is of adamantine frame, and has
carried off these hundred princesses from the palaces of kings and
appointed them to attend on me. Moreover this great Asura has become a
R&aacute;kshasa owing to a curse, but to-day as he was exhausted with
thirst and fatigue, even when he found you, he spared you. At present
he has put off the form of a boar and is resting in his own proper
shape, but when he wakes up from his sleep, he will without fail do you
an injury. It is for this reason that I see no hope of a happy issue
for you, and so these tear-drops fall from my eyes like my vital
spirits boiled with the fire of grief.&rdquo; When he heard this speech
of Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute;&rsquo;s the king said to
her,&mdash;&ldquo;If you love me, do this which I ask you. When your
father awakes, go and weep in front of him, and then he will certainly
ask you the cause of your agitation; then you must say&mdash;If some
one were to slay thee, what would become of me?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3429src" href="#xd27e3429" name="xd27e3429src">11</a> This is the
cause of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>my grief. If you do this, there will be a happy
issue both for you and me.&rdquo; When the king said this to her, she
promised him that she would do what he wished. And that Asura maiden,
apprehending misfortune, placed the king in concealment, and went near
her sleeping father. Then the Daitya woke up, and she began to weep.
And then he said to her, &ldquo;Why do you weep, my daughter?&rdquo;
She with affected grief said to him, &ldquo;If some one were to slay
thee, what would become of me?&rdquo; Then he burst out laughing and
said;&mdash;&ldquo;Who could possibly slay me, my daughter, for I am
cased in adamant all over, only in my left hand is there an unguarded
place, but that is protected by the bow.&rdquo; In these words the
Daitya consoled his daughter, and all this was heard by the king in his
concealment. Immediately afterwards the D&aacute;nava rose up and took
his bath, and proceeded in devout silence to worship the god &#346;iva;
at that moment the king appeared with his bow bent, and rushing up
impetuously towards the Daitya, challenged him to fight. He, without
interrupting his devout silence, lifted his left hand towards the king
and made a sign that he must wait for a moment. The king for his part,
being very quick of hand, immediately smote him with an arrow in that
hand which was his vital part. And that great Asura Ang&aacute;raka,
being pierced in a vital spot, immediately uttered a terrible cry and
fell on the ground, and exclaimed, as his life
departed,&mdash;&ldquo;If that man, who has slain me when thirsty, does
not offer water to my manes every year, then his five ministers shall
perish.&rdquo; After he had said this, that Daitya died, and the king,
taking his daughter Ang&aacute;ravat&iacute; as a prize, returned to
Ujjayin&iacute;. There the king Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena
married that Daitya maiden, and two sons were born to him, the first
named Gop&aacute;laka, and the second P&aacute;laka; and when they were
born, he held a feast in honour of Indra on their account. Then Indra,
being pleased, said to that king in a dream, &ldquo;By my favour thou
shalt obtain a matchless daughter.&rdquo; Then in course of time a
graceful daughter was born to that king, like a second and more
wonderful shape of the moon made by the Creator. And on that occasion a
voice was heard from heaven;&mdash;&ldquo;She shall give birth to a
son, who shall be a very incarnation of the god of love, and king of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; Then the king gave that daughter the
name of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, because she was given by Indra being
pleased with him. And that maiden still remains unmarried in the house
of her father, like the goddess of prosperity in the hollow cavity of
the ocean before it was churned. That king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena cannot indeed be conquered by you, O
king, in the first place because he is so powerful, and in the next
place because his realm is situated in a difficult country. Moreover he
is ever longing to give you that daughter of his in marriage, but being
a proud monarch, he desires the triumph of himself and his adherents.
But, I think, you must certainly marry that V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.
When he heard this, that king of Vatsa immediately lost his heart to
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=

<p class="first">In the meanwhile the ambassador, sent by the king of
Vatsa in answer to Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena&rsquo;s embassy,
went and told that monarch his master&rsquo;s reply.
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena for his part, on hearing it, began to
reflect&mdash;&ldquo;It is certain that that proud king of Vatsa will
not come here. And I cannot send my daughter to his court, such conduct
would be unbecoming; so I must capture him by some stratagem and bring
him here as a prisoner.&rdquo; Having thus reflected and deliberated
with his ministers, the king had made a large artificial elephant like
his own, and, after filling it with concealed warriors, he placed it in
the Vindhya forest. There the scouts kept in his pay by the king of
Vatsa, who was passionately fond of the sport of elephant-catching,
discerned it from a distance;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3465src" href=
"#xd27e3465" name="xd27e3465src">1</a> and they came with speed and
informed the king of Vatsa in these words: &ldquo;O king, we have seen
a single elephant roaming in the Vindhya forest, such that nowhere else
in this wide world is his equal to be found, filling the sky with his
stature, like a moving peak of the Vindhya range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king rejoiced on hearing this report from the scouts, and
he gave them a hundred thousand gold pieces by way of reward. The king
spent that night in thinking; &ldquo;If I obtain that mighty elephant,
a fit match for Na&#7693;&aacute;giri, then that
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena will certainly be in my power, and
then he will of his own accord give me his daughter
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.&rdquo; So in the morning he started for the
Vindhya forest, making these scouts shew him the way, disregarding, in
his ardent desire to capture the elephant, the advice of his ministers.
He did not pay any attention to the fact, that the astrologers said,
that the position of the heavenly bodies at the moment of his departure
portended the acquisition of a maiden together with imprisonment. When
the king of Vatsa reached the Vindhya forest, he made his troops halt
at a distance through fear of alarming that elephant, and accompanied
by the scouts only, holding in his hand his melodious lute, he entered
that great forest boundless as his own kingly vice. The king saw on the
southern slope of the Vindhya range that elephant looking like a real
one, pointed out to him by his scouts from a distance. He slowly
approached it, alone, playing on his lute, thinking how he should bind
it, and singing in melodious tones. As his mind was fixed on his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>music, and the shades of evening were setting in,
that king did not perceive that the supposed wild elephant was an
artificial one. The elephant too for its part, lifting up its ears and
flapping them, as if through delight in the music, kept advancing and
then retiring, and so drew the king to a great distance. And then,
suddenly issuing from that artificial elephant, a body of soldiers in
full armour surrounded that king of Vatsa. When he beheld them, the
king in a rage drew his hunting knife, but while he was fighting with
those in front of him, he was seized by others coming up behind. And
those warriors with the help of others, who appeared at a concerted
signal, carried that king of Vatsa into the presence of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena. Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena
for his part came out to meet him with the utmost respect, and entered
with him the city of Ujjayin&iacute;. Then the newly arrived king of
Vatsa was beheld by the citizens, like the moon, pleasing to the eyes,
though spotted with humiliation. Then all the citizens, suspecting that
he was to be put to death, through regard for his virtues assembled and
determined to commit suicide.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3472src" href=
"#xd27e3472" name="xd27e3472src">2</a> Then the king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena put a stop to the agitation of the
citizens, by informing them that he did not intend to put the monarch
of Vatsa to death, but to win him over. So the king made over his
daughter V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; on the spot to the king of Vatsa, to
be taught music, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, teach this lady
music; in this way you will obtain a happy issue to your adventure, do
not despond.&rdquo; But when he beheld that fair lady, the mind of the
king of Vatsa was so steeped in love that he put out of sight his
anger: and her heart and mind turned towards him together; her eye was
then averted through modesty, but her mind not at all. So the king of
Vatsa dwelt in the concert-room of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena&rsquo;s palace, teaching
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; to sing, with his eyes ever fixed on her. In
his lap was his lute, in his throat the quarter-tone of vocal music,
and in front of him stood V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; delighting his
heart. And that princess V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; was devoted in her
attentions to him, resembling the goddess of Fortune in that she was
firmly attached to him, and did not leave him though he was a
captive.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the men who had accompanied the king returned to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, and the country, hearing of the captivity
of the monarch, was thrown into a state of great excitement. Then the
enraged subjects, out of love for the king of Vatsa, wanted to make a
general<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3479src" href="#xd27e3479" name=
"xd27e3479src">3</a> assault on Ujjayin&iacute;. But Ruma&#7751;vat
checked the impetuous fury of the subjects by telling them that
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena was not to be overcome by force, for
he was a mighty monarch, and besides that an assault was not advisable,
for it might endanger the safety of the king of Vatsa; but their object
must be attained by policy. Then the calm and resolute
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, seeing that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>country
was loyal, and would not swerve from its allegiance, said to
Ruma&#7751;vat and the others; &ldquo;All of you must remain here, ever
on the alert; you must guard this country, and when a fit occasion
comes you must display your prowess; but I will go accompanied by
Vasantaka only, and will without fail accomplish by my wisdom the
deliverance of the king and bring him home. For he is a truly firm and
resolute man whose wisdom shines forth in adversity, as the lightning
flash is especially brilliant during pelting rain. I know spells for
breaking through walls, and for rending fetters, and receipts for
becoming invisible, serviceable at need.&rdquo; Having said this, and
entrusted to Ruma&#7751;vat the care of the subjects, <span class=
"corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
set out from Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; with Vasantaka. And with him
he entered the Vindhya forest, full of life<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3490src" href="#xd27e3490" name="xd27e3490src">4</a> like his
wisdom, intricate and trackless as his policy. Then he visited the
palace of the king of the Pulindas, Pulindaka by name, who dwelt on a
peak of the Vindhya range, and was an ally of the king of Vatsa. He
first placed him, with a large force at his heels, in readiness to
protect the king of Vatsa when he returned that way, and then he went
on accompanied by Vasantaka and at last arrived at the burning-ground
of Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la in Ujjayin&iacute;, which was densely
tenanted by vampires<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3495src" href=
"#xd27e3495" name="xd27e3495src">5</a> that smelt of carrion, and
hovered hither and thither, black as night, rivalling the smoke-wreaths
of the funeral pyres. And there a Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa of the
name of Yoge&#347;vara immediately came up to him, delighted to see
him, and admitted him into his friendship; then <span class="corr"
title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span> by
means of a charm, which he taught him, suddenly altered his shape. That
charm immediately made him deformed, hunchbacked, and old, and besides
gave him the appearance of a madman, so that he produced loud laughter
in those who beheld him. And in the same way
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, by means of that very charm, gave
Vasantaka a body full of outstanding veins, with a large stomach, and
an ugly mouth with projecting teeth;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3504src" href="#xd27e3504" name="xd27e3504src">6</a> then he sent
Vasantaka on in front to the gate of the king&rsquo;s palace, and
entered Ujjayin&iacute; with such an appearance as I have described.
There he, singing and dancing, surrounded by Br&aacute;hman boys,
beheld with curiosity by all, made his way to the king&rsquo;s palace.
And there he excited by that behaviour the curiosity of the
king&rsquo;s wives, and was at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>last heard of by
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. She quickly sent a maid and had him brought
to the concert-room. For youth is twin-brother to mirth. And when
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a came there and beheld the king of Vatsa in
fetters, though he had assumed the appearance of a madman, he could not
help shedding tears. And he made a sign to the king of Vatsa, who
quickly recognized him, though he had come in disguise. Then
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a by means of his magic power made himself
invisible to V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and her maids. So the king alone
saw him, and they all said with astonishment, &ldquo;that maniac has
suddenly escaped somewhere or other.&rdquo; Then the king of Vatsa
hearing them say that, and seeing Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a in front
of him, understood that this was due to magic, and cunningly said to
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;; &ldquo;Go my good girl, and bring the
requisites for the worship of Sarasvat&iacute;.&rdquo; When she heard
that, she said, &ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; and went out with her
companions. Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a approached the king and
communicated to him, according to the prescribed form, spells for
breaking chains; and at the same time he furnished him with other
charms for winning the heart of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, which were
attached to the strings of the lute; and informed him that Vasantaka
had come there and was standing outside the door in a changed form, and
recommended him to have that Br&aacute;hman summoned to him; at the
same time he said&mdash;&ldquo;When this lady V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
shall come to repose confidence in you, then you must do what I tell
you, at the present remain quiet.&rdquo; Having said this,
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a quickly went out, and immediately
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; entered with the requisites for the worship
of Sarasvat&iacute;. Then the king said to her, &ldquo;There is a
Br&aacute;hman standing outside the door, let him be brought in to
celebrate this ceremony in honour of Sarasvat&iacute;, in order that he
may obtain a sacrificial fee.&rdquo; V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
consented, and had Vasantaka, who wore a deformed shape, summoned from
the door into the music-hall. And when he was brought and saw the king
of Vatsa, he wept for sorrow, and then the king said to him, in order
that the secret might not be discovered, &ldquo;O Br&aacute;hman, I
will remove all this deformity of thine produced by sickness; do not
weep, remain here near me.&rdquo; And then Vasantaka
said&mdash;&ldquo;It is a great condescension on thy part, O
king.&rdquo; And the king seeing how he was deformed could not keep his
countenance. And when he saw that, Vasantaka guessed what was in the
king&rsquo;s mind, and laughed so that the deformity of his distorted
face was increased; and thereupon V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, beholding
him grinning like a doll, burst out laughing also, and was much
delighted; then the young lady asked Vasantaka in fun the following
question: &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, what science are you familiar with,
tell us?&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Princess, I am an adept at telling
tales.&rdquo; Then she said<span class="corr" id="xd27e3515" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Come, tell me a tale.&rdquo; Then in
order to please that princess, Vasantaka told the following tale, which
was charming by its comic humour and variety. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this country a city named Mathur&aacute;,
the birthplace of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, in it there was a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> known by the name of R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;;
she had for a mother an old <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> named
Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute;, who seemed a lump of poison in the eyes of
the young men attracted by her daughter&rsquo;s charms. One day
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; went at the time of worship to the temple
to perform her duty,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3531src" href=
"#xd27e3531" name="xd27e3531src">7</a> and beheld from a distance a
young man. When she saw that handsome young fellow, he made such an
impression upon her heart, that all her mother&rsquo;s instructions
vanished from it. Then she said to her maid, &ldquo;Go and tell this
man from me, that he is to come to my house to-day.&rdquo; The maid
said, &ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; and immediately went and told him. Then
the man thought a little and said to her; &ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman
named Lohajangha<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3534src" href="#xd27e3534"
name="xd27e3534src">8</a>; I have no wealth; then what business have I
in the house of R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; which is only to be
entered by the rich.&rdquo; The maid said,&mdash;&ldquo;My mistress
does not desire wealth from you,&rdquo;&mdash;whereupon Lohajangha
consented to do as she wished. When she heard that from the maid,
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; went home in a state of excitement, and
remained with her eyes fixed on the path by which he would come. And
soon Lohajangha came to her house, while the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute; looked at
him, and wondered where he came from. R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;, for
her part, when she saw him, rose up to meet him herself with the utmost
respect, and clinging to his neck in her joy, led him to her own
private apartments. Then she was captivated with Lohajangha&rsquo;s
wealth of accomplishments, and considered that she had been only born
to love him. So she avoided the society of other men, and that young
fellow lived with her in her house in great comfort.
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;&rsquo;s mother,
Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute;, who had trained up many
<i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i>, was annoyed when she saw this, and said to
her in private; &ldquo;My daughter, why do you associate with a poor
man? <i>Het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> of good taste embrace a corpse in
preference to a poor man. What business has a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> like
you with affection? How have you come to forget that great principle?

"#xd27e3550" name="xd27e3550src">9</a> sunset lasts but a short time,
and so does the splendour of a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> who gives way to
affection. A <i>het&aelig;ra</i>, like an actress, should exhibit an
assumed affection in order to get wealth; so forsake this pauper, do
not ruin yourself.&rdquo; When she heard this speech of her
mother&rsquo;s, R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; said in a rage, &ldquo;Do
not talk in this way, for I love him more than my life. And as for
wealth, I have plenty, what do I want with more? So you must not speak
to me again, mother, in this way.&rdquo; When she heard this,
Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute; was in a rage, and she remained thinking
over some device for getting rid of this Lohajangha. Then she saw
coming along the road a certain R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, who had spent all
his wealth, surrounded by retainers with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>swords in their hands. So
she went up to him quickly and taking him aside, said&mdash;&ldquo;My
house is beset by a certain poor lover. So come there yourself to-day,
and take such order with him that he shall depart from my house, and do
you possess my daughter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, and entered that house. At that precise moment
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; was in the temple, and Lohajangha
meanwhile was absent somewhere, and suspecting nothing, he returned to
the house a moment afterwards. Immediately the retainers of the
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t ran upon him, and gave him severe kicks and blows
on all his limbs, and then they threw him into a ditch full of all
kinds of impurities, and Lohajangha with difficulty escaped from it.
Then R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; returned to the house, and when she
heard what had taken place, she was distracted with grief, so the
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, seeing that, returned as he came.</p>
<p>Lohajangha, after suffering this brutal outrage by the machinations
of the <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, set out for some holy place
of pilgrimage, in order to leave his life there, now that he was
separated from his beloved. As he was going along in the wild
country,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3569src" href="#xd27e3569" name=
"xd27e3569src">10</a> with his heart burning with anger against the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, and his skin with the heat of the
summer, he longed for shade. Not being able to find a tree, he lighted
on the body of an elephant, which had been stripped of all its
flesh<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3577src" href="#xd27e3577" name=
"xd27e3577src">11</a> by jackals making their way into it by the
hind-quarters; accordingly Lohajangha being worn out crept into this
carcase, which was a mere shell, as only the skin remained, and went to
sleep in it, as it was kept cool by the breeze which freely entered.
Then suddenly clouds arose from all sides, and began to pour down a
pelting shower of rain; that rain made the elephant&rsquo;s skin
contract so that no aperture was left, and immediately a copious
inundation came that way, and carrying off the elephant&rsquo;s hide
swept it into the Ganges; so eventually the inundation bore it into the
sea. And there a bird of the race of Garu&#7693;a saw that hide, and
supposing it to be carrion, took it to the other side of the sea; there
it tore open the elephant&rsquo;s hide with its claws, and, seeing that
there was a man inside it, fled away. But Lohajangha was awaked by the
bird&rsquo;s pecking and scratching, and came out through the aperture
made by its beak. And finding that he was on the other side of the sea,
he was astonished, and looked upon the whole thing as a day-dream; then
he saw there to his terror two horrible R&aacute;kshasas, and those two
for their part contemplated him from a distance with feelings of fear.
Remembering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>how they were defeated by R&aacute;ma, and seeing
that Lohajangha was also a man who had crossed the sea, they were once
more alarmed in their hearts. So, after they had deliberated together,
one of them went off immediately and told the whole occurrence to king
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a; king Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a too, as he had
seen the prowess of R&aacute;ma, being terrified at the arrival of a
man, said to that R&aacute;kshasa; &ldquo;Go, my good friend, and tell
that man from me in a friendly manner, that he is to do me the favour
of coming to my palace.&rdquo; The R&aacute;kshasa said, &ldquo;I will
do so,&rdquo; and timidly approached Lohajangha, and told him that
request of his sovereign&rsquo;s. Lohajangha for his part accepted that
invitation with unruffled calm, and went to Lank&aacute; with that
R&aacute;kshasa and his companion. And when he arrived in Lank&aacute;,
he was astonished at beholding numerous splendid edifices of gold, and
entering the king&rsquo;s palace, he saw Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a. The
king welcomed the Br&aacute;hman who blessed him in return, and then
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a said, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, how did you manage
to reach this country?&rdquo; Then the cunning Lohajangha said to
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a&mdash;&ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman of the name
of Lohajangha residing in Mathur&aacute;; and I, Lohajangha being
afflicted at my poverty, went to the temple of the god, and remaining
fasting, for a long time performed austerities in the presence of
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a.<a class="noteref" id="n90src" href="#n90"
name="n90src">12</a> Then the adorable Hari<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n90">12</a> commanded me in a dream, saying, &lsquo;Go thou to
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a, for he is a faithful worshipper of mine, and
he will give thee wealth.&rsquo; Then, I said,
&lsquo;Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a is where I cannot reach
him&rsquo;&mdash;but the lord continued, &lsquo;To-day shalt thou see
that Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a.&rsquo; So the lord spake to me, and
immediately I woke up and found myself upon this side of the sea. I
know no more.&rdquo; When Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a heard this from
Lohajangha, reflecting that Lank&aacute; was a difficult place to
reach, he thought to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Of a truth this man possesses
divine power.&rdquo; And he said to that
Br&aacute;hman,&mdash;&ldquo;Remain here, I will give you
wealth.&rdquo; Then he committed him to the care of the man-slaying
R&aacute;kshasas as an inviolable deposit; and sent some of his
subjects to a mountain in his kingdom called Swar&#7751;am&uacute;la,
and brought from it a young bird belonging to the race of Garu&#7693;a;
and he gave it to that Lohajangha, (who had to take a long journey to
Mathur&aacute;,) to ride upon, in order that he might in the meanwhile
break it in. Lohajangha for his part mounted on its back, and riding
about on it in Lank&aacute;, rested there for some time, being
hospitably entertained by Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a.</p>
<p>One day he asked the king of the R&aacute;kshasas, feeling curiosity
on the point, why the whole ground of Lank&aacute; was made of wood;
and Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a when he heard that, explained the
circumstance to him, saying, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, if you take any
interest in this matter, listen, I will explain it to you. Long ago
Garu&#7693;a the son of Ka&#347;yapa, wishing to redeem his mother from
her slavery to the snakes, to whom she had been subjected in accordance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>with an agreement,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3618src" href="#xd27e3618" name="xd27e3618src">13</a> and
preparing to obtain from the gods the nectar which was the price of her
ransom, wanted to eat something which would increase his strength, and
so he went to his father, who being importuned said to him, &ldquo;My
son, in the sea there is a huge elephant, and a huge tortoise. They
have assumed their present forms in consequence of a curse: go and eat
them.&rdquo; Then Garu&#7693;a went and brought them both to eat, and
then perched on a bough of the great wishing-tree of paradise. And when
that bough suddenly broke with his weight, he held it up with his beak,
out of regard to the B&aacute;lakhilyas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3621src" href="#xd27e3621" name="xd27e3621src">14</a> who were
engaged in austerities underneath it. Then Garu&#7693;a, afraid that
the bough would crush mankind, if he let it fall at random, by the
advice of his father brought the bough to this uninhabited part of the
earth, and let it drop. Lank&aacute; was built on the top of that
bough, therefore the ground here is of wood.&rdquo; When he heard this
from Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a, Lohajangha was perfectly satisfied.</p>
<p>Then Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a gave to Lohajangha many valuable
jewels, as he desired to set out for Mathur&aacute;. And out of his
devotion to the god Vish&#7751;u, who dwells at Mathur&aacute;, he
entrusted to the care of Lohajangha a lotus, a club, a shell, and a
discus all of gold, to be offered to the god; Lohajangha took all
these, and mounted the bird given to him by Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a,
that could accomplish a hundred thousand <i>yojanas</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3631src" href="#xd27e3631" name=
"xd27e3631src">15</a> and rising up into the air in Lank&aacute;, he
crossed the sea and without any difficulty arrived at Mathur&aacute;.
And there he descended from the air in an empty convent outside the
town, and deposited there his abundant treasure, and tied up that bird.
And then he went into the market and sold one of his jewels, and bought
garments and scented unguents, and also food. And he ate the food in
that convent where he was, and gave some to his bird; and he adorned
himself with the garments, unguents, flowers and other decorations. And
when night came, he mounted that same bird and went to the house of
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;, bearing in his hand the shell, discus and
mace; then he hovered over it in the air, knowing the place well, and
made a low deep sound, to attract the attention of his beloved, who was
alone. But R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;, as soon as she heard that
sound, came out, and saw hovering in the air by night a being like
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a, gleaming with jewels. He said to her,
&ldquo;I am Hari come hither for thy sake;&rdquo; whereupon she bowed
with her face to the earth and said&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>&ldquo;May the god have
mercy upon me!&rdquo; Then Lohajangha descended and tied up his bird,
and entered the private apartments of his beloved hand in hand with
her. And after remaining there a short time, he came out, and mounting
the bird as before, went off through the air.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3641src" href="#xd27e3641" name="xd27e3641src">16</a> In the
morning R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; remained observing an obstinate
silence, thinking to herself&mdash;&ldquo;I am the wife of the god
Vish&#7751;u, I must cease to converse with mortals.&rdquo; And then
her mother Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute; said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;Why do
you behave in this way, my daughter?&rdquo; And after she had been
perseveringly questioned by her mother, she caused to be put up a
curtain between herself and her parent, and told her what had taken
place in the night, which was the cause of her silence. When the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> heard that, she felt doubt on the
subject, but soon after at night she saw that very Lohajangha mounted
on the bird, and in the morning Makaradansh&#7789;r&aacute; came
secretly to R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;, who still remained behind the
curtain, and inclining herself humbly, preferred to her this request;
&ldquo;Through the favour of the god, thou, my daughter, hast obtained
here on earth the rank of a goddess, and I am thy mother in this world,
therefore grant me a reward for giving thee birth; entreat the god
that, old as I am, with this very body I may enter Paradise; do me this
favour.&rdquo; R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; consented and requested
that very boon from Lohajangha, who came again at night disguised as
Vish&#7751;u. Then Lohajangha, who was personating the god, said to
that beloved of his&mdash;&ldquo;Thy mother is a wicked woman, it would
not be fitting to take her openly to Paradise, but on the morning of
the eleventh day the door of heaven is opened, and many of the
Ga&#7751;as, &#346;iva&rsquo;s companions, enter into it before any one
else is admitted. Among them I will introduce this mother of thine, if
she assume their appearance. So, shave her head with a razor, in such a
manner that five locks shall be left, put a necklace of sculls round
her neck, and stripping off her clothes, paint one side of her body
with lamp-black, and the other with red lead,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3660src" href="#xd27e3660" name="xd27e3660src">17</a> for when
she has in this way been made to resemble a Ga&#7751;a, I shall find it
an easy matter to get her into heaven.&rdquo; When he had said this,
Lohajangha remained a short time, and then departed. And in the morning
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; attired her mother as he had directed; and
then she remained with her mind entirely fixed on Paradise. So, when
night came, Lohajangha appeared again, and R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute;
handed over her mother to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>him. Then he mounted on the bird, and
took the <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> with him naked, and
transformed as he had directed, and he flew up rapidly with her into
the air. While he was in the air, he beheld a lofty stone pillar in
front of a temple, with a discus on its summit. So he placed her on the
top of the pillar, with the discus as her only support,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3668src" href="#xd27e3668" name=
"xd27e3668src">18</a> and there she hung like a banner to blazon forth
his revenge for his ill-usage. He said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Remain here
a moment while I bless the earth with my approach,&rdquo; and vanished
from her sight. Then beholding a number of people in front of the
temple, who had come there to spend the night in devout vigils before
the festive procession, he called aloud from the air&mdash;&ldquo;Hear,
ye people, this very day there shall fall upon you here the
all-destroying goddess of Pestilence, therefore fly to Hari for
protection.&rdquo; When they heard this voice from the air, all the
inhabitants of Mathur&aacute; who were there, being terrified, implored
the protection of the god, and remained devoutly muttering prayers to
ward off calamity. Lohajangha, for his part, descended from the air,
and encouraged them to pray, and after changing that dress of his, came
and stood among the people, without being observed. The
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> thought, as she sat upon the top of
the pillar,&mdash;&ldquo;the god has not come as yet, and I have not
reached heaven.&rdquo; At last feeling it impossible to remain up there
any longer, she cried out in her fear, so that the people below heard;
&ldquo;Alas! I am falling, I am falling.&rdquo; Hearing that, the
people in front of the god&rsquo;s temple were beside themselves,
fearing that the destroying goddess was falling upon them, even as had
been foretold, and said, &ldquo;O goddess, do not fall, do not
fall.&rdquo; So those people of Mathur&aacute;, young and old, spent
that night in perpetual dread that the destroying goddess would fall
upon them, but at last it came to an end; and then beholding that
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> upon the pillar in the state
described,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3678src" href="#xd27e3678" name=
"xd27e3678src">19</a> the citizens and the king recognized her at once;
all the people thereupon forgot their alarm, and burst out laughing,
and R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; herself at last arrived having heard
of the occurrence. And when she saw it, she was abashed, and with the
help of the people, who were there, she managed to get that mother of
hers down from the top of the pillar immediately: then that
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> was asked by all the people there,
who were filled with curiosity, to tell them the whole story, and she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>did so. Thereupon the king, the Br&aacute;hmans,
and the merchants, thinking that that laughable incident must have been
brought about by a sorcerer or some person of that description, made a
proclamation, that whoever had made a fool of the
<i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i>, who had deceived innumerable lovers,
was to shew himself, and he would receive a turban of honour on the
spot. When he heard that, Lohajangha made himself known to those
present, and being questioned, he related the whole story from its
commencement. And he offered to the god the discus, shell, club, and
lotus of gold, the present which Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a had sent, and
which aroused the astonishment of the people. Then all the people of
Mathur&aacute;, being pleased, immediately invested him with a turban
of honour, and by the command of the king, made that
R&uacute;pi&#7751;ik&aacute; a free woman. And then Lohajangha, having
wreaked upon the <i>ku&#7789;&#7789;in&iacute;</i> his wrath caused by
her ill-usage of him, lived in great comfort in Mathur&aacute; with
that beloved of his, being very well off by means of the large stock of
jewels which he brought from Lank&aacute;.</p>
<p>Hearing this tale from the mouth of the transformed Vasantaka,
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; who was sitting at the side of the fettered
king of Vatsa, felt extreme delight in her heart.</p>

<h2 class="main">Chapter XIII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As time went on, V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; began to
feel a great affection for the king of Vatsa, and to take part with him
against her father. Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a again came in to
see the king of Vatsa, making himself invisible to all the others, who
were there. And he gave him the following information in private in the
presence of Vasantaka only; &ldquo;King, you were made captive by king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena by means of an artifice. And he
wishes to give you his daughter, and set you at liberty, treating you
with all honour; so let us carry off his daughter and escape. For in
this way we shall have revenged ourselves upon the haughty monarch, and
we shall not be thought lightly of in the world for want of prowess.
Now the king has given that daughter of his, V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;,
a female elephant called Bhadravat&iacute;. And no other elephant but
Na&#7693;&aacute;giri is swift enough to catch her up, and he will not
fight when he sees her. The driver of this elephant is a man here
called &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;haka, and him I have won over to our
side by giving him much wealth. So you must mount that elephant with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, fully armed, and start from this place
secretly by night. And you must have the superintendent of the royal
elephants here made drunk with wine, in order that he may not perceive
what is about to take place,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3708src" href=
"#xd27e3708" name="xd27e3708src">1</a> for he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>understands every sign that elephants give. I, for
my part, will first repair to your ally Pulindaka in order that he may
be prepared to guard the road by which you escape.&rdquo; When he had
said this, Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a departed. So the king of Vatsa
stored up all his instructions in his heart; and soon
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; came to him. Then he made all kinds of
confidential speeches to her, and at last told her what
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a had said to him. She consented to the
proposal, and made up her mind to start, and causing the elephant
driver &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;haka to be summoned, she prepared his
mind for the attempt, and on the pretext of worshipping the gods, she
gave the superintendent of the elephants, with all the elephant
drivers, a supply of spirits, and made them drunk. Then in the evening,
which was disturbed with the echoing roar of clouds,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3716src" href="#xd27e3716" name="xd27e3716src">2</a>
&Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;haka brought that female elephant ready
harnessed, but she, while she was being harnessed, uttered a cry, which
was heard by the superintendent of the elephants, who was skilled in
elephants&rsquo; language; and he faltered out in a voice indistinct
from excessive intoxication,&mdash;&ldquo;the female elephant says, she
is going sixty-three <i>yojanas</i> to-day.&rdquo; But his mind in his
drunken state was not capable of reasoning, and the elephant-drivers,
who were also intoxicated, did not even hear what he said. Then the
king of Vatsa broke his chains by means of the charms, which
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a had given him, and took that lute of his,
and V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; of her own accord brought him his
weapons, and then he mounted the female elephant with Vasantaka. And
then V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; mounted the same elephant with her
friend and confidante K&aacute;nchanam&aacute;l&aacute;; then the king
of Vatsa went out from Ujjayin&iacute; with five persons in all,
including himself and the elephant-driver, by a path which the
infuriated elephant clove through the rampart.</p>
<p>And the king attacked and slew the two warriors who guarded that
point, the R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu and
T&aacute;labha&#7789;a. Then the monarch set out rapidly on his journey
in high spirits, mounted on the female elephant, together with his
beloved, &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;haka holding the elephant-hook; in
the meanwhile in Ujjayin&iacute; the city-patrol beheld those guards of
the rampart lying dead, and in consternation reported the news to the
king at night. Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena enquired into the
matter, and found out at last that the king of Vatsa had escaped,
taking V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; with him. Then the alarm spread
through the city, and one of his sons named P&aacute;laka mounted
Na&#7693;&aacute;giri and pursued the king of Vatsa. The king of Vatsa
for his part, combated him with arrows as he advanced, and
Na&#7693;&aacute;giri, seeing that female elephant, would not attack
her. Then P&aacute;laka, who was ready to listen to reason, was induced
to desist from the pursuit by his brother Gop&aacute;laka, who had his
father&rsquo;s interests at heart; then the king of Vatsa boldly
continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>his journey, and as he journeyed, the night
gradually came to an end. So by the middle of the day the king had
reached the Vindhya forest, and his elephant having journeyed
sixty-three <i>yojanas</i>, was thirsty. So the king and his wife
dismounted, and the female elephant having drunk water, owing to its
being bad, fell dead on the spot. Then the king of Vatsa and
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, in their despair, heard this voice coming
from the air&mdash;&ldquo;I, O king, am a female Vidy&aacute;dhara
named M&aacute;y&aacute;vat&iacute;, and for this long time I have been
a female elephant in consequence of a curse; and to-day, O lord of
Vatsa, I have done you a good turn, and I will do another to your son
that is to be: and this queen of yours V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; is not
a mere mortal; she is a goddess for a certain cause incarnate on the
earth.&rdquo; Then the king regained his spirits, and sent on Vasantaka
to the plateau of the Vindhya hills to announce his arrival to his ally
Pulindaka; and as he was himself journeying along slowly on foot with
his beloved, he was surrounded by brigands, who sprang out from an
ambuscade. And the king, with only his bow to help him, slew one
hundred and five of them before the eyes of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.
And immediately the king&rsquo;s ally Pulindaka came up, together with
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, Vasantaka shewing them the way. The king
of the Bheels ordered the surviving brigands<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3736src" href="#xd27e3736" name="xd27e3736src">3</a> to desist,
and after prostrating himself before the king of Vatsa, conducted him
with his beloved to his own village. The king rested there that night
with V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, whose foot had been cut with a blade of
forest grass, and early in the morning the general Ruma&#7751;vat
reached him, who had before been summoned by
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who sent a messenger to him. And the
whole army came with him, filling the land as far as the eye could
reach, so that the Vindhya forest appeared to be besieged. So that king
of Vatsa entered into the encampment of his army, and remained in that
wild region to wait for news from Ujjayin&iacute;. And, while he was
there, a merchant came from Ujjayin&iacute;, a friend of
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s, and when he had arrived reported
these tidings, &ldquo;The king Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena is
pleased to have thee for a son-in-law, and he has sent his warder to
thee. The warder is on the way, but he has stopped short of this place,
however, I came secretly on in front of him, as fast as I could, to
bring your Highness information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard this, the king of Vatsa rejoiced, and told it all to
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, and she was exceedingly delighted. Then
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, having abandoned her own relations, and
being anxious for the ceremony of marriage, was at the same time
bashful and impatient: then she said, in order <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>to
divert her thoughts, to Vasantaka who was in
attendance&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me some story.&rdquo; Then the sagacious
Vasantaka told that fair-eyed one the following tale in order to
increase her affection for her husband.</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Devasmit&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city in the world famous under the name of
T&aacute;mralipt&aacute;, and in that city there was a very rich
merchant named Dhanadatta. And he, being childless, assembled many
Br&aacute;hmans and said to them with due respect; &ldquo;Take such
steps as will procure me a son soon.&rdquo; Then those Br&aacute;hmans
said to him: &ldquo;This is not at all difficult, for Br&aacute;hmans
can accomplish all things in this world by means of ceremonies in
accordance with the scriptures. To give you an instance there was in
old time a king who had no sons, and he had a hundred and five wives in
his harem. And by means of a sacrifice to procure a son, there was born
to him a son named Jantu, who was like the rising of the new moon to
the eyes of his wives. Once on a time an ant bit the boy on the thigh
as he was crawling about on his knees, so that he was very unhappy and
sobbed loudly. Thereupon the whole harem was full of confused
lamentation, and the king himself shrieked out &lsquo;My son! my
son!&rsquo; like a common man. The boy was soon comforted, the ant
having been removed, and the king blamed the misfortune of his only
having one son as the cause of all his grief. And he asked the
Br&aacute;hmans in his affliction if there was any expedient by which
he might obtain a large number of children. They answered
him,&mdash;&lsquo;O king, there is one expedient open to you; you must
slay this son and offer up all his flesh in the fire. By smelling the
smell of that sacrifice all thy wives will obtain sons.&rsquo; When he
heard that, the king had the whole ceremony performed as they directed;
and he obtained as many sons as he had wives. So we can obtain a son
for you also by a burnt-offering.&rdquo; When they had said this to
Dhanadatta, the Br&aacute;hmans, after a sacrificial fee had been
promised them, performed a sacrifice: then a son was born to that
merchant. That son was called Guhasena, and he gradually grew up to
man&rsquo;s estate. Then his father Dhanadatta began to look out for a
wife for him.</p>
<p>Then his father went with that son of his to another country, on the
pretence of traffic, but really to get a daughter-in-law, there he
asked an excellent merchant of the name of Dharmagupta to give him his
daughter named Devasmit&aacute; for his son Guhasena. But Dharmagupta,
who was tenderly attached to his daughter, did not approve of that
connexion, reflecting that the city of T&aacute;mralipt&aacute; was
very far off. But when Devasmit&aacute; beheld that Guhasena, her mind
was immediately attracted by his virtues, and she was set on abandoning
her relations, and so she made an assignation with him by means of a
confidante, and went away from that country at night with her beloved
and his father. When they reached T&aacute;mralipt&aacute; they were
married, and the minds of the young couple were firmly knit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>together by the bond of mutual love. Then
Guhasena&rsquo;s father died, and he himself was urged by his relations
to go to the country of Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3758src" href="#xd27e3758" name="xd27e3758src">4</a> for the
purpose of trafficking; but his wife Devasmit&aacute; was too jealous
to approve of that expedition, fearing exceedingly that he would be
attracted by some other lady. Then, as his wife did not approve of it,
and his relations kept inciting him to it, Guhasena, whose mind was
firmly set on doing his duty, was bewildered. Then he went and
performed a vow in the temple of the god, observing a rigid fast,
trusting that the god would shew him some way out of his difficulty.
And his wife Devasmi&#7789;&aacute; also performed a vow with him; then
&#346;iva was pleased to appear to that couple in a dream; and giving
them two red lotuses the god said to them,&mdash;&ldquo;take each, of
you one of these lotuses in your hand. And if either of you shall be
unfaithful during your separation, the lotus in the hand of the other
shall fade, but not otherwise<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3761src" href=
"#xd27e3761" name="xd27e3761src">5</a>.&rdquo; After hearing this, the
two woke up, and each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>beheld in the hand of the other a red lotus,
and it seemed as if they had got one another&rsquo;s hearts. Then
Guhasena set out, lotus in hand, but Devasmit&aacute; remained in the
house with her eyes fixed upon her flower. Guhasena for his part
quickly reached the country of Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha, and began to buy
and sell jewels there. And four young merchants in that country, seeing
that that unfading lotus was ever in his hand, were greatly astonished.
Accordingly they got him to their house by an artifice, and made him
drink a great deal of wine, and then asked him the history of the
lotus, and he being intoxicated told them the whole story. Then those
four young merchants, knowing that Guhasena would take a long time to
complete his sales and purchases of jewels and other wares, planned
together, like rascals as they were, the seduction of his wife out of
curiosity, and eager to accomplish it set out quickly for
T&aacute;mralipt&aacute; without their departure being noticed. There
they cast about for some instrument, and at last had recourse to a
female ascetic of the name of Yogakara&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute;, who
lived in a sanctuary of Buddha; and they said to her in an affectionate
manner, &ldquo;Reverend madam, if our object is accomplished by your
help, we will give you much wealth.&rdquo; She answered them; &ldquo;No
doubt, you young men desire some woman in this city, so tell me all
about it, I will procure you the object of your desire, but I have no
wish for money; I have a pupil of distinguished ability named
Siddhikar&iacute;; owing to her kindness I have obtained untold
wealth.&rdquo; The young merchants asked&mdash;&ldquo;How have you
obtained untold wealth by the assistance of a pupil?&rdquo; Being asked
this question, the female ascetic said,&mdash;&ldquo;If you feel any
curiosity about the matter, listen, my sons, I will tell you the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the cunning Siddhikar&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago a certain merchant came here from the north;
while he was dwelling here, my pupil went and obtained, with a
treacherous object, the position of a serving-maid in his house, having
first altered her appearance, and after she had gained the confidence
of that merchant, she stole all his hoard of gold from his house, and
went off secretly in the morning twilight. And as she went out from the
city moving rapidly through fear, a certain &#7692;omba<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3838src" href="#xd27e3838" name="xd27e3838src">6</a>
with his drum in his hand, saw her, and pursued her at full speed with
the intention of robbing her. When she had reached the foot of a
Nyagrodha tree, she saw that he had come up with her, and so the
cunning Siddhikar&iacute; said this to him in a plaintive manner,
&ldquo;I have had a jealous quarrel with my husband, and I have left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>his house to die, therefore my good man, make a
noose for me to hang myself with.&rdquo; Then the &#7692;omba thought,
&ldquo;Let her hang herself, why should I be guilty of her death,
especially as she is a woman,&rdquo; and so he fastened a noose for her
to the tree. Then Siddhikar&iacute;, feigning ignorance, said to the
&#7692;omba, &ldquo;How is the noose slipped round the neck? shew me, I
entreat you.&rdquo; Then the &#7692;omba placed the drum under his
feet, and saying,&mdash;&ldquo;This is the way we do the
trick&rdquo;&mdash;he fastened the noose round his own throat;
Siddhikar&iacute; for her part smashed the drum to atoms with a kick,
and that &#7692;omba hung till he was dead.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3843src" href="#xd27e3843" name="xd27e3843src">7</a> At that
moment the merchant arrived in search of her, and beheld from a
distance Siddhikar&iacute;, who had stolen from him untold treasures,
at the foot of the tree. She too saw him coming, and climbed up the
tree without being noticed, and remained there on a bough, having her
body concealed by the dense foliage. When the merchant came up with his
servants, he saw the &#7692;omba hanging by his neck, but
Siddhikar&iacute; was nowhere to be seen. Immediately one of his
servants said &ldquo;I wonder whether she has got up this tree,&rdquo;
and proceeded to ascend it himself. Then Siddhikar&iacute;
said&mdash;&ldquo;I have always loved you, and now you have climbed up
where I am, so all this wealth is at your disposal, handsome man, come
and embrace me.&rdquo; So she embraced the merchant&rsquo;s servant,
and as she was kissing his mouth, she bit off the fool&rsquo;s tongue.
He, overcome with the pain, fell from that tree, spitting blood from
his mouth, uttering some indistinct syllables, which sounded like
Lalalla. When he saw that, the merchant was terrified, and supposing
that his servant had been seized by a demon, he fled from that place,
and went to his own house with his attendants. Then Siddhikar&iacute;
the female ascetic, equally frightened, descended from the top of the
tree, and brought home with her all that wealth. Such a person is my
pupil, distinguished for her great discernment, and it is in this way,
my sons, that I have obtained wealth by her kindness.</p>
<p>When she had said this to the young merchants, the female ascetic
shewed to them her pupil who happened to come in at that moment; and
said to them, &ldquo;Now, my sons, tell me the real state of
affairs&mdash;what woman do you desire? I will quickly procure her for
you.&rdquo; When they heard that they said, &ldquo;procure us an
interview with the wife of the merchant Guhasena named
Devasmit&aacute;.&rdquo; When she heard that, the ascetic undertook to
manage that business for them, and she gave those young merchants her
own house to reside in. Then she gratified the servants at
Guhasena&rsquo;s house with gifts of sweetmeats and other things, and
afterwards entered it with her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>pupil. Then, as she approached
the private rooms of Devasmit&aacute;, a bitch, that was fastened there
with a chain, would not let her come near, but opposed her entrance in
the most determined way. Then Devasmit&aacute; seeing her, of her own
accord sent a maid, and had her brought in, thinking to herself,
&ldquo;What can this person be come for?&rdquo; After she had entered,
the wicked ascetic gave Devasmit&aacute; her blessing, and, treating
the virtuous woman with affected respect, said to her&mdash;&ldquo;I
have always had a desire to see you, but to-day I saw you in a dream,
therefore I have come to visit you with impatient eagerness; and my
mind is afflicted at beholding you separated from your husband, for
beauty and youth are wasted when one is deprived of the society of
one&rsquo;s beloved.&rdquo; With this and many other speeches of the
same kind she tried to gain the confidence of the virtuous woman in a
short interview, and then taking leave of her she returned to her own
house. On the second day she took with her a piece of meat full of
pepper dust, and went again to the house of Devasmit&aacute;, and there
she gave that piece of meat to the bitch at the door, and the bitch
gobbled it up, pepper and all. Then owing to the pepper dust, the tears
flowed in profusion from the animal&rsquo;s eyes, and her nose began to
run. And the cunning ascetic immediately went into the apartment of
Devasmit&aacute;, who received her hospitably, and began to cry. When
Devasmit&aacute; asked her why she shed tears, she said with affected
reluctance: &ldquo;My friend, look at this bitch weeping outside here.
This creature recognized me to-day as having been its companion in a
former birth, and began to weep; for that reason my tears gushed
through pity.&rdquo; When she heard that, and saw that bitch outside
apparently weeping, Devasmit&aacute; thought for a moment to herself,
&ldquo;What can be the meaning of this wonderful sight?&rdquo; Then the
ascetic said to her, &ldquo;My daughter, in a former birth, I and that
bitch were the two wives of a certain Br&aacute;hman. And our husband
frequently went about to other countries on embassies by order of the
king. Now while he was away from home, I lived with other men at my
pleasure, and so did not cheat the elements, of which I was composed,
and my senses, of their lawful enjoyment. For considerate treatment of
the elements and senses is held to be the highest duty. Therefore I
have been born in this birth with a recollection of my former
existence. But she, in her former life, through ignorance, confined all
her attention to the preservation of her character, therefore she has
been degraded and born again as one of the canine race, however, she
too remembers her former birth.&rdquo; The wise Devasmit&aacute; said
to herself, &ldquo;This is a novel conception of duty; no doubt this
woman has laid a treacherous snare for me&rdquo;; and so she said to
her, &ldquo;Reverend lady, for this long time I have been ignorant of
this duty, so procure me an interview with some charming
man.&rdquo;&mdash;Then the ascetic said&mdash;&ldquo;There are residing
here some young merchants that have come from another country,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>so I will bring them to you.&rdquo; When she had
said this, the ascetic returned home delighted, and Devasmit&aacute; of
her own accord said to her maids: &ldquo;No doubt those scoundrelly
young merchants, whoever they may be, have seen that unfading lotus in
the hand of my husband, and have on some occasion or other, when he was
drinking wine, asked him out of curiosity to tell the whole story of
it, and have now come here from that island to seduce me, and this
wicked ascetic is employed by them. So bring quickly some wine mixed
with Datura,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3852src" href="#xd27e3852"
name="xd27e3852src">8</a> and when you have brought it, have a
dog&rsquo;s foot of iron made as quickly as possible.&rdquo; When
Devasmit&aacute; had given these orders, the maids executed them
faithfully, and one of the maids, by her orders, dressed herself up to
resemble her mistress. The ascetic for her part chose out of the party
of four merchants, (each of whom in his eagerness said&mdash;&ldquo;let
me go first&rdquo;&mdash;) one individual, and brought him with her.
And concealing him in the dress of her pupil, she introduced him in the
evening into the house of Devasmit&aacute;, and coming out,
disappeared. Then that maid, who was disguised as Devasmit&aacute;,
courteously persuaded the young merchant to drink some of that wine
drugged with Datura. That liquor,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3858src"
href="#xd27e3858" name="xd27e3858src">9</a> like his own immodesty,
robbed him of his senses, and then the maids took away his clothes and
other equipments and left him stark naked; then they branded him on the
forehead with the mark of a dog&rsquo;s foot, and during the night took
him and pushed him into a ditch full of filth. Then he recovered
consciousness in the last watch of the night, and found himself plunged
in a ditch, as it were the hell <i>Av&iacute;chi</i> assigned to him by
his sins. Then he got up and washed himself and went to the house of
the female ascetic, in a state of nature, feeling with his fingers the
mark on his forehead. And when he got there, he told his friends that
he had been robbed on the way, in order that he might not be the only
person made ridiculous. And the next morning he sat with a cloth
wrapped round his branded forehead, giving as an excuse that he had a
headache from keeping awake so long, and drinking too much. In the same
way the next young merchant was maltreated, when he got to the house of
Devasmit&aacute;, and when he returned home naked, he said, &ldquo;I
put on my ornaments there, and as I was coming out I was plundered by
robbers.&rdquo; In the morning he also, on the plea of a headache, put
a wrapper on to cover his branded forehead.</p>
<p>In the same way all the four young merchants suffered in turns
branding and other humiliating treatment, though they concealed the
fact. And they went away from the place, without revealing to the
female Buddhist ascetic the ill-treatment they had experienced, hoping
that she would suffer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>in a similar way. On the next day the ascetic
went with her disciple to the house of Devasmit&aacute;, much delighted
at having accomplished what she undertook to do. Then Devasmit&aacute;
received her courteously, and made her drink wine drugged with Datura,
offered as a sign of gratitude. When she and her disciple were
intoxicated with it, that chaste wife cut off their ears and noses, and
flung them also into a filthy pool. And being distressed by the thought
that perhaps these young merchants might go and slay her husband, she
told the whole circumstance to her mother-in-law. Then her
mother-in-law said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;My daughter, you have acted
nobly, but possibly some misfortune may happen to my son in consequence
of what you have done.&rdquo; Then Devasmit&aacute; said&mdash;I will
deliver him even as &#346;aktimat&iacute; in old time delivered her
husband by her wisdom. Her mother-in-law asked; &ldquo;How did
&#346;aktimat&iacute; deliver her husband? tell me, my daughter.&rdquo;
Then Devasmit&aacute; related the following story:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of &#346;aktimat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In our country, within the city, there is the shrine
of a powerful Yaksha named Ma&#7751;ibhadra, established by our
ancestors. The people there come and make petitions at this shrine,
offering various gifts, in order to obtain various blessings. Whenever
a man is found at night with another man&rsquo;s wife, he is placed
with her within the inner chamber of the Yaksha&rsquo;s temple. And in
the morning he is taken away from thence with the woman to the
king&rsquo;s court, and his behaviour being made known, he is punished;
such is the custom. Once on a time in that city a merchant, of the name
of Samudradatta, was found by a city-guard in the company of another
man&rsquo;s wife. So he took him and placed him with the woman in that
temple of the Yaksha, fastening the door firmly. And immediately the
wise and devoted wife of that merchant, whose name was
&#346;aktimat&iacute;, came to hear of the occurrence; then that
resolute woman, disguising herself, went confidently at night to the
temple of the Yaksha, accompanied by her friends, taking with her
offerings for the god. When she arrived there, the priest whose
business it was to eat the offerings, through desire for a fee, opened
the door and let her enter, informing the magistrate of what he had
done. And she, when she got inside, saw her husband looking sheepish,
with a woman, and she made the woman put on her own dress, and told her
to go out. So that woman went out in her dress by night, and got off,
but <span class="corr" id="xd27e3879" title=
"Source: &#346;aktimati">&#346;aktimat&iacute;</span> remained in the
temple with her husband. And when the king&rsquo;s officers came in the
morning to examine the merchant, he was seen by all to be in the
company of his own wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3882src" href=
"#xd27e3882" name="xd27e3882src">10</a> When he heard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>that,
the king dismissed the merchant from the temple of the Yaksha, as it
were from the mouth of death, and punished the chief magistrate. So
&#346;aktimat&iacute; in old time delivered her husband by her wisdom,
and in the same way I will go and save my husband by my discretion.</p>
<p>So the wise Devasmit&aacute; said in secret to her mother-in-law,
and, in company with her maids, she put on the dress of a merchant.
Then she embarked on a ship, on the pretence of a mercantile
expedition, and came to the country of Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha where her
husband was. And when she arrived there, she saw that husband of hers,
Guhasena, in the midst of a circle of merchants, like consolation in
external bodily form. He seeing her afar off in the dress of a
man,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3896src" href="#xd27e3896" name=
"xd27e3896src">11</a> as it were, drank her in with his eyes, and
thought to himself, &ldquo;Who may this merchant be that looks so like
my beloved wife&rdquo;? So Devasmit&aacute; went and represented to the
king that she had a petition to make, and asked him to assemble all his
subjects. Then the king full of curiosity assembled all the citizens,
and said to that lady disguised as a merchant, &ldquo;What is your
petition?&rdquo; Then Devasmit&aacute; said&mdash;There are residing
here in your midst four slaves of mine who have escaped, let the king
make them over to me. Then the king said to her, &ldquo;All the
citizens are present here, so look at every one in order to recognise
him, and take those slaves of yours.&rdquo; Then she seized upon the
four young merchants, whom she had before treated in such a humiliating
way in her house, and who had wrappers bound round their heads. Then
the merchants, who were there, flew in a passion, and said to her,
&ldquo;These are the sons of distinguished merchants, how then can they
be your slaves?&rdquo; Then she answered them, &ldquo;If you do not
believe what I say, examine their foreheads which I marked with a
dog&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo; They consented, and removing the head-wrappers
of these four, they all beheld the dog&rsquo;s foot on their foreheads.
Then all the merchants were abashed, and the king, being astonished,
himself asked Devasmit&aacute; what all this meant. She told the whole
story, and all the people burst out laughing, and the king said to the
lady,&mdash;&ldquo;They are your slaves by the best of titles.&rdquo;
Then the other merchants paid a large sum of money to that chaste wife,
to redeem those four from slavery, and a fine to the king&rsquo;s
treasury. Devasmit&aacute; received that money, and recovered her
husband, and being honoured by all good men, returned then to her own
city T&aacute;mralipt&aacute;, and she was never afterwards separated
from her beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, O queen, women of good family ever worship their
husbands with chaste and resolute behaviour,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3901src" href="#xd27e3901" name="xd27e3901src">12</a> and never
think of any other man, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>to virtuous wives the husband is the
highest deity.&rdquo; When V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; on the journey
heard this noble story from the mouth of Vasantaka, she got over the
feeling of shame at having recently left her father&rsquo;s house, and
her mind, which was previously attached by strong affection to her
husband, became so fixed upon him as to be entirely devoted to his
service.</p>

<h3 class="main">Note on Chapter XIII.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With regard to the incident of the bitch and the
pepper in the story of Devasmit&aacute; see the note in the 1st volume
of Wilson&rsquo;s Essays on Sanskrit Literature. He says: &ldquo;This
incident with a very different and much less moral <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;nouement</i> is one of the stories in the Disciplina
Clericalis, a collection of stories professedly derived from the
Arabian fabulists and compiled by Petrus Alfonsus a converted Jew, who
flourished about 1106 and was godson to Alfonso I, king of Arragon. In
the Analysis prepared by Mr. Douce, this story is the 12th, and is
entitled &ldquo;Stratagem of an old woman in favour of a young
gallant.&rdquo; She persuades his mistress who had rejected his
addresses that her little dog was formerly a woman, and so transformed
in consequence of her cruelty to her lover. (Ellis&rsquo;s Metrical
Romances, I, 130.) This story was introduced into Europe, therefore,
much about the time at which it was enrolled among the contents of the
V&#7771;ihat Kath&aacute; in Cashmir. The metempsychosis is so much
more obvious an explanation of the change of forms, that it renders it
probable the story was originally Hindu. It was soon copied in Europe,
and occurs in Le Grand as <i lang="fr">La vieille qui s&eacute;duisit
la jeune fille</i>. III. 148 [ed. III. Vol. IV. 50]. The parallel is
very close and the old woman gives &ldquo;<i lang="fr">une chienne
&agrave; manger des choses fortement saupoudr&egrave;es de
sen&egrave;ve qui lai picotait le palais et les narines et
l&rsquo;animal larmoyait beaucoup</i>.&rdquo; She then shows her to the
young woman and tells her the bitch was her daughter. &ldquo;<i lang=
"fr">Son malheur fut d&rsquo;avoir le c&oelig;ur dur; un jeune homme
l&rsquo;aimait, elle le rebuta. Le malheureux apr&egrave;s avoir tout
tent&eacute; pour l&rsquo; attendrir, d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute; de
sa duret&eacute; en prit tant de chagrin qu&rsquo;il tomba malade et
mourut. Dieu l&rsquo;a bien veng&egrave;; voyez en quel &eacute;tat
pour la punir il a reduit ma pauvre fille, et comment elle pleure sa
faute.</i>&rdquo; The lesson was not thrown away. The story occurs also
in the Gesta Romanorum as &ldquo;The Old Woman and her Dog&rdquo; [in
Bohn&rsquo;s edition it is Tale XXVIII], and it also finds a place
where we should little have expected to find it, in the Promptuarium of
John Herolt of Basil, an ample repository of examples for composing
sermons: the compiler a Dominican friar, professing to imitate his
patron saint, who always <i lang="la">abundabat exemplis</i> in his
discourses.&rdquo; [In Bohn&rsquo;s edition we are told that it appears
in an English garb amongst a translation of &AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables
published in 1658.] Dr. Rost refers us to Th. Wright, Latin Stories,

<p class="first">Accordingly while the king of Vatsa was remaining in
that Vindhya forest, the warder of king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena came to him. And when he arrived, he
did obeisance to the king and spoke as follows: The king
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena sends you this message. You did
rightly in carrying off V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; yourself, for I had
brought you to my court with this very object; and the reason I did not
myself give her to you, while you were a prisoner, was, that I feared,
if I did so, you might not be well disposed towards me. Now, O king, I
ask you to wait a little, in order that the marriage of my daughter may
not be performed without due ceremonies. For my son Gop&aacute;laka
will soon arrive in your court, and he will celebrate with appropriate
ceremonies the marriage of that sister of his. This message the warder
brought to the king of Vatsa, and said various things to
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. Then the king of Vatsa, being pleased,
determined on going to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who was also in high spirits. He told his
ally Pulindaka, and that warder in the service of his father-in-law to
await, where they were, the arrival of Gop&aacute;laka, and then to
come with him to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;. Then the great king set
out early the next day for his own city with the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, followed by huge elephants raining streams
of ichor, that seemed like moving peaks of the Vindhya range
accompanying him out of affection; he was, as it were, praised by the
earth, that outdid the compositions of his minstrels, while it rang
with the hoofs of his horses and the tramplings of his soldiers; and by
means of the towering clouds of dust from his army, that ascended to
heaven, he made Indra fear that the mountains were sporting with
unshorn wings.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3951src" href="#xd27e3951"
name="xd27e3951src">1</a> Then the king reached his country in two or
three days, and rested one night in a palace belonging to
Ruma&#7751;vat; and on the next day, accompanied by his beloved, he
enjoyed after a long absence the great delight of entering
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, the people of which were eagerly looking
with uplifted faces for his approach. And then that city was
resplendent as a wife, her lord having returned after a long absence,
beginning her adornment and auspicious bathing vicariously by means of
her women; and there the citizens, their sorrow now at an end, beheld
the king of Vatsa accompanied by his bride, as peacocks behold a cloud

blooming in the heavenly Ganges. Then the king of Vatsa entered his
royal palace with V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who seemed like a second
goddess of royal fortune; and that palace then shone as if it had just
awaked from sleep, full of kings who had come to shew their devotion,
festive with songs of minstrels.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3959src"
href="#xd27e3959" name="xd27e3959src">3</a> Not long after came
Gop&aacute;laka the brother of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, bringing with
him the warder and Pulindaka; the king went to meet him, and
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; received him with her eyes expanded with
delight, as if he were a second spirit of joy. While she was looking at
this brother, a tear dimmed her eyes lest she should be ashamed; and
then she, being encouraged by him with the words of her father&rsquo;s
message, considered that her object in life was attained, now that she
was reunited to her own relations. Then, on the next day,
Gop&aacute;laka, with the utmost eagerness, set about the high festival
of her marriage with the king of Vatsa, carefully observing all
prescribed ceremonies. Then the king of Vatsa received the hand of
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, like a beautiful shoot lately budded on the
creeper of love. She too, with her eyes closed through the great joy of
touching her beloved&rsquo;s hand, having her limbs bathed in
perspiration accompanied with trembling, covered all over with extreme
horripilation, appeared at that moment as if struck by the god of the
flowery bow with the arrow of bewilderment, the weapon of wind, and the
water weapon in quick succession;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3962src"

<h3 class="main">Story of the clever deformed child.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time there was a certain Br&aacute;hman
named Rudra&#347;arman, and he, when he became a householder, had two
wives, and one of his wives gave birth to a son and died; and then the
Br&aacute;hman entrusted that son to the care of his step-mother; and
when he grew to a tolerable stature, she gave him coarse food; the
consequence was, the boy became pale, and got a swollen stomach. Then
Rudra&#347;arman said to that second wife, &ldquo;How comes it that you
have neglected this child of mine that has lost its mother?&rdquo; She
said to her husband, &ldquo;Though I take affectionate care of him, he
is nevertheless the strange object you see; what am I to do with
him?&rdquo; Whereupon the Br&aacute;hman thought, &ldquo;No doubt it is
the child&rsquo;s nature to be like this.&rdquo; For who sees through
the deceitfulness of the speeches of women uttered with affected
simplicity? Then that child began to go by the name of
B&aacute;lavinash&#7789;aka<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3981src" href=
"#xd27e3981" name="xd27e3981src">7</a> in his father&rsquo;s house,
because they said this child (<i>b&aacute;la</i>) is deformed
(<i>vinash&#7789;a</i>.) Then B&aacute;lavinash&#7789;aka thought to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;This step-mother of mine is always ill-treating
me, therefore I had better be revenged on her in some
way&rdquo;&mdash;for though the boy was only a little more than five
years old, he was clever enough. Then he said secretly to his father
when he returned from the king&rsquo;s court, with half suppressed
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Papa, I have two Papas.&rdquo; So the boy said every
day, and his father suspecting that his wife had a paramour, would not
even touch her. She for her part thought&mdash;&ldquo;Why is my husband
angry without my being guilty; I wonder whether
B&aacute;lavinash&#7789;aka has been at any tricks?&rdquo; So she
washed B&aacute;lavinash&#7789;aka with careful kindness, and gave him
dainty food, and taking him on her lap, asked him the following
question: &ldquo;My son why have you incensed your father
Rudra&#347;arman against me?&rdquo; When he heard that, the boy said to
his step-mother, &ldquo;I will do more harm to you than that, if you do
not immediately cease ill-treating me. You take good care of your own
children; why do you perpetually torment me?&rdquo; When she heard
that, she bowed before him, and said with a solemn oath, &ldquo;I will
not do so any more; so reconcile my husband to me.&rdquo; Then the
child said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Well, when my father comes home, let one
of your maids shew him a mirror, and leave the rest to me.&rdquo; She
said, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and by her orders a maid shewed a mirror
to her husband as soon as he returned home. Thereupon the child
pointing out the reflection of his father in the mirror, said,
&ldquo;There is my second father.&rdquo; When he heard that,
Rudra&#347;arman dismissed his suspicions and was immediately
reconciled to his wife, whom he had blamed without cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus even a child may do mischief if it is annoyed, and
therefore we must carefully conciliate all this retinue.&rdquo; Saying
this, Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a with the help of Ruma&#7751;vat,
carefully honoured all the people on this the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>king of
Vatsa&rsquo;s great day of rejoicing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3994src" href="#xd27e3994" name="xd27e3994src">8</a> And they
gratified all the kings so successfully that each one of them thought,
&ldquo;These two men are devoted to me alone.&rdquo; And the king
honoured those two ministers and Vasantaka with garments, unguents, and
ornaments bestowed with his own hand, and he also gave them grants of
villages. Then the king of Vatsa, having celebrated the great festival
of his marriage, considered all his wishes gratified, now that he was
linked to V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. Their mutual love, having
blossomed after a long time of expectation, was so great, owing to the
strength of their passion, that their hearts continually resembled
those of the sorrowing Chakrav&aacute;kas, when the night, during which
they are separated, comes to an end. And as the familiarity of the
couple increased, their love seemed to be ever renewed. Then
Gop&aacute;laka, being ordered by his father to return to get married
himself, went away, after having been entreated by the king of Vatsa to
return quickly.</p>
<p>In course of time the king of Vatsa became faithless, and secretly
loved an attendant of the harem named Virachit&aacute;, with whom he
had previously had an intrigue. One day he made a mistake and addressed
the queen by her name, thereupon he had to conciliate her by clinging
to her feet, and bathed in her tears he was anointed<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4002src" href="#xd27e4002" name="xd27e4002src">9</a> a
fortunate king. Moreover he married a princess of the name of
Bandhumat&iacute;, whom Gop&aacute;laka had captured by the might of
his arm, and sent as a present to the queen; and whom she concealed,
changing her name to Manjulik&aacute;; who seemed like another
Lakshm&iacute; issuing from the sea of beauty. Her the king saw, when
he was in the company of Vasantaka, and secretly married her by the
G&aacute;ndharva ceremony in a summer-house. And that proceeding of his
was beheld by V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who was in concealment, and
she was angry, and had Vasantaka put in fetters. Then the king had
recourse to the good offices of a female ascetic, a friend of the
queen&rsquo;s, who had come with her from her father&rsquo;s court, of
the name of S&aacute;nkrity&aacute;nan&iacute;. She appeased the
queen&rsquo;s anger, and got Bandhumat&iacute; presented to the king by
the obedient queen, for tender is the heart of virtuous wives. Then the
queen released Vasantaka from imprisonment; he came into the presence
of the queen and said to her with a laugh, &ldquo;Bandhumat&iacute; did
you an injury, but what did I do to you? You are angry with
adders<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4005src" href="#xd27e4005" name=
"xd27e4005src">10</a> and you kill water-snakes.&rdquo; Then the queen,
out of curiosity, asked him to explain that metaphor, and he continued
as follows:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Ruru.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time a hermit&rsquo;s son of the name of
Ruru, wandering about at will, saw a maiden of wonderful beauty, the
daughter of a heavenly nymph named Menak&aacute; by a
Vidy&aacute;dhara, and brought up by a hermit of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>the name
of Sth&uacute;lake&#347;a in his hermitage. That lady, whose name was
Prisha&#7693;var&aacute;, so captivated the mind of that Ruru when he
saw her, that <span class="corr" id="xd27e4015" title=
"Source: he went and begged the hermit to give him to her in marriage">he
went and begged the hermit to give her to him in marriage</span>.
Sth&uacute;lake&#347;a for his part betrothed the maiden to him, and
when the wedding was nigh at hand, suddenly an adder bit her. Then the
heart of Ruru was full of despair, but he heard this voice in the
heaven&mdash;&ldquo;O Br&aacute;hman raise to life with the gift of
half thy own life,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4018src" href=
"#xd27e4018" name="xd27e4018src">11</a> this maiden, whose allotted
term is at an end.&rdquo; When he heard that, Ruru gave her the half of
his own life, as he had been directed; by means of that she revived,
and Ruru married her. Thenceforward he was incensed with the whole race
of serpents, and whenever he saw a serpent he killed it, thinking to
himself as he killed each one&mdash;&ldquo;This may have bitten my
wife.&rdquo; One day a water snake said to him with human voice, as he
was about to slay it, &ldquo;You are incensed against adders,
Br&aacute;hman, but why do you slay water-snakes? An adder bit your
wife, and adders are a distinct species from water-snakes; all adders
are venomous, water-snakes are not venomous.&rdquo; When he heard that,
he said in answer to the water-snake,&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, who are
you?&rdquo; The water-snake said, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I am a hermit
fallen from my high estate by a curse, and this curse was appointed to
last till I held converse with you.&rdquo; When he had said this he
disappeared, and after that Ruru did not kill water-snakes. So I said
this to you metaphorically, &ldquo;My queen, you are angry with adders
and you kill water-snakes.&rdquo; When he had uttered this speech, full
of pleasing wit, Vasantaka ceased, and V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
sitting at the side of her husband was pleased with him. Such soft and
sweet tales in which Vasantaka displayed various ingenuity, did the
loving Udayana, king of Vatsa, continually make use of to conciliate
his angry wife, while he sat at her feet. That happy king&rsquo;s
tongue was ever exclusively employed in tasting the flavour of wine,
and his ear was ever delighting in the sweet sounds of the lute, and
his eye was ever riveted on the face of his beloved.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The practice of walking round an object of reverence
with the right hand towards it, which is one of the ceremonies
mentioned in our author&rsquo;s account of
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;&rsquo;s marriage, has been exhaustively
discussed by Dr. Samuel Fergusson in his paper&mdash;&ldquo;On the
Ceremonial turn called Desiul,&rdquo; published in the Proceedings of
the Royal Irish Academy for March 1877. (Vol. I. Ser. II. No. 12.) He
shews it to have existed among the ancient Romans as well as the Celts.
One of the most striking of his quotations is from the Curculio of
Plautus (I. 1. 69.) Ph&aelig;dromus says&mdash;<i lang="la">Quo me
vortam nescio</i>. Palinurus jestingly replies&mdash;<i lang="la">Si
deos salutas dextrovorsum censeo</i>. Cp. also the following passage of
Valerius Flaceus (Argon VIII. 243). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99"

text. Cp. also Plutarch in this life of Camillus <span class="trans"

It is possible that the following passage in Lucretius alludes to the

<p class="line">Vertier ad lapidem atque omnes accedere ad aras.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Dr. Fergusson is of opinion that this movement was a
symbol of the cosmical rotation, an imitation of the apparent course of
the sun in the heavens. Cp. Hyginus Fable CCV. <i lang="la">Arge
venatrix, cum cervum sequeretur, cervo dixisse fertur: Tu licet Solis
cursum sequaris, tamen te consequar. Sol, iratus, in cervam eam
convertit.</i> He quotes, to prove that the practice existed among the
ancient Celts, Athen&aelig;us IV, p. 142, who adduces from Posidonius
the following statement &ldquo;<span class="trans" title=
"Tous theous proskynousin epi dexia strephomenoi."><span class="Greek"

The above quotations are but a few scraps from the full feast of Dr.
Fergusson&rsquo;s paper. See also the remarks of the Rev. S. Beal in
the Indian Antiquary for March 1880, p. 67.</p>
<p>See also Henderson&rsquo;s Folk-lore of the Northern Counties, p.
45. &ldquo;The vicar of Stranton was standing at the churchyard gate,
awaiting the arrival of a funeral party, when to his astonishment the
whole group, who had arrived within a few yards of him, suddenly
wheeled and made the circuit of the churchyard wall, thus traversing
its west, north, and east boundaries, and making the distance some five
or six times greater than was necessary. The vicar, astonished at this
proceeding, asked the sexton the reason of so extraordinary a movement.
The reply was as follows: &lsquo;Why, ye wad no hae them carry the dead
again the sun; the dead maun aye go with the sun.&rsquo; This custom is
no doubt an ancient British or Celtic custom, and corresponds to the
Highland usage of making the deazil or walking three times round a
person according to the course of the sun. Old Highlanders will still
make the deazil around those to whom they wish well. To go round the
person in the opposite direction, or &ldquo;withershins,&rdquo; is an
evil incantation and brings ill-fortune. Hunt in his Romances and
Drolls of the West of England, p. 418<span class="corr" id="xd27e4080"
title="Source: .">,</span> says, &ldquo;If an invalid goes out for the
first time, and makes a circuit, the circuit must be with the sun, if
against the sun, there will be a relapse. Liebrecht, <span lang=
"de">Zur Volkskunde</span>, p. 322, quotes from the Statistical Account
of Scotland, Vol. V. p. 88 the following statement of a Scottish
minister, with reference to a marriage ceremony: &ldquo;After leaving
the church, the whole company walk round it, keeping the church walls
always on the right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thiselton Dyer, in his English Folk-lore, p. 171, mentions a similar
custom as existing in the West of England. In Devonshire blackhead or
pinsoles are cured by creeping on one&rsquo;s hands and knees under or
through a bramble three times with the sun; that is from east to west.
See also Ralston&rsquo;s Songs of the Russian people, p. 299.</p>
<p>See also the extract from Sinclair&rsquo;s Statistical Account of
Scotland in Brand&rsquo;s Popular Antiquities, Vol. 1, p. 225;
&ldquo;When a Highlander goes to bathe or to drink water out of a
consecrated fountain, he must always approach by going round the place
from East to West on the South side, in imitation of the apparent
diurnal motion of the sun. This is called in Gaelic going round the
right, or the lucky way. The opposite course is the wrong, or the
unlucky way. And if a person&rsquo;s meat or drink were to affect the
wind-pipe, or come against his breath, they would instantly cry out,
&ldquo;Desheal,&rdquo; which is an ejaculation praying it may go by the
right way.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Cp.

about to be married, when Charon comes to fetch him. He supplicates St.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time there was a king named Mah&aacute;sena,
and he was attacked by another king far superior to him in power. Then
the king&rsquo;s ministers met together, and in order to prevent the
ruin of his interests, Mah&aacute;sena was persuaded by them to pay
tribute to that enemy. And after he had paid tribute, that haughty king
was exceedingly afflicted, thinking <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>to himself,
&ldquo;Why have I made submission to my enemy?&rdquo; And his sorrow on
that account caused an abscess to form in his vitals, and he was so
pulled down by the abscess that at last he was at the point of death.
Then a certain wise physician considering that that case could not be
cured by medicine, said falsely to that king; &ldquo;O king, your wife
is dead.&rdquo; When he heard that, the king suddenly fell on the
ground, and owing to the excessive violence of his grief, the abscess
burst of itself. And so the king recovered from his disease, and long
enjoyed in the society of that queen the pleasures he desired, and
conquered his enemies in his turn.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4130src"
href="#xd27e4130" name="xd27e4130src">3</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So, as that physician did his king a good turn by his wisdom,
let us also do our king a good turn, let us gain for him the empire of
the earth. And in this undertaking our only adversary is Pradyota, the
king of Magadha; for he is a foe in the rear that is always attacking
us behind. So we must ask for our sovereign that pearl of princesses,
his daughter, named Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. And by our cleverness we
will conceal V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; somewhere, and setting fire to
her house, we will give out everywhere that the queen is burnt. For in
no other case will the king of Magadha give his daughter to our
sovereign, for when I requested him to do so on a former occasion, he
answered&mdash;&lsquo;I will not give my daughter, whom I love more
than myself, to the king of Vatsa, for he is passionately attached to
his wife V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.&rsquo; Moreover, as long as the
queen is alive, the king of Vatsa will not marry any one else; but if a
report is once spread that the queen is burnt, all will succeed. And
when Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; is secured, the king of Magadha will be
our marriage connection, and will not attack us in the rear, but will
become our ally. Then we will march to conquer the eastern quarter, and
the others in due succession, so we shall obtain for the king of Vatsa
all this earth. And if we only exert ourselves, this king will obtain
the dominion of the earth, for long ago a divine voice predicted
this.&rdquo; When Ruma&#7751;vat heard this speech from the great
minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, he feared that the plan would
cover them with ridicule, and so he said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Deception
practised for the sake of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; might some day be to
the ruin of us both;&rdquo; in proof of this, listen to the following
tale:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the hypocritical ascetic.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the bank of the Ganges there is a city named
M&aacute;kandik&aacute;; in that city long ago there was a certain
ascetic who observed a vow of silence, and he lived on alms, and
surrounded by numerous other holy beggars, dwelt in a monastery within
the precincts of a god&rsquo;s temple where he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>taken up his abode. Once, when he entered a
certain merchant&rsquo;s house to beg, he saw a beautiful maiden coming
out with alms in her hand, and the rascal seeing that she was
wonderfully beautiful was smitten with love and exclaimed &ldquo;Ah!
Ah! Alas!&rdquo; And that merchant overheard him. Then taking the alms
he had received, he departed to his own house; and then the merchant
went there and said to him in his astonishment,&mdash;&ldquo;Why did
you to-day suddenly break your vow of silence and say what you
did?&rdquo; When he heard that, the ascetic said to the
merchant&mdash;&ldquo;This daughter of yours has inauspicious marks;
when she marries, you will undoubtedly perish, wife, sons, and all. So,
when I saw her, I was afflicted, for you are my devoted adherent; and
thus it was on your account that I broke silence and said what I did.
So place this daughter of yours by night in a basket, on the top of
which there must be a light, and set her adrift on the Ganges.&rdquo;
The merchant said, &ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; and went away, and at night
he did all he had been directed to do out of pure fear. The timid are
ever unreflecting. The hermit for his part said at that time to his own
pupils, &ldquo;Go to the Ganges, and when you see a basket floating
along with a light on the top of it, bring it here secretly, but you
must not open it, even if you hear a noise inside.&rdquo; They said,
&ldquo;We will do so,&rdquo; and off they went; but before they reached
the Ganges, strange to say, a certain prince went into the river to
bathe. He seeing that basket, which the merchant had thrown in, by the
help of the light on it, got his servants to fetch it for him, and
immediately opened it out of curiosity. And in it he saw that
heart-enchanting girl, and he married her on the spot by the
G&aacute;ndharva ceremony of marriage. And he set the basket adrift on
the Ganges, exactly as it was before, putting a lamp on the top of it,
and placing a fierce monkey inside it. The prince having departed with
that pearl of maidens, the pupils of the hermit came there in the
course of their search, and saw that basket, and took it up and carried
it to the hermit. Then he being delighted, said to them, &ldquo;I will
take this upstairs and perform incantations with it alone, but you must
lie in silence this night.&rdquo; When he had said this, the ascetic
took the basket to the top of the monastery, and opened it, eager to
behold the merchant&rsquo;s daughter. And then a monkey of terrible
appearance sprang out of it,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4171src" href=
"#xd27e4171" name="xd27e4171src">4</a> and rushed upon the ascetic,
like his own immoral conduct incarnate in bodily form. The monkey in
its fury immediately tore off with its teeth the nose of the wicked
ascetic, and his ears with its claws, as if it had been a skilful
executioner; and in that state the ascetic ran downstairs, and when his
pupils beheld him, they could with difficulty suppress their laughter.
And early next morning everybody heard the story, and laughed heartily,
but the merchant was delighted, and his daughter also, as she had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>obtained a good husband. And even as the ascetic
made himself ridiculous, so too may we possibly become a
laughing-stock, if we employ deceit, and fail after all. For the
separation of the king from V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; involves many
disadvantages. When Ruma&#7751;vat had said this to
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, the latter answered; &ldquo;In no other
way can we conduct our enterprise successfully, and if we do not
undertake the enterprise, it is certain that with this self-indulgent
king we shall lose even what territory we have got; and the reputation
which we have acquired for statesmanship will be tarnished, and we
shall cease to be spoken of as men who shew loyalty to their sovereign.
For when a king is one who depends on himself for success, his
ministers are considered merely the instruments of his wisdom; and in
the case of such monarchs you would not have much to do with their
success or failures. But when a king depends on his ministers for
success, it is their wisdom that achieves his ends, and if they are
wanting in enterprise, he must bid a long farewell to all hope of
greatness.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4189src" href="#xd27e4189" name=
"xd27e4189src">5</a> But if you fear the queen&rsquo;s father
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena, I must tell you that he and his son
and the queen also will do whatever I bid them.&rdquo; When
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, most resolute among the resolute, had
said this, Ruma&#7751;vat, whose heart dreaded some fatal blunder,
again said to him; &ldquo;Even a discerning prince is afflicted by the
pain of being separated from a beloved woman, much more will this king
of Vatsa be. In proof of what I say, listen to the following
tale:&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Once on a time there was a king named Devasena, best
of wise men, and the city of &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute; was his
capital. And in that city there was a wealthy merchant, and to him
there was born a daughter of unparalleled beauty. And that daughter
became known by the name of Unm&aacute;din&iacute;, because every one,
who beheld her beauty, became mad. Her father the merchant thought,
&ldquo;I must not give this daughter of mine to any one without telling
the king, or he may be angry.&rdquo; So he went and said to the king
Devasena, &ldquo;King, I have a daughter who is a very pearl, take her
if she finds favour in your eyes.&rdquo; When he heard that, the king
sent some Br&aacute;hmans, his confidential ministers, saying to them,
&ldquo;Go and see if that maiden possesses the auspicious marks or
not.&rdquo; The ministers said, &ldquo;We will do so<span class="corr"
id="xd27e4204" title="Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; and went. But when
they beheld that merchant&rsquo;s daughter, Unm&aacute;din&iacute;,
love was suddenly produced in their souls, and they became utterly
bewildered. When they recovered their senses, the Br&aacute;hmans said
to one another: &ldquo;If the king marries this maiden, he will think
only of her, and will neglect the affairs of the State, and everything
will go to rack and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>ruin; so what is the good of her?&rdquo;
Accordingly they went and told the king, what was not true, that the
maiden had inauspicious marks. Then the merchant gave that
Unm&aacute;din&iacute;, whom the king had refused, and who in her heart
felt a proud resentment at it, to the king&rsquo;s commander-in-chief.
When she was in the house of her husband, she ascended one day to the
roof, and exhibited herself to the king, who she knew would pass that
way. And the moment the king beheld her, resembling a world-bewildering
drug employed by the god of love, distraction seemed to be produced
within him. When he returned to his palace, and discovered that it was
the same lady he had previously rejected, he was full of regret, and
fell violently ill with fever; the commander-in-chief, the husband of
the lady, came to him and earnestly entreated him to take her, saying,
&ldquo;She is a slave, she is not the lawful wife of another, or if it
seem fit, I will repudiate her in the temple, then my lord can take her
for his own.&rdquo; But the king said to him<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e4209" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;I will not take unto
myself another man&rsquo;s wife, and if you repudiate her, your
righteousness will be at end, and you will deserve punishment at my
hands.&rdquo; When they heard that, the other ministers remained
silent, and the king was gradually consumed by love&rsquo;s burning
fever, and so died. So that king perished, though of firm soul, being
deprived of Unm&aacute;din&iacute;; but what will become of the lord of
Vatsa without V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;? When
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a heard this from Ruma&#7751;vat, he
answered; &ldquo;Affliction is bravely endured by kings who have their
eyes firmly fixed on their duty. Did not R&aacute;ma when commissioned
by the gods, who were obliged to resort to that contrivance, to kill
R&aacute;va&#7751;a, endure the pain of separation from queen
S&iacute;t&aacute;? When he heard this, Ruma&#7751;vat said in
answer&mdash;&ldquo;Such as R&aacute;ma are gods, their souls can
endure all things. But the thing is intolerable to men; in proof
whereof listen to the following tale.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the loving couple who died of
separation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on this earth a great city rich in jewels,
named Mathur&aacute;. In it there lived a certain young merchant,
called Illaka. And he had a dear wife whose mind was devoted to him
alone. Once on a time, while he was dwelling with her, the young
merchant determined to go to another country on account of the
exigencies of his affairs. And that wife of his wished to go with him.
For when women are passionately attached to any one, they cannot endure
to be separated from him. And then that young merchant set out, having
offered the usual preliminary prayer for success in his undertaking,
and did not take with him that wife of his, though she had dressed
herself for the journey. She looking after him, when he had started,
with tears in her eyes, stood supporting herself against the panel of
the door of the courtyard. Then, he being out of sight, she was no
longer able to endure her grief; but she was too timid to follow him.
So her breath left her body. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>And as soon as the young merchant
came to know of that, he returned and to his horror found that dear
wife of his a corpse, with pale though lovely complexion, set off by
her waving locks, like the spirit of beauty that tenants the moon
fallen down to the earth in the day during her sleep.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4219src" href="#xd27e4219" name="xd27e4219src">7</a> So he
took her in his arms and wept over her, and immediately the vital
spirits left his body, which was on fire with the flame of grief, as if
they were afraid to remain. So that married couple perished by mutual
separation, and therefore we must take care that the king is not
separated from the queen.&rdquo; When he had said this, Ruma&#7751;vat
ceased, with his mind full of apprehension, but the wise
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, that ocean of calm resolution answered
him; &ldquo;I have arranged the whole plan, and the affairs of kings
often require such steps to be taken, in proof of it, hear the
following tale:&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Pu&#7751;yasena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived long ago in Ujjayin&iacute; a king named
Pu&#7751;yasena, and once on a time a powerful sovereign came and
attacked him. Then his resolute ministers, seeing that that king was
hard to conquer, spread everywhere a false report that their own
sovereign Pu&#7751;yasena was dead; and they placed him in concealment,
and burnt some other man&rsquo;s corpse with all the ceremonies
appropriate to a king, and they proposed to the hostile king through an
ambassador that, as they had now no king, he should come and be their
king. The hostile monarch was pleased and consented, and then the
ministers assembled accompanied by soldiers, and proceeded to storm his
camp. And the enemy&rsquo;s army being destroyed,
Pu&#7751;yasena&rsquo;s ministers brought him out of concealment, and
having recovered their power put that hostile king to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such necessities will arise in monarch&rsquo;s affairs,
therefore let us resolutely accomplish this business of the
king&rsquo;s by spreading a report of the queen&rsquo;s having been
burnt.&rdquo; When he heard this from Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who
had made up his mind, Ruma&#7751;vat said; &ldquo;If this is resolved
upon, let us send for Gop&aacute;laka the queen&rsquo;s respected
brother, and let us take all our measures duly, after consultation with
him.&rdquo; Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a said<span class="corr"
id="xd27e4229" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo;
and Ruma&#7751;vat allowed himself to be guided, in determining what
was to be done, by the confidence which he placed in his colleague. The
next day, these dexterous ministers sent off a messenger of their own
to bring Gop&aacute;laka, on the pretext that his relations longed to
see him. And as he had only departed before on account of urgent
business, Gop&aacute;laka came at the request of the messenger, seeming
like an incarnate festival. And the very day he came,
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a took him by night to his own house
together with Ruma&#7751;vat, and there he told him of that daring
scheme which he wished to undertake, all of which he had before
deliberated about together with that Ruma&#7751;vat; and
Gop&aacute;laka desiring the good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107"
href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>of the king of Vatsa
consented to the scheme though he knew it would bring sorrow to his
sister, for the mind of good men is ever fixed upon duty. Then
Ruma&#7751;vat again said,&mdash;&ldquo;All this is well planned, but
when the king of Vatsa hears that his wife is burnt, he will be
inclined to yield up his breath, and how is he to be prevented from
doing so? This is a matter which ought to be considered. For though all
the usual politic expedients may advantageously be employed, the
principal element of sound state-craft is the averting of
misfortune.&rdquo; Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a who had reflected
on everything that was to be done, said, &ldquo;There need be no
anxiety about this, for the queen is a princess, the younger sister of
Gop&aacute;laka, and dearer to him than his life, and when the king of
Vatsa sees how little afflicted Gop&aacute;laka is, he will think to
himself, &lsquo;Perhaps the queen may be alive after all,&rsquo; and so
will be able to control his feelings. Moreover he is of heroic
disposition, and the marriage of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; will be
quickly got through, and then we can soon bring the queen out of
concealment.&rdquo; Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and
Gop&aacute;laka, and Ruma&#7751;vat having made up their minds to this,
deliberated as follows: &ldquo;Let us adopt the artifice of going to
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka with the king and queen, for that district is a
border-district near the kingdom of Magadha. And because it contains
admirable hunting-grounds, it will tempt the king to absent himself
from the palace, so we can set the women&rsquo;s apartments there on
fire and carry out the plan<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4234src" href=
"#xd27e4234" name="xd27e4234src">8</a> on which we have determined. And
by an artifice we will take the queen and leave her in the palace of
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, in order that Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; herself
may be a witness to the queen&rsquo;s virtuous behaviour in a state of
concealment.&rdquo; Having thus deliberated together during the night,
they all, with Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a at their head, entered the
king&rsquo;s palace on the next day. Then Ruma&#7751;vat made the
following representation to the king, &ldquo;O king, it is a long time
since we have gone to L&aacute;v&aacute;naka, and it is a very
delightful place, moreover you will find capital hunting-grounds there,
and grass for the horses can easily be obtained. And the king of
Magadha, being so near, afflicts all that district. So let us go there
for the sake of defending it, as well as for our own enjoyment.&rdquo;
And the king, when he heard this, having his mind always set on
enjoyment, determined to go to L&aacute;v&aacute;naka together with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. The next day, the journey having been
decided on, and the auspicious hour having been fixed by the
astrologers, suddenly the hermit N&aacute;rada came to visit the
monarch.</p>
<p>He illuminated the region with his splendour, as he descended from
the midst of heaven, and gave a feast to the eyes of all spectators,
seeming as if he were the moon come down out of affection towards his
own descendants.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4242src" href="#xd27e4242"
name="xd27e4242src">9</a> After accepting the usual hospitable
attentions, the hermit graciously gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>to the king, who
bowed humbly before him, a garland from the
P&aacute;rij&aacute;ta<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4247src" href=
"#xd27e4247" name="xd27e4247src">10</a> tree. And he congratulated the
queen, by whom he was politely received, promising her that she should
have a son, who should be a portion of Cupid<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4250src" href="#xd27e4250" name="xd27e4250src">11</a> and king of
all the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And then he said to the king of Vatsa,
while Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a was standing by, &ldquo;O king, the
sight of your wife V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; has strangely brought
something to my recollection. In old time you had for ancestors
Yudhish&#7789;hira and his brothers. And those five had one wife
between them, Draupad&iacute; by name. And she, like
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, was matchless in beauty. Then, fearing that
her beauty would do mischief, I said to them, you must avoid jealousy,
for that is the seed of calamities; in proof of it, listen to the
following tale, which I will relate to you.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Story of Sunda and Upasunda.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were two brothers, Asuras by race, Sunda and
Upasunda, hard to overcome, inasmuch as they surpassed the three worlds
in valour. And Brahm&aacute;, wishing to destroy them, gave an order to
Vi&#347;vakarman,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4269src" href="#xd27e4269"
name="xd27e4269src">13</a> and had constructed a heavenly woman named
Tilottam&aacute;, in order to behold whose beauty even &#346;iva truly
became four-faced, so as to look four ways at once, while she was
devoutly circumambulating him. She, by the order of Brahm&aacute;, went
to Sunda and Upasunda, while they were in the garden of Kail&aacute;sa,
in order to seduce them. And both those two Asuras distracted with
love, seized the fair one at the same time by both her arms, the moment
they saw her near them. And as they were dragging her off in mutual
opposition, they soon came to blows, and both of them were destroyed.
To whom is not the attractive object called woman the cause of
misfortune? And you, though many, have one love, Draupad&iacute;,
therefore you must without fail avoid quarrelling about her. And by my
advice always observe this rule with respect to her. When she is with
the eldest, she must be considered a mother by the younger, and when
she is with the youngest, she must be considered a daughter-in-law by
the eldest. Your ancestors, O king, accepted that speech of mine with
unanimous consent, having their minds fixed on salutary counsels. And
they were my friends, and it is through love for them that I have come
to visit you here, king of Vatsa, therefore I give you this advice. Do
you follow the counsel of your ministers, as they followed mine, and in
a short time you will gain great success. For some time you will suffer
grief, but you must not be too much distressed about it, for it will
end in happiness.&rdquo; After the hermit N&aacute;rada, so clever in
indirectly intimating future prosperity, had said this duly to the king
of Vatsa, he immediately disappeared. And then
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

it into effect.</p>

<p class="first">Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and the other
ministers managed to conduct the king of Vatsa with his beloved, by the
above-mentioned stratagem, to L&aacute;v&aacute;naka. The king arrived
at that place, which, by the roar of the host echoing through it,
seemed, as it were, to proclaim that the ministers&rsquo; object would
be successfully attained. And the king of Magadha, when he heard that
the lord of Vatsa had arrived there with a large following, trembled,
anticipating attack. But he being wise, sent an ambassador to
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and that excellent minister well-versed
in his duties, received him gladly. The king of Vatsa for his part,
while staying in that place, ranged every day the wide-extended forest
for the sake of sport. One day, the king having gone to hunt, the wise
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a accompanied by Gop&aacute;laka, having
arranged what was to be done, and taking with him also Ruma&#7751;vat
and Vasantaka, went secretly to the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;,
who bowed at their approach. There he used various representations to
persuade her to assist in furthering the king&rsquo;s interests, though
she had been previously informed of the whole affair by her brother.
And she agreed to the proposal, though it inflicted on her the pain of
separation. What indeed is there which women of good family, who are
attached to their husbands, will not endure? Thereupon the skilful
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a made her assume the appearance of a
Br&aacute;hman woman, having given her a charm, which enabled her to
change her shape. And he made Vasantaka one-eyed and like a
Br&aacute;hman boy, and as for himself, he in the same way assumed the
appearance of an old Br&aacute;hman. Then that mighty-minded one took
the queen, after she had assumed that appearance, and accompanied by
Vasantaka, set out leisurely for the town of Magadha. And so
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; left her house, and went in bodily presence
along the road, though she wandered in spirit to her husband. Then
Ruma&#7751;vat burnt her pavilion with fire, and exclaimed
aloud&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! alas! The queen and Vasantaka are
burnt.&rdquo; And so in that place there rose to heaven at the same
time flames and lamentation; the flames gradually subsided, not so the
sound of weeping. Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Vasantaka reached the city of the king of
Magadha, and seeing the princess Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; in the garden,
he went up to her with those two, though the guards tried to prevent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>him. And Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, when she saw
the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; in the dress of a Br&aacute;hman
woman, fell in love with her at first sight. The princess ordered the
guards to desist from their opposition, and had
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who was disguised as a Br&aacute;hman,
conducted into her presence. And she addressed to him this question,
&ldquo;Great Br&aacute;hman, who is this girl you have with you, and
why are you come?&rdquo; And he answered her, &ldquo;Princess, this is
my daughter &Aacute;vantik&aacute; by name, and her husband, being
addicted to vice,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4281src" href="#xd27e4281"
name="xd27e4281src">1</a> has deserted her and fled somewhere or other.
So I will leave her in your care, illustrious lady, while I go and find
her husband, and bring him back, which will be in a short time. And let
this one-eyed boy, her brother, remain here near her, in order that she
may not be grieved at having to remain alone.&rdquo; He said this to
the princess, and she granted his request, and, taking leave of the
queen, the good minister quickly returned to L&aacute;v&aacute;naka.
Then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; took with her V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;,
who was passing under the name of &Aacute;vantik&aacute;, and Vasantaka
who accompanied her in the form of a one-eyed boy; and shewing her
excellent disposition by her kind reception and affectionate treatment
of them, entered her splendidly-adorned palace; and there
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, seeing <span class="corr" id="xd27e4287"
title="Source: Sit&aacute;">S&iacute;t&aacute;</span> in the history of
R&aacute;ma represented upon the painted walls, was enabled to bear her
own sorrow. And Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; perceived that
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; was a person of very high rank, by her shape,
her delicate softness, the graceful manner in which she sat down, and
ate, and also by the smell of her body, which was fragrant as the blue
lotus, and so she entertained her with luxurious comfort to her
heart&rsquo;s content, even such as she enjoyed herself. And she
thought to herself, &ldquo;Surely she is some distinguished person
remaining here in concealment; did not Draupad&iacute; remain concealed
in the palace of the king of Vir&aacute;&#7789;a?&rdquo; Then
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, out of regard for the princess made for her
unfading garlands and forehead-streaks, as the king of Vatsa had
previously taught her; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;&rsquo;s mother,
seeing her adorned with them, asked her privately who had made those
garlands and streaks. Then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; said to her,
&ldquo;There is dwelling here in my house a certain lady of the name of
&Aacute;vantik&aacute;, she made all these for me.&rdquo; When her
mother heard that, she said to her, then, my daughter, she is not a
woman, she is some goddess, since she possesses such knowledge; gods
and also hermits remain in the houses of good people for the sake of
deluding them, and in proof of this listen to the following
anecdote.</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Kunt&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king named <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e4295" title="Source: Kuntibhoga">Kuntibhoja</span>; and a hermit
of the name of Durv&aacute;sas, who was exceedingly fond of deluding
people, came and stayed in his palace. He commissioned his own daughter
Kunt&iacute; to attend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>upon the hermit, and she
diligently waited upon him. And one day he, wishing to prove her, said
to her, &ldquo;Cook boiled rice with milk and sugar quickly, while I
bathe, and then I will come and eat it.&rdquo; The sage said this, and
bathed quickly, and then he came to eat it, and Kunt&iacute; brought
him the vessel full of that food; and then the hermit, knowing that it
was almost red-hot with the heated rice, and seeing that she could not
hold it in her hands,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4300src" href=
"#xd27e4300" name="xd27e4300src">2</a> cast a look at the back of
Kunt&iacute; and she perceiving what was passing in the hermit&rsquo;s
mind, placed the vessel on her back; then he ate to his heart&rsquo;s
content while Kunt&iacute;&rsquo;s back was being burnt, and because,
though she was terribly burnt, she stood without being at all
discomposed, the hermit was much pleased with her conduct, and after he
had eaten granted her a boon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the hermit remained there, and in the same way this
&Aacute;vantik&aacute;, who is now staying in your palace, is some
distinguished person, therefore endeavour to conciliate her.&rdquo;
When she heard this from the mouth of her mother,
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; showed the utmost consideration for
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who was living disguised in her palace. And
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; for her part, being separated from her lord,
remained there pale with bereavement, like a lotus in the
night.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4311src" href="#xd27e4311" name=
"xd27e4311src">3</a> But the various boyish grimaces, which Vasantaka
exhibited,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4314src" href="#xd27e4314" name=
"xd27e4314src">4</a> again and again called a smile into her face.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king of Vatsa, who had wandered away into very
distant hunting-grounds, returned late in the evening to
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka. And there he saw the women&rsquo;s apartments
reduced to ashes by fire, and heard from his ministers that the queen
was burnt with Vasantaka. And when he heard it, he fell on the ground,
and he was robbed of his senses by unconsciousness, that seemed to
desire to remove the painful sense of grief. But in a moment he came to
himself and was burnt with sorrow in his heart, as if penetrated with
the fire that strove to consume<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4319src"
href="#xd27e4319" name="xd27e4319src">5</a> the image of the queen
imprinted there. Then overpowered with sorrow he lamented, and thought
of nothing but suicide; but a moment after he began to reflect, calling
to mind the following prediction&mdash;&ldquo;From this queen shall be
born a son who shall reign over all the Vidy&aacute;dharas. This is
what the hermit N&aacute;rada told me, and it cannot be false. Moreover
that same hermit warned me that I should have sorrow for some time. And
the affliction of Gop&aacute;laka seems to be but slight. Besides I
cannot detect any excessive grief in Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and
the other ministers, therefore I suspect the queen may possibly be
alive. But the ministers may in this matter have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>employed a certain amount of politic artifice,
therefore I may some day be re-united with the queen. So I see an end
to this affliction.&rdquo; Thus reflecting and being exhorted by his
ministers, the king established in his heart self-control. And
Gop&aacute;laka sent off a private messenger immediately, without any
one&rsquo;s knowing of it, to his sister, to comfort her, with an exact
report of the state of affairs. Such being the situation in
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka, the spies of the king of Magadha who were
there, went off to him and told him all. The king who was ever ready to
seize the opportune moment, when he heard this, was once more anxious
to give to the king of Vatsa his daughter Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, who
had before been asked in marriage by his ministers. Then he
communicated his wishes with respect to this matter to the king of
Vatsa, and also to Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a. And by the advice of
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, the king of Vatsa accepted that proposal,
thinking to himself that perhaps this was the very reason why the queen
had been concealed. Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a quickly
ascertained an auspicious moment, and sent to the sovereign of Magadha
an ambassador with an answer to his proposal which ran as follows:
&ldquo;Thy desire is approved by us, so on the seventh day from this,
the king of Vatsa will arrive at thy court to marry
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, in order that he may quickly forget
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.&rdquo; This was the message which the great
minister sent to that king. And that ambassador conveyed it to the king
of Magadha, who received him joyfully. Then the lord of Magadha made
such preparations for the joyful occasion of the marriage, as were in
accordance with his love for his daughter, his own desire, and his
wealth; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; was delighted at hearing that she
had obtained the bridegroom she desired, but, when
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; heard that news, she was depressed in spirit.
That intelligence, when it reached her ear, changed the colour of her
face, and assisted the transformation effected by her disguise. But
Vasantaka said, &ldquo;In this way an enemy will be turned into a
friend, and your husband will not be alienated from you.&rdquo; This
speech of <span class="corr" id="xd27e4327" title=
"Source: Vasantaka&rsquo;s">Vasantaka</span> consoled her like a
<i>confidante</i>, and enabled her to bear up. Then the discreet lady
again prepared for Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; unfading garlands and
forehead-streaks, both of heavenly beauty, as her marriage was now nigh
at hand; and when the seventh day from that arrived, the monarch of
Vatsa actually came there with his troops, accompanied by his
ministers, to marry her. How could he in his state of bereavement have
ever thought of undertaking such a thing, if he had not hoped in that
way to recover the queen? And the king of Magadha immediately came with
great delight to meet him, (who was a feast to the eyes of the
king&rsquo;s subjects,) as the sea advances to meet the rising moon.
Then the monarch of Vatsa entered the city of the king of Magadha, and
at the same time great joy entered the minds of the citizens on every
side. There the women beheld him fascinating<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4333src" href="#xd27e4333" name="xd27e4333src">6</a> the mind,
though his frame was attenuated from bereavement, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>looking like the god of love, deprived of his
wife Rati. Then the king of Vatsa entered the palace of the lord of
Magadha, and proceeded to the chamber prepared for the marriage
ceremony, which was full of women whose husbands were still alive. In
that chamber he beheld Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; adorned for the wedding,
surpassing with the full moon of her face the circle of the full moon.
And seeing that she had garlands and forehead-streaks such as he
himself only could make, the king could not help wondering where she
got them. Then he ascended the raised platform of the altar, and his
taking her hand there was a commencement of his taking the
tribute<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4339src" href="#xd27e4339" name=
"xd27e4339src">7</a> of the whole earth. The smoke of the altar dimmed
his eyes with tears, as supposing that he could not bear to witness the
ceremony, since he loved V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; so much. Then the
face of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, reddened with circumambulating the
fire, appeared as if full of anger on account of her perceiving what
was passing in her husband&rsquo;s mind. When the ceremony of marriage
was completed, the king of Vatsa let the hand of
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; quit his, but he never even for a moment
allowed the image of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; to be absent from his
heart. Then the king of Magadha gave him jewels in such abundance, that
the earth seemed to be deprived of her gems, they all having been
extracted. And Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, calling the fire to
witness on that occasion, made the king of Magadha undertake never to
injure his master. So that festive scene proceeded, with the
distribution of garments and ornaments, with the songs of excellent
minstrels, and the dancing of dancing-girls. In the meanwhile
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; remained unobserved, hoping for the glory of
her husband, appearing<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4344src" href=
"#xd27e4344" name="xd27e4344src">8</a> to be asleep, like the beauty of
the moon in the day. Then the king of Vatsa went to the women&rsquo;s
apartments, and the skilful Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, being afraid
that he would see the queen, and that so the whole secret would be
divulged, said to the sovereign of Magadha, &ldquo;Prince, this very
day the king of Vatsa will set forth from thy house.&rdquo; The king of
Magadha consented to it, and then the minister made the very same
announcement to the king of Vatsa, and he also approved of it.</p>
<p>Then the king of Vatsa set out from that place, after his attendants
had eaten and drunk, together with his ministers, escorting his bride
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. And V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, ascending a
comfortable carriage sent by Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, with its great
horses also put at her disposal by her, went secretly in the rear of
the army, making the transformed Vasantaka precede her. At last the
king of Vatsa reached L&aacute;v&aacute;naka, and entered his own
house, together with his bride, but thought all the time only of the
queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. The queen also arrived and entered the
house of Gop&aacute;laka at night, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>making the chamberlains wait
round it. There she saw her brother Gop&aacute;laka who shewed her
great attention, and she embraced his neck weeping, while his eyes
filled with tears; and at that moment arrived
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, true to his previous agreement, together
with Ruma&#7751;vat, and the queen shewed him all due courtesy. And
while he was engaged in dispelling the queen&rsquo;s grief caused by
the great effort she had made, and her separation from her husband,
those chamberlains repaired to Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and said,
&ldquo;Queen, &Aacute;vantik&aacute; has arrived, but she has in a
strange way dismissed us, and gone to the house of prince
Gop&aacute;laka.&rdquo; When Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; heard that
representation from her chamberlains, she was alarmed and in the
presence of the king of Vatsa answered them, &ldquo;Go and say to
&Aacute;vantik&aacute;, &lsquo;The queen says&mdash;You are a deposit
in my hands, so what business have you where you are? Come where I
am.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When they heard that, they departed and the
king asked Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; in private who made for her the
unfading garlands and forehead-streaks. Then she said, &ldquo;It is all
the product of the great artistic skill of the lady named
&Aacute;vantik&aacute; who was deposited in my house by a certain
Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo; No sooner did the king hear that, then he went
off to the house of Gop&aacute;laka, thinking that surely
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; would be there. And he entered the house, at
the door of which eunuchs were standing,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4357src" href="#xd27e4357" name="xd27e4357src">9</a> and within
which were the queen, Gop&aacute;laka, the two ministers, and
Vasantaka. There he saw V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; returned from
banishment, like the orb of the moon freed from its eclipse. Then he
fell on the earth delirious with the poison of grief, and trembling was
produced in the heart of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. Then she too fell
on the earth with limbs pale from separation, and lamented aloud,
blaming her own conduct. And that couple, afflicted with grief,
lamented so that even the face of Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a was
washed with tears. And then Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; too heard that
wailing, which seemed so little suited to the occasion, and came in a
state of bewilderment to the place whence it proceeded. And gradually
finding out the truth with respect to the king and
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, she was reduced to the same state, for good
women are affectionate and tender-hearted. And
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; frequently exclaimed with tears, &ldquo;What
profit is there in my life that causes only sorrow to my
husband?&rdquo; Then the calm Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a said to the
king of Vatsa: &ldquo;King, I have done all this in order to make you
universal emperor, by marrying you to the daughter of the sovereign of
Magadha, and the queen is not in the slightest degree to blame;
moreover this, her rival wife, is witness to her good behaviour during
her absence from you.&rdquo; Thereupon Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, whose
mind was free from jealousy, said, &ldquo;I am ready to enter the fire
on the spot to prove her innocence.&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;I
am in fault, as it was for my sake that the queen endured this great
affliction.&rdquo; And V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; having firmly
resolved, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;I must enter the fire to clear from
suspicion the mind of the king.&rdquo; Then the wise
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, best of right-acting men, rinsed his
mouth, with his face towards the east, and spoke a blameless speech;
&ldquo;If I have been a benefactor to this king, and if the queen is
free from stain, speak, ye guardians of the world; if it is not so, I
will part from my body.&rdquo; Thus he spoke and ceased, and this
heavenly utterance was heard: &ldquo;Happy art thou, O king, that hast
for minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and for wife
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who in a former birth was a goddess; not the
slightest blame attaches to her.&rdquo; Having uttered this, the Voice
ceased. All who were present, when they heard that sound, which
resounded though all the regions, delightful as the deep thunder-roar
at the first coming of the rain-clouds, having endured affliction for a
long time, lifted up their hands and plainly imitated peafowl in their
joy. Moreover the king of Vatsa and Gop&aacute;laka praised that
proceeding of Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s, and the former
already considered that the whole earth was subject to him. Then that
king possessing those two wives, whose affection was every day
increased by living with him, like joy and tranquillity come to visit
him in bodily form, was in a state of supreme felicity.</p>

<p class="first">The next day, the king of Vatsa, sitting in private
with V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, engaged in
a festive banquet, sent for Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a,
Gop&aacute;laka, Ruma&#7751;vat and Vasantaka, and had much
confidential conversation with them. Then the king, in the hearing of
them all, told the following tale with reference to the subject of his
separation from his beloved.</p>

<p class="first">Once on a time there was a king of the name of
Pur&uacute;ravas, who was a devoted worshipper of Vish&#7751;u; he
traversed heaven as well as earth without opposition, and one day, as
he was sauntering in Nandana, the garden of the gods, a certain Apsaras
of the name of Urva&#347;&iacute;, who was a second <span class="corr"

weapon<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4383src" href="#xd27e4383" name=
"xd27e4383src">2</a> in the hands of Love, cast an eye upon him. The
moment she beheld him, the sight so completely robbed her of her
senses, that she alarmed the timid minds of Rambh&aacute; and her other
friends. The king too, when he saw that torrent of the nectar of
beauty, was quite faint with thirst, because he could not obtain
possession of her. Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>Vish&#7751;u, who knoweth all,
dwelling in the sea of milk, gave the following command to
N&aacute;rada, an excellent hermit, who came to visit
him&mdash;&ldquo;O Divine sage,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4388src"
href="#xd27e4388" name="xd27e4388src">3</a> the king Pur&uacute;ravas,
at present abiding in the garden of Nandana, having had his mind
captivated by Urva&#347;&iacute;, remains incapable of bearing the pain
of separation from his love. Therefore go, O hermit, and informing
Indra as from me, cause that Urva&#347;&iacute; to be quickly given to
the king.&rdquo; Having received this order from Vish&#7751;u,
N&aacute;rada undertook to execute it, and going to Pur&uacute;ravas
who was in the state described, roused him from his lethargy and said
to him;&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, O king, for thy sake I am sent here by
Vish&#7751;u, for that god does not neglect the sufferings of those who
are unfeignedly devoted to him.&rdquo; With these words, the hermit
N&aacute;rada cheered up Pur&uacute;ravas, and then went with him into
the presence of the king of the gods.</p>
<p>Then he communicated the order of Vish&#7751;u to Indra, who
received it with reverent mind, and so the hermit caused
Urva&#347;&iacute; to be given to Pur&uacute;ravas. That gift of
Urva&#347;&iacute; deprived the inhabitants of heaven of life, but it
was to Urva&#347;&iacute; herself an elixir to restore her to life.
Then Pur&uacute;ravas returned with her to the earth, exhibiting to the
eyes of mortals the wonderful spectacle of a heavenly bride.
Thenceforth those two, Urva&#347;&iacute; and that king, remained, so
to speak, fastened together by the leash of gazing on one another, so
that they were unable to separate. One day Pur&uacute;ravas went to
heaven, invited by Indra to assist him, as a war had arisen between him
and the D&aacute;navas. In that war the king of the Asuras, named
M&aacute;y&aacute;dhara, was slain, and accordingly Indra held a great
feast, at which all the nymphs of heaven displayed their skill. And on
that occasion Pur&uacute;ravas, when he saw the nymph Rambh&aacute;
performing a dramatic dance called <i>chalita</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4396src" href="#xd27e4396" name="xd27e4396src">4</a> with the
teacher Tumburu standing by her, laughed. Then Rambh&aacute; said to
him sarcastically&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose, mortal, you know this
heavenly dance, do you not?&rdquo; Pur&uacute;ravas answered,
&ldquo;From associating with Urva&#347;&iacute;, I knew dances which
even your teacher Tumburu does not know.&rdquo; When Tumburu heard
that, he laid this curse on him in his wrath, &ldquo;Mayest thou be
separated from Urva&#347;&iacute; until thou propitiate <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e4399" title=
"Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span>.&rdquo; When he
heard that curse, Pur&uacute;ravas went and told Urva&#347;&iacute;
what had happened to him, which was terrible as &ldquo;a thunderbolt
from the blue.&rdquo; Immediately some Gandharvas swooped down, without
the king&rsquo;s seeing them, and carried off Urva&#347;&iacute;,
whither he knew not. Then Pur&uacute;ravas, knowing that the calamity
was due to that curse, went and performed penance to appease
Vish&#7751;u in the hermitage of Badarik&aacute;.</p>
<p>But Urva&#347;&iacute;, remaining in the country of the Gandharvas,
afflicted at her separation, was as void of sense as if she had been
dead, asleep, or a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>mere picture. She kept herself alive with
hoping for the end of the curse, but it is wonderful that she did not
lose her hold on life, while she remained like the female
<i>chakrav&aacute;ka</i> during the night, the appointed time of her
separation from the male bird. And Pur&uacute;ravas propitiated
Vish&#7751;u by that penance, and, owing to Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s having
been gratified, the Gandharvas surrendered Urva&#347;&iacute; to him.
So that king, re-united to the nymph whom he had recovered at the
termination of the curse, enjoyed heavenly pleasures, though living
upon earth.</p>
<p>The king stopped speaking, and V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; felt an
emotion of shame at having endured separation, when she heard of the
attachment of Urva&#347;&iacute; to her husband.</p>
<p>Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, seeing that the queen was abashed
at having been indirectly reproved by her husband, said, in order to
make him feel in his turn,&mdash;&ldquo;King, listen to this tale, if
you have not already heard it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Vihitasena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on this earth a city of the name of
Timir&aacute;, the dwelling of the goddess of Prosperity; in it there
was a famous king named Vihitasena; he had a wife named
Tejovat&iacute;, a very goddess upon earth. That king was ever hanging
on her neck, devoted to her embraces, and could not even bear that his
body should be for a short time scratched with the coat of mail. And
once there came upon the king a lingering fever with diminishing
intensity; and the physicians <span class="corr" id="xd27e4418" title=
"Source: forbad">forbade</span> him to continue in the queen&rsquo;s
society. But when he was excluded from the society of the queen, there
was engendered in his heart a disease not to be reached by medicine or
treatment. The physicians told the ministers in private that the
disease might relieve itself by fear or the stroke of some affliction.
The ministers reflected&mdash;&ldquo;How can we produce fear in that
brave king, who did not tremble when an enormous snake once fell on his
back, who was not confused when a hostile army penetrated into his
harem? It is useless thinking of devices to produce fear; what are we
ministers, to do with the king?&rdquo; Thus the ministers reflected,
and after deliberating with the queen, concealed her, and said to the
king, &ldquo;The queen is dead.&rdquo; While the king was tortured with
that exceeding grief, in his agitation that disease in his heart
relieved itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4421src" href="#xd27e4421"
name="xd27e4421src">5</a> When the king had got over the pain of the
illness, the ministers restored to him that great queen, who seemed
like a second gift of ease, and the king valued her highly as the
saviour of his life, and was too wise to bear anger against her
afterwards for concealing herself.</p>
<p>For it is care for a husband&rsquo;s interests that entitles a
king&rsquo;s wife to the name of queen; by mere compliance with a
husband&rsquo;s whims the name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>of queen is not obtained. And
discharging the duty of minister means undivided attention to the
burden of the king&rsquo;s affairs, but the compliance with a
king&rsquo;s passing fancies is the characteristic of a mere courtier.
Accordingly we made this effort in order to come to terms with your
enemy, the king of Magadha, and with a view to your conquering the
whole earth. So it is not the case that the queen, who, through love
for you, endured intolerable separation, has done you a wrong; on the
contrary she has conferred on you a great benefit.&rdquo; When the king
of Vatsa heard this true speech of his prime-minister&rsquo;s, he
thought that he himself was in the wrong, and was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>And he said; &ldquo;I know this well enough, that the queen, like
Policy incarnate in bodily form, acting under your inspiration, has
bestowed upon me the dominion of the earth. But that unbecoming speech,
which I uttered, was due to excessive affection; how can people whose
minds are blinded with love bring themselves to deliberate
calmly?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4433src" href="#xd27e4433" name=
"xd27e4433src">6</a>&rdquo; With such conversation that king of Vatsa
brought the day and the queen&rsquo;s eclipse of shame to an end. On
the next day a messenger sent by the king of Magadha, who had
discovered the real state of the case, came to the sovereign of Vatsa,
and said to him as from his master; &ldquo;We have been deceived by thy
ministers, therefore take such steps as that the world may not
henceforth be to us a place of misery.&rdquo; When he heard that, the
king shewed all honour to the messenger, and sent him to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; to take his answer from her. She, for her part,
being altogether devoted to V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, had an interview
with the ambassador in her presence. For humility is an unfailing
characteristic of good women. The ambassador delivered her
father&rsquo;s message&mdash;&ldquo;My daughter, you have been married
by an artifice, and your husband is attached to another, thus it has
come to pass that I reap in misery the fruit of being the father of a
daughter.&rdquo; But Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; thus answered him, Say to
my father from me here&mdash;&ldquo;What need of grief? For my husband
is very indulgent to me, and the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; is my
affectionate sister, so my father must not be angry with my husband,
unless he wishes to break his own plighted faith and my heart at the
same time.&rdquo; When this becoming answer had been given by
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; hospitably
entertained the ambassador and then sent him away. When the ambassador
had departed, Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; remained somewhat depressed with
regret, calling to mind her father&rsquo;s house. Then
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; ordered Vasantaka to amuse her, and he came
near, and with that object proceeded to tell the following tale:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Somaprabh&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city, the ornament of the earth, called
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and in it there was a great merchant named
Dharmagupta. He had a wife named <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>Chandraprabh&aacute;, and she
once on a time became pregnant, and brought forth a daughter beautiful
in all her limbs. That girl, the moment she was born, illuminated the
chamber with her beauty, spoke distinctly,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4443src" href="#xd27e4443" name="xd27e4443src">7</a> and got up
and sat down. Then Dharmagupta, seeing that the women in the
lying-in-chamber were astonished and terrified, went there himself in a
state of alarm. And immediately he asked that girl in secret, bowing
before her humbly,&mdash;&ldquo;Adorable one, who art thou, that art
thus become incarnate in my family?&rdquo; She answered him,
&ldquo;Thou must not give me in marriage to any one; as long as I
remain in thy house, father, I am a blessing to thee; what profit is
there in enquiring further?&rdquo; When she said this to him,
Dharmagupta was frightened, and he concealed her in his house giving
out abroad that she was dead. Then that girl, whose name was
Somaprabh&aacute; gradually grew up with human body, but celestial
splendour of beauty. And one day a young merchant, of the name of
Guhachandra, beheld her, as she was standing upon the top of her
palace, looking on with delight at the celebration of the
spring-festival; she clung like a creeper of love round his heart, so
that he was, as it were, faint, and with difficulty got home to his
house. There he was tortured with the pain of love, and when his
parents persistently importuned him to tell them the cause of his
distress, he informed them by the mouth of a friend. Then his father,
whose name was Guhasena, out of love for his son, went to the house of
Dharmagupta, to ask him to give his daughter in marriage to
Guhachandra. Then Dharmagupta put off Guhasena when he made the
request, desiring to obtain a daughter-in-law, and said to him,
&ldquo;The fact is, my daughter is out of her mind.&rdquo; Considering
that he meant by that to refuse to give his daughter, Guhasena returned
home, and there he beheld his son prostrated by the fever of love, and
thus reflected, &ldquo;I will persuade the king to move in this matter,
for I have before this conferred an obligation on him, and he will
cause that maiden to be given to my son, who is at the point of
death.&rdquo; Having thus determined, the merchant went and presented
to the king a splendid jewel, and made known to him his desire. The
king, for his part, being well-disposed towards him, commissioned the
head of the police to assist him, with whom he went to the house of
Dharmagupta; and surrounded it on all sides with policemen,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4454src" href="#xd27e4454" name="xd27e4454src">8</a>
so that Dharmagupta&rsquo;s throat was choked with tears, as he
expected utter ruin. Then Somaprabh&aacute; said to
Dharmagupta&mdash;&ldquo;Give me in marriage, my father, let not
calamity befall you on my account, but I must never be treated as a
wife by my husband, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>and this agreement you must make in express
terms with my future father-in-law.&rdquo; When his daughter had said
this to him. Dharmagupta agreed to give her in marriage, after
stipulating that she should not be treated as a wife; and Guhasena with
inward laughter agreed to the condition, thinking to himself,
&ldquo;Only let my son be once married.&rdquo; Then Guhachandra, the
son of Guhasena, went to his own house, taking with him his bride
Somaprabh&aacute;. And in the evening his father said to him, &ldquo;My
son, treat her as a wife, for who abstains from the society of his own
wife?&rdquo; When she heard that, the bride Somaprabh&aacute; looked
angrily at her father-in-law, and whirled round her threatening
fore-finger, as it were the decree of death. When he saw that finger of
his daughter-in-law, the breath of that merchant immediately left him,
and fear came upon all besides. But Guhachandra, when his father was
dead, thought to himself, &ldquo;The goddess of death has entered into
my house as a wife.&rdquo; And thenceforth he avoided the society of
that wife, though she remained in his house, and so observed a vow
difficult as that of standing on the edge of a sword. And being inly
consumed by that grief, losing his taste for all enjoyment, he made a
vow and feasted Br&aacute;hmans every day. And that wife of his, of
heavenly beauty, observing strict silence, used always to give a fee to
those Br&aacute;hmans after they had eaten. One day an aged
Br&aacute;hman, who had come to be fed, beheld her exciting the wonder
of the world by her dower of beauty; then the Br&aacute;hman full of
curiosity secretly asked Guhachandra; &ldquo;Tell me who this young
wife of yours is.&rdquo; Then Guhachandra, being importuned by that
Br&aacute;hman, told him with afflicted mind her whole story. When he
heard it, the excellent Br&aacute;hman, full of compassion, gave him a
charm for appeasing the fire, in order that he might obtain his desire.
Accordingly, while Guhachandra was in secret muttering that charm,
there appeared to him a Br&aacute;hman from the midst of the fire. And
that god of fire in the shape of a Br&aacute;hman, said to him, as he
lay prostrate at his feet, &ldquo;To-day I will eat in thy house, and I
will remain there during the night. And after I have shewn thee the
truth with respect to thy wife, I will accomplish thy desire.&rdquo;
When he had said this to Guhachandra, the Br&aacute;hman entered his
house. There he ate like the other Br&aacute;hmans, and lay down at
night near Guhachandra for one watch of the night only, such was his
unwearying zeal. And at this period of the night, Somaprabh&aacute;,
the wife of Guhachandra, went out from the house of her husband, all
the inmates of which were asleep. At that moment that Br&aacute;hman
woke up Guhachandra, and said to him, &ldquo;Come, see what thy wife is
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by magic power he gave Guhachandra and himself the shape of
bees,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4464src" href="#xd27e4464" name=
"xd27e4464src">9</a> and going out he shewed him that wife of his, who
had issued from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the house. And that fair one went a long
distance outside the city, and the Br&aacute;hman with Guhachandra
followed her. Thereupon Guhachandra saw before him a Nyagrodha<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4475src" href="#xd27e4475" name=
"xd27e4475src">10</a> tree of wide extent, beautiful with its shady
stem, and under it he heard a heavenly sound of singing, sweet with
strains floating on the air, accompanied with the music of the lyre and
the flute. And on the trunk of the tree he saw a heavenly
maiden<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4478src" href="#xd27e4478" name=
"xd27e4478src">11</a>, like his wife in appearance, seated on a
splendid throne, eclipsing by her beauty the moon-beam, fanned with
white <i>chowries</i>, like the goddess presiding over the treasure of
all the moon&rsquo;s beauty. And then Guhachandra saw his wife ascend
that very tree and sit down beside that lady, occupying half of her
throne. While he was contemplating those two heavenly maidens of equal
beauty sitting together, it seemed to him as if that night were lighted
by three moons.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4490src" href="#xd27e4490"
name="xd27e4490src">12</a></p>
<p>Then he, full of curiosity<span class="corr" id="xd27e4495" title=
"Source: thought,">, thought</span> for a moment, &ldquo;Can this be
sleep or delusion? But away with both these suppositions! This is the
expanding of the blossom from the bud of association with the wise,
which springs on the tree of right conduct, and this blossom gives
promise of the appropriate fruit.&rdquo; While he was thus reflecting
at his leisure, those two celestial maidens, after eating food suited
for such as they were, drank heavenly wine. Then the wife of
Guhachandra said to the second heavenly maiden, &ldquo;To-day some
glorious Br&aacute;hman has arrived in our house, for which reason, my
sister, my heart is alarmed and I must go.&rdquo; In these words she
took leave of that other heavenly maiden and descended from the tree.
When Guhachandra and the Br&aacute;hman saw that, they returned in
front of her, still preserving the form of bees, and arrived in the
house by night before she did, and afterwards arrived that heavenly
maiden, the wife of Guhachandra, and she entered the house without
being observed. Then that Br&aacute;hman of his own accord said to
Guhachandra; &ldquo;You have had ocular proof that your wife is divine
and not human, and you have to-day seen her sister who is also divine;
and how do you suppose that a heavenly nymph can desire the society of
a man? So I will give you a charm to be written up over her door, and I
will also teach you an artifice to be employed outside the house, which
must increase the force of the charm. A fire burns even without being
fanned, but much more when a strong current of air is brought to bear
on it; in the same way a charm will produce the desired effect unaided,
but much more readily when assisted by an artifice.&rdquo; When he had
said this, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>the excellent Br&aacute;hman gave a charm to
Guhachandra, and instructed him in the artifice, and then vanished in
the dawn. Guhachandra for his part wrote it up over the door of his
wife&rsquo;s apartment, and in the evening had recourse to the
following stratagem calculated to excite her affection. He dressed
himself splendidly and went and conversed with a certain
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> before her eyes. When she saw this, the heavenly
maiden being jealous, called to him with voice set free by the charm,
and asked him who that woman was<span class="corr" id="xd27e4503"
title="Source: ?">.</span> He answered her falsely; &ldquo;She is a
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> who has taken a fancy to me, and I shall go and pay
her a visit to-day.&rdquo; Then she looked at him askance with wrinkled
brows, and lifting up her veil with her left hand, said to him,
&ldquo;Ah! I see: this is why you are dressed so grandly, do not go to
her, what have you to do with her? Visit me, for I am your wife.&rdquo;
When he had been thus implored by her, agitated with excitement, as if
she were possessed, though that evil demon which held her had been
expelled by the charm, he was in a state of ecstatic joy, and he
immediately entered into her chamber with her, and enjoyed, though a
mortal, celestial happiness not conceived of in imagination. Having
thus obtained her as a loving wife, conciliated by the magic power of
the charm, who abandoned for him her celestial rank, Guhachandra lived
happily ever after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus heavenly nymphs, who have been cast down by some curse,
live as wives in the houses of righteous men, as a reward for their
good deeds, such as acts of devotion and charity. For the honouring of
gods and Br&aacute;hmans is considered the wishing-cow<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4511src" href="#xd27e4511" name=
"xd27e4511src">13</a> of the good. For what is not obtained by that?
All the other politic expedients, known as conciliation and so on, are
mere adjuncts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4517src" href="#xd27e4517"
name="xd27e4517src">14</a> But evil actions are the chief cause of even
heavenly beings, born in a very lofty station, falling from their high
estate; as a hurricane is the cause of the falling of blossoms.&rdquo;
When he had said this to the princess, Vasantaka continued; &ldquo;Hear
moreover what happened to Ahaly&aacute;.&rdquo;</p>

"pb123">123</a>]</span>assumed, out of fear, the form of a cat. Then
Gautama said to Ahaly&aacute;; &ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo; She answered
her husband ambiguously in the Pr&aacute;krit
dialect,&mdash;&ldquo;Here forsooth is a cat,&rdquo; so managing to
preserve verbal truth.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4532src" href=
"#xd27e4532" name="xd27e4532src">15</a> Then Gautama said, laughing,
&ldquo;It is quite true that your lover is here,&mdash;and he inflicted
on her a curse, but ordained that it should terminate because she had
shewed some regard for truth.&rdquo; The curse ran as follows;
&ldquo;Woman of bad character, take for a long time the nature of a
stone, until thou behold R&aacute;ma wandering in the forest.&rdquo;
And Gautama at the same time inflicted on the god Indra the following
curse; &ldquo;A thousand pictures of that which thou hast desired shall
be upon thy body, but when thou shalt behold Tilottam&aacute;, a
heavenly nymph, whom Vi&#347;vakarman shall make, they shall turn into
a thousand eyes.&rdquo; When he had pronounced this curse, the hermit
returned to his austerities according to his desire, but Ahaly&aacute;
for her part assumed the awful condition of a stone. And Indra
immediately had his body covered with repulsive marks; for to whom is
not immorality a cause of humiliation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So true is it that every man&rsquo;s evil actions always bear
fruit in himself, for whatever seed a man sows, of that he reaps the
fruit. Therefore persons of noble character never desire that, which is
disagreeable to their neighbours, for this is the invariable observance
of the good, prescribed by divine law. And you two were sister
goddesses in a former birth, but you have been degraded in consequence
of a curse, and accordingly your hearts are free from strife and bent
on doing one another good turns.&rdquo; When they heard this from
Vasantaka, V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;
dismissed from their hearts even the smallest remnants of mutual
jealousy. But the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; made her husband
equally the property of both, and acted as kindly to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; as if she were herself, desiring her
welfare.</p>
<p>When the king of Magadha heard of that so great generosity of hers
from the messengers sent by Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, he was much
pleased. So on the next day the minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
came up to the king of Vatsa in the presence of the queen, the others
also standing by, and said, &ldquo;Why do we not go now to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, my prince, in order to begin our
enterprise, for we know that there is nothing to be feared from the
king of Magadha, even though he has been deceived? For he has been
completely gained over by means of the negotiation termed &lsquo;Giving
of a daughter&rsquo;: and how could he make war and so abandon his
daughter whom he loves more than life? He must keep his word; moreover
he has not been deceived by you; I did it all myself; and it does not
displease him; indeed I have learned from my spies that he will not act
in a hostile way, and it was for this very purpose that we remained
here for these days.&rdquo; While Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who had
accomplished the task he had in hand, was speaking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>thus, a messenger belonging to the king of
Magadha arrived there, and entered into the palace immediately, being
announced by the warder, and after he had done obeisance, he sat down
and said to the king of Vatsa; &ldquo;The king of Magadha is delighted
with the intelligence sent by the queen Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and he
now sends this message to your Highness&mdash;&lsquo;What need is there
of many words? I have heard all, and I am pleased with thee. Therefore
do the thing for the sake of which this beginning has been made; we
submit ourselves.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The king of Vatsa joyfully
received this clear speech of the messenger&rsquo;s, resembling the
blossom of the tree of policy planted by Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a.
Then he brought Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; with the queen, and, after he
had bestowed a present upon the messenger, he dismissed him with
honour. Then a messenger from Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena also
arrived, and, after entering, he bowed before the king, according to
custom, and said to him, &ldquo;O king, his majesty
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena, who understands the secrets of
policy, has learnt the state of thy affairs and delighted sends this
message&mdash;&lsquo;Your majesty&rsquo;s excellence is plainly
declared by this one fact, that you have Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
for your minister, what need of further speeches? Blessed too is
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who, through devotion to you, has done a
deed which makes us exalt our head for ever among the good, moreover
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; is not separated from V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
in my regard, for they two have one heart; therefore quickly exert
yourself.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king of Vatsa heard this speech of his
father-in-law&rsquo;s messenger, joy suddenly arose in his heart, and
his exceeding warmth of affection for the queen was increased, and also
the great respect which he felt for his excellent minister. Then the
king, together with the queens, entertained the messenger according to
the laws of due hospitality, in joyful excitement of mind, and sent him
away pleased; and as he was bent on commencing his enterprise, he
determined, after deliberating with his ministers, on returning to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;.</p>

<p class="first">So on the next day the king of Vatsa set out from
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka for Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, accompanied by
his wives and his ministers, and as he advanced, shouts broke forth
from his forces, that filled the plains like the waters of the ocean
overflowing out of due time. An image would be furnished of that king
advancing on his mighty elephant, if the sun were to journey in the
heaven accompanied by the eastern mountain. That king, shaded with his
white umbrella, shewed as if waited upon by the moon, delighted at
having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>outdone the splendour of the sun. While he
towered resplendent above them all, the chiefs circled around him, like
the planets<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4553src" href="#xd27e4553" name=
"xd27e4553src">1</a> in their orbits around the polar star. And those
queens, mounted on a female elephant that followed his, shone like the
earth-goddess and the goddess of Fortune accompanying him out of
affection in visible shape. The earth, that lay in his path, dinted
with the edges of the hoofs of the troops of his prancing steeds,
seemed to bear the prints of loving nails, as if it had been enjoyed by
the king. In this style progressing, the king of Vatsa, being
continually praised by his minstrels, reached in a few days the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, in which the people kept holiday. The city
was resplendent on that occasion, her lord<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4559src" href="#xd27e4559" name="xd27e4559src">2</a> having
returned from sojourning abroad. She was clothed in the red silk of
banners, round windows were her expanded eyes, the full pitchers in the
space in front of the gates were her two swelling breasts, the joyous
shouts of the crowd were her cheerful conversation, and white palaces
her smile.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4565src" href="#xd27e4565" name=
"xd27e4565src">3</a> So, accompanied by his two wives, the king entered
the city, and the ladies of the town were much delighted at beholding
him. The heaven was filled with hundreds of faces of fair ones standing
on charming palaces, as if with the soldiers of the moon<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4568src" href="#xd27e4568" name="xd27e4568src">4</a>
that was surpassed in beauty by the faces of the queens, having come to
pay their respects. And other women established at the windows, looking
with unwinking eyes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4572src" href=
"#xd27e4572" name="xd27e4572src">5</a> seemed like heavenly nymphs in
a&euml;rial chariots, that had come there out of curiosity. Other
women, with their long-lashed eyes closely applied to the lattice of
the windows, made, so to speak, cages of arrows to confine love. The
eager eye of one woman expanded with desire to behold the king, came,
so to speak, to the side of her ear,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4578src" href="#xd27e4578" name="xd27e4578src">6</a> that did not
perceive him, in order to inform it. The rapidly heaving breasts of
another, who had run up hastily, seemed to want to leap out of her
bodice with ardour to behold him. The necklace of another lady was
broken with her excitement, and the pearl-beads seemed like tear-drops
of joy falling from her heart. Some women, beholding
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and remembering the former report of her
having been burned, said as if with anxiety; &ldquo;If the fire were to
do her an injury at L&aacute;v&aacute;naka, then the sun might as well
diffuse over the world darkness which is alien to his nature.&rdquo;
Another lady beholding Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; said to her companion;
&ldquo;I am glad to see that the queen is not put to shame by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>her fellow-wife, who seems like her
friend.&rdquo; And others beholding those two queens, and throwing over
them garlands of eyes expanded with joy so as to resemble blue lotuses,
said to one another; &ldquo;Surely &#346;iva and Vish&#7751;u have not
beheld the beauty of these two, otherwise how could they regard with
much respect their consorts Um&aacute; and &#346;r&iacute;?&rdquo; In
this way feasting the eyes of the population, the king of Vatsa with
the queens entered his own palace, after performing auspicious
ceremonies. Such as is the splendour of a lotus-pool in windy weather,
or of the sea when the moon is rising, such was at that period the
wonderful splendour of the king&rsquo;s palace. And in a moment it was
filled with the presents, which the feudatories offered to procure good
luck, and which foreshadowed the coming in of offerings from
innumerable kings. And so the king of Vatsa, after honouring the
chiefs, entered with great festivity the inner apartments, at the same
time finding his way to the heart of every one present. And there he
remained between the two queens, like the god of Love between Rati and
Pr&iacute;ti,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4589src" href="#xd27e4589"
name="xd27e4589src">7</a> and spent the rest of the day in drinking and
other enjoyments.</p>
<p>The next day, when he was sitting in the hall of assembly
accompanied by his ministers, a certain Br&aacute;hman came and cried
out at the door; &ldquo;Protection for the Br&aacute;hmans! O king!
certain wicked herdsmen have cut off my son&rsquo;s foot in the forest
without any reason.&rdquo; When he heard that, the king immediately had
two or three herdsmen seized and brought before him, and proceeded to
question them. Then they gave the following answer; &ldquo;O king,
being herdsmen we roam in the wilderness, and there we have among us a
herdsman named Devasena, and he sits in a certain place in the forest
on a stone seat, and says to us &lsquo;I am your king&rsquo; and gives
us orders. And not a man among us disobeys his orders. Thus, O king,
that herdsman rules supreme in the wood. Now to-day the son of this
Br&aacute;hman came that way, and did not do obeisance to the herdsman
king, and when we by the order of the king said to
him&mdash;&lsquo;Depart not without doing thy
reverence&rsquo;&mdash;the young fellow pushed us aside, and went off
laughing in spite of the admonition. Then the herdsman king commanded
us to punish the contumacious boy by cutting off his foot. So we, O
king, ran after him, and cut off his foot; what man of our humble
degree is able to disobey the command of a ruler?&rdquo; When the
herdsmen had made this representation to the king, the wise
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, after thinking it over, said to him in
private; &ldquo;Certainly that place must contain treasure, on the
strength of which a mere herdsman has such influence.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4594src" href="#xd27e4594" name="xd27e4594src">8</a> So let us
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>go there.&rdquo; When his minister had said this
to him, the king made those herdsmen shew him the way, and went to that
place in the forest with his soldiers and his attendants.</p>
<p>And while, after the ground had been examined, peasants were digging
there, a Yaksha in stature like a mountain rose up from beneath it, and
said, &ldquo;O king, this treasure, which I have so long guarded,
belongs to thee, as having been buried by thy forefathers, therefore
take possession of it.&rdquo; After he had said this to the king and
accepted his worship, the Yaksha disappeared, and a great treasure was
displayed in the excavation. And from it was extracted a valuable
throne studded with jewels,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4603src" href=
"#xd27e4603" name="xd27e4603src">9</a> for in the time of prosperity a
long series of happy and fortunate events takes place. The Lord of
Vatsa took away the whole treasure from the spot in high glee, and
after chastising those herdsmen returned to his own city. There the
people saw that golden throne brought by the king, which seemed with
the streams of rays issuing from its blood-red jewels to
foretell<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4606src" href="#xd27e4606" name=
"xd27e4606src">10</a> the king&rsquo;s forceful conquest of all the
regions, and which with its pearls fixed on the end of projecting
silver spikes seemed to show its teeth as if laughing again and again
when it considered the astonishing intellect of the king&rsquo;s
ministers;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4612src" href="#xd27e4612" name=
"xd27e4612src">11</a> and they expressed their joy in a charming
manner, by striking drums of rejoicing so that they sent forth their
glad sounds. The ministers too rejoiced exceedingly, making certain of
the king&rsquo;s triumph; for prosperous events happening at the very
commencement of an enterprise portend its final success. Then the sky
was filled with flags resembling flashes of lightning, and the king
like a cloud rained gold on his dependants. And this day having been
spent in feasting, on the morrow Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, wishing
to know the mind of the king of Vatsa, said to him; &ldquo;O king,
ascend and adorn that great throne, which thou hast obtained by
inheritance from thy ancestors.&rdquo; But the king said, &ldquo;Surely
it is only after conquering all the regions that I can gain glory by
ascending that throne, which those famous ancestors of mine mounted
after conquering the earth. Not till I have subdued this widely-gemmed
earth bounded by the main, will I ascend the great jewelled throne of
my ancestors.&rdquo; Saying this, the king did not mount the throne as
yet. For men of high birth possess genuine loftiness of spirit.
Thereupon Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a being delighted said to him in
private; &ldquo;Bravo! my king! So make first an attempt to conquer the
eastern region.&rdquo; When he heard that, the king eagerly asked his
minister; &ldquo;When there are other cardinal points, why do kings
first march towards the East?&rdquo; When Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
heard this, he said to him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>again; &ldquo;The North, O king,
though rich, is defiled by intercourse with barbarians, and the West is
not honoured as being the cause of the setting of the sun and other
heavenly bodies; and the South is seen to be neighboured by
R&aacute;kshasas and inhabited by the god of death; but in the eastern
quarter the sun rises, over the East presides Indra, and towards the
East flows the Ganges, therefore the East is preferred. Moreover among
the countries situated between the Vindhya and Him&aacute;laya
mountains, the country laved by the waters of the Ganges is considered
most excellent. Therefore monarchs who desire success march first
towards the East, and dwell moreover in the land visited by the river
of the gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4622src" href="#xd27e4622"
name="xd27e4622src">12</a> For your ancestors also conquered the
regions by beginning with the East, and made their dwelling in
Hastin&aacute;pura on the banks of the Ganges; but
&#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka repaired to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; on
account of its delightful situation, seeing that empire depended upon
valour, and situation had nothing to do with it.&rdquo; When he had
said this Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a stopped speaking; and the king
out of his great regard for heroic exploits said; &ldquo;It is true
that dwelling in any prescribed country is not the cause of empire in
this world, for to men of brave disposition their own valour is the
only cause of success. For a brave man by himself without any support
obtains prosperity; have you never heard <i>&agrave; propos</i> of this
the tale of the brave man?&rdquo; Having said this, the lord of Vatsa
on the entreaty of his ministers again began to speak, and related in
the presence of the queens the following wonderful story.</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Vid&uacute;shaka.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Ujjayin&iacute;, which is celebrated
throughout the earth, there was in former days a king named
<span class="corr" id="xd27e4636" title=
"Source: &Acirc;dityasena">&Aacute;dityasena</span>. He was a
treasure-house of valour, and on account of his sole supremacy, his war
chariot, like that of the sun,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4639src"
href="#xd27e4639" name="xd27e4639src">13</a> was not impeded anywhere.
When his lofty umbrella, gleaming white like snow, illuminated the
firmament, other kings free from heat depressed theirs. He was the
receptacle of the jewels produced over the surface of the whole earth,
as the sea is the receptacle of waters. Once on a time, he was encamped
with his army on the banks of the Ganges, where he had come for some
reason or other. There a certain rich merchant of the country, named
Gunavartman, came to the king bringing a gem of maidens as a present,
and sent this message by the mouth of the warder. This maiden, though
the gem of the three worlds, has been born in my house, and I cannot
give her to any one else, only your Highness is fit to be the husband
of such a girl. Then Gunavartman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>entered and shewed his
daughter to the king. The king, when he beheld that maiden,
Tejasvat&iacute; by name, illuminating with her brightness the quarters
of the heavens, like the flame of the rays from the jewels in the
temple of the god of Love, was all enveloped with the radiance of her
beauty and fell in love with her, and, as if heated with the fire of
passion, began to dissolve in drops of sweat. So he at once accepted
her, who was fit for the rank of head queen, and being highly delighted
made Gunavartman equal to himself in honour. Then, having married his
dear Tejasvat&iacute;, the king thought all his objects in life
accomplished, and went with her to Ujjayin&iacute;. There the king
fixed his gaze so exclusively on her face, that he could not see the
affairs of his kingdom, though they were of great importance. And his
ear being, so to speak, riveted on her musical discourse could not be
attracted by the cries of his distressed subjects. The king entered
into his harem for a long time and never left it, but the fever of fear
left the hearts of his enemies. And after some time there was born to
the king, by the queen Tejasvat&iacute;, a girl welcomed by all, and
there arose in his heart the desire of conquest, which was equally
welcome to his subjects. That girl of exceeding beauty, who made the
three worlds seem worthless as stubble, excited in him joy, and desire
of conquest excited his valour. Then that king &Aacute;dityasena set
out one day from Ujjayin&iacute; to attack a certain contumacious
chieftain; and he made that queen Tejasvat&iacute; go with him mounted
on an elephant, as if she were the protecting goddess of the host. And
he mounted an admirable horse, that in spirit and fury resembled a
torrent,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4650src" href="#xd27e4650" name=
"xd27e4650src">14</a> tall like a moving mountain, with a curl on its
breast, and a girth. It seemed to imitate with its feet raised as high
as its mouth, the going of Garu&#7693;a which it had seen in the
heaven, rivalling its own swiftness, and it lifted up its head and
seemed with fearless eye to measure the earth, as if thinking,
&ldquo;what shall be the limit of my speed?&rdquo; And after the king
had gone a little way, he came to a level piece of ground, and put his
horse to its utmost speed to shew it off to Tejasvat&iacute;. That
horse, on being struck with his heel, went off rapidly, like an arrow
impelled from a catapult, in some unknown direction, so that it became
invisible to the eyes of men. The soldiers, when they saw that take
place, were bewildered, and horsemen galloped in a thousand directions
after the king, who was run away with by his horse, but could not
overtake him. Thereupon the ministers with the soldiers, fearing some
calamity, in their anxiety took with them the weeping queen and
returned to Ujjayin&iacute;; there they remained with gates closed and
ramparts guarded, seeking for news of the king, having cheered up the
citizens.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king was carried by the horse in an instant to
the impassable forest of the Vindhya hills, haunted by terrible lions.
Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>the horse happened to stand still, and the king
was immediately distracted with bewilderment, as the great forest made
it impossible for him to know whereabouts he was. Seeing no other way
out of his difficulties, the king, who knew what the horse had been in
a former birth, got down from his saddle, and prostrating himself
before the excellent horse, said to him<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4657src" href="#xd27e4657" name="xd27e4657src">15</a>:
&ldquo;Thou art a god; a creature like thee should not commit treason
against his lord; so I look upon thee as my protector, take me by a
pleasant path.&rdquo; When the horse heard that, he was full of regret,
remembering his former birth; and mentally acceded to the king&rsquo;s
request, for excellent horses are divine beings. Then the king mounted
again, and the horse set out by a road bordered with clear cool lakes,
that took away the fatigue of the journey; and by evening the splendid
horse had taken the king another hundred <i>yojanas</i> and brought him
near Ujjayin&iacute;. As the sun beholding his horses, though seven in
number, excelled by this courser&rsquo;s speed, had sunk, as it were
through shame, into the ravines of the western mountain, and as the
darkness was diffused abroad, the wise horse seeing that the gates of
Ujjayin&iacute; were closed, and that the burning-place outside the
gates was terrible at that time, carried the king for shelter to a
concealed monastery of Br&aacute;hmans, that was situated in a lonely
place outside the walls. And the king &Aacute;dityasena seeing that
that monastery was a fit place to spend the night in, as his horse was
tired, attempted to enter it. But the Br&aacute;hmans, who dwelt there,
opposed his entrance, saying that he must be some keeper of a
cemetery<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4677src" href="#xd27e4677" name=
"xd27e4677src">16</a> or some thief. And out they poured in quarrelsome
mood, with savage gestures, for Br&aacute;hmans who live by chanting
the S&aacute;ma Veda, are the home of timidity, boorishness, and
ill-temper. While they were clamouring, a virtuous Br&aacute;hman named
Vid&uacute;shaka, the bravest of the brave, came out from that
monastery. He was a young man distinguished for strength of arm, who
had propitiated the fire by his austerities, and obtained a splendid
sword from that divinity, which he had only to think of, and it came to
him. That resolute youth Vid&uacute;shaka seeing that king of
distinguished bearing, who had arrived by night, thought to himself
that he was some god in disguise. And the well-disposed youth pushed
away all those other Br&aacute;hmans, and bowing humbly before the
king, caused him to enter the monastery. And when he had rested, and
had the dust of the journey washed off by female slaves,
Vid&uacute;shaka prepared for him suitable food. And he took the saddle
off that excellent horse of his, and relieved its fatigue by giving it
grass and other fodder. And after he had made a bed for the wearied
king, he said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;My lord, I will guard your person,
so sleep in peace&rdquo;&mdash;and while the king slept, that
Br&aacute;hman kept watch the whole night at the door with the sword of
the Fire-god in his hand, that came to him on his thinking of it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>And on the morrow early, Vid&uacute;shaka, without receiving any
orders, of his own accord saddled the horse for the king, as soon as he
awoke. The king for his part took leave of him, and mounting his horse
entered the city of Ujjayin&iacute;, beheld afar off by the people
bewildered with joy. And the moment he entered, his subjects approached
him with a confused hum of delight at his return. The king accompanied
by his ministers entered the palace, and great anxiety left the breast
of the queen Tejasvat&iacute;. Immediately grief seemed to be swept
away from the city by the rows of silken flags displayed out of joy,
which waved in the wind; and the queen made high festival until the end
of the day, until such time as the people of the city and the sun were
red as vermilion.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4683src" href="#xd27e4683"
name="xd27e4683src">17</a> And the next day the king &Aacute;dityasena
had Vid&uacute;shaka summoned from the monastery with all the other
Br&aacute;hmans. And as soon as he had made known what took place in
the night, he gave his benefactor Vid&uacute;shaka a thousand villages.
And the grateful king also gave that Br&aacute;hman an umbrella and an
elephant and appointed him his domestic chaplain, so that he was beheld
with great interest by the people. So Vid&uacute;shaka then became
equal to a chieftain, for how can a benefit conferred on great persons
fail of bearing fruit? And the noble-minded Vid&uacute;shaka shared all
those villages, which he had received from the king, with the
Br&aacute;hmans who lived in the monastery. And he remained in the
court of the king in attendance upon him, enjoying together with the
other Br&aacute;hmans the income of those villages. But as time went
on, those other Br&aacute;hmans began striving each of them to be
chief, and made no account of Vid&uacute;shaka, being intoxicated with
the pride of wealth. Dwelling in separate parties, seven in one place,
with their mutual rivalries they oppressed the villages like malignant
planets. Vid&uacute;shaka regarded their excesses with scornful
indifference, for men of firm mind rightly treat with contempt men of
little soul. Once upon a time a Br&aacute;hman of the name of
Chakradhara, who was naturally stern, seeing them engaged in wrangling,
came up to them. Chakradhara, though he was one-eyed, was keen-sighted
enough in deciding what was right in other men&rsquo;s affairs, and
though a hunchback, was straightforward enough in speech. He said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;While you were living by begging, you obtained this
windfall, you rascals, then why do you ruin the villages with your
mutual intolerance? It is all the fault of Vid&uacute;shaka who has
permitted you to act thus; so you may be certain that in a short time
you will again have to roam about begging. For a situation, in which
there is no head, and every one has to shift for himself by his own
wits as chance directs, is better than one of disunion under many
heads, in which all affairs go to rack and ruin. So take my advice and
appoint one firm man as your head, if you desire unshaken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>prosperity, which can only be ensured by a
capable governor.&rdquo; On hearing that, every one of them desired the
headship for himself; thereupon Chakradhara after reflection again said
to those fools; &ldquo;As you are so addicted to mutual rivalry I
propose to you a basis of agreement. In the neighbouring cemetery three
robbers have been executed by impalement; whoever is daring enough to
cut off the noses of those three by night and to bring them here, he
shall be your head, for courage merits command.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4688src" href="#xd27e4688" name="xd27e4688src">18</a>&rdquo; When
Chakradhara made this proposal to the Br&aacute;hmans,
Vid&uacute;shaka, who was standing near, said to them; &ldquo;Do this,
what is there to be afraid of?&rdquo; Then the Br&aacute;hmans said to
him; &ldquo;We are not bold enough to do it, let whoever is able, do
it, and we will abide by the agreement.&rdquo; Then Vid&uacute;shaka
said, &ldquo;Well, I will do it, I will cut off the noses of those
robbers by night and bring them from the cemetery.&rdquo; Then those
fools, thinking the task a difficult one, said to him; &ldquo;If you do
this you shall be our lord, we make this agreement.&rdquo; When they
had pronounced this agreement, and night had set in, Vid&uacute;shaka
took leave of those Br&aacute;hmans and went to the cemetery. So the
hero entered the cemetery awful as his own undertaking, with the sword
of the Fire-god, that came with a thought, as his only companion. And
in the middle of that cemetery where the cries of vultures and jackals
were swelled by the screams of witches, and the flames of the funeral
pyres were reinforced by the fires in the mouths of the fire-breathing
demons, he beheld those impaled men with their faces turned up, as if
through fear of having their noses cut off. And when he approached
them, those three being tenanted by demons struck him with their
fists<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4721src" href="#xd27e4721" name=
"xd27e4721src">19</a>; and he for his part slashed them in return with
his sword, for fear has not learned to bestir herself in the breast of
the resolute. Accordingly the corpses ceased to be convulsed with
demons, and then the successful hero cut off their noses and brought
them away, binding them up in his garment. And as he was returning, he
beheld in that cemetery a religious mendicant sitting on a corpse
muttering charms, and through curiosity to have the amusement of seeing
what he was doing, he stood concealed behind that mendicant. In a
moment the corpse under the mendicant gave forth a hissing sound, and
flames issued from its mouth, and from its navel mustard-seeds. And
then the mendicant took the mustard-seeds, and rising up struck the
corpse with the flat of his hand, and the corpse, which was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>tenanted by a mighty demon, stood up, and then
that mendicant mounted on its shoulder, and began to depart at a rapid
rate,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4727src" href="#xd27e4727" name=
"xd27e4727src">20</a> and Vid&uacute;shaka silently followed him
unobserved, and after he had gone a short distance Vid&uacute;shaka saw
an empty temple with an image of Durg&aacute; in it. Then the mendicant
got down from the shoulder of the demon, and entered the inner shrine
of the temple, while the demon fell flat on the earth. But
Vid&uacute;shaka was present also, contriving to watch the mendicant,
unperceived by him. The mendicant worshipped the goddess there and
offered the following prayer; &ldquo;If thou art pleased with me, O
goddess, grant me the desired boon. If not I will propitiate thee with
the sacrifice of myself.&rdquo; When the mendicant, intoxicated with
the success of his powerful spells, said this, a voice coming from the
inner shrine thus addressed the mendicant; &ldquo;Bring here the maiden
daughter of king &Aacute;dityasena, and offer her as a sacrifice, then
thou shalt obtain thy desire.&rdquo; When the mendicant heard this, he
went out, and striking once more with his hand the demon,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4733src" href="#xd27e4733" name=
"xd27e4733src">21</a> who hissed at the blow, made him stand upright.
And mounting on the shoulder of the demon, from whose mouth issued
flames of fire, he flew away through the air to bring the princess.
Vid&uacute;shaka seeing all this from his place of concealment thought
to himself; &ldquo;What! shall he slay the king&rsquo;s daughter while
I am alive? I will remain here until the scoundrel returns.&rdquo;
Having formed this resolve, Vid&uacute;shaka remained there in
concealment. But the mendicant entered the female apartments of the
palace through the window, and found the king&rsquo;s daughter asleep,
as it was night. And he returned, all clothed in darkness, through the
air, bringing with him the princess who illuminated with her beauty the
region, as R&aacute;hu carries off a digit of the moon. And bearing
along with him that princess who exclaimed in her
grief&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! my father! Alas! my mother&rdquo;&mdash;he
descended from the sky in that very temple of the goddess. And then,
dismissing the demon, he entered with that pearl of maidens into the
inner shrine of the goddess, and while he was preparing to slay the
princess there, Vid&uacute;shaka came in with his sword drawn. He said
to the mendicant, &ldquo;Villain! do you wish to smite a jasmine flower
with a thunder-bolt, in that you desire to employ a weapon against this
tender form?&rdquo; And then he seized the trembling mendicant by the
hair, and cut off his head. And he consoled the princess distracted
with fear, who clung to him closely as she began to recognise him. And
then the hero thought; &ldquo;How can I manage during the night to
convey this princess from this place to the harem?&rdquo; Then a voice
from the air addressed him; &ldquo;Hear this O Vid&uacute;shaka! the
mendicant, whom thou hast slain, had in his power a great demon and
some grains of mustard-seed. Thence arose his desire to be ruler of the
earth and marry the daughters of kings, and so the fool has this day
been baffled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>Therefore thou hero, take those mustard-seeds,
in order that for this night only thou mayest be enabled to travel
through the air.&rdquo; Thus the a&euml;rial voice addressed the
delighted Vid&uacute;shaka; for even the gods often take such a hero
under their protection. Then he took in his hand those grains of
mustard-seed from the corner of the mendicant&rsquo;s robe, and the
princess in his arms. And while he was setting out from that temple of
the goddess, another voice sounded in the air; &ldquo;Thou must return
to this very temple of the goddess at the end of a month, thou must not
forget this, O hero!&rdquo; When he heard this, Vid&uacute;shaka said
&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo;&mdash;and by the favour of the goddess he
immediately flew up into the air bearing with him the princess. And
flying through the air he quickly placed that princess in her private
apartments, and said to her after she had recovered her spirits;
&ldquo;To-morrow morning I shall not be able to fly through the air,
and so all men will see me going out, so I must depart now.&rdquo; When
he said this to her, the maiden being alarmed, answered him;
&ldquo;When you are gone, this breath of mine will leave my body
overcome with fear. Therefore do not depart, great-souled hero; once
more save my life, for the good make it their business from their birth
to carry out every task they have undertaken.&rdquo; When the brave
Vid&uacute;shaka heard that, he reflected, &ldquo;If I go, and leave
this maiden, she may possibly die of fear; and then what kind of
loyalty to my sovereign shall I have exhibited? Thinking thus he
remained all night in those female apartments, and he gradually dropped
off to sleep wearied with toil and watching. But the princess in her
terror passed that night without sleeping: and even when the morning
came she did not wake up the sleeping Vid&uacute;shaka, as her mind was
made tender by love<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4740src" href=
"#xd27e4740" name="xd27e4740src">22</a>, and she said to herself;
&ldquo;Let him rest a little longer.&rdquo; Then the servants of the
harem came in and saw him, and in a state of consternation they went
and told the king. The king for his part sent the warder to discover
the truth, and he entering beheld Vid&uacute;shaka there. And he heard
the whole story from the mouth of the princess, and went and repeated
it all to the king. And the king knowing the excellent character of
Vid&uacute;shaka, was immediately bewildered, wondering what it could
mean. And he had Vid&uacute;shaka brought from his daughter&rsquo;s
apartment, escorted all the way by her soul, which followed him out of
affection. And when he arrived, the king asked him what had taken
place, and Vid&uacute;shaka told him the whole story from the
beginning, and shewed him the noses of the robbers fastened up in the
end of his garment, and the mustard-seeds which had been in the
possession of the mendicant, different from those found on earth. The
high-minded monarch suspected that Vid&uacute;shaka&rsquo;s story was
true from these circumstances, so he had all the Br&aacute;hmans of the
monastery brought before him, together with Chakradhara, and asked
about the original cause of the whole matter. And he went in person to
the cemetery and saw those men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>with their noses cut off, and
that base mendicant with his neck severed, and then he reposed complete
confidence in, and was much pleased with, the skilful and successful
Vid&uacute;shaka, who had saved his daughter&rsquo;s life. And he gave
him his own daughter on the spot; what do generous men withhold when
pleased with their benefactors? Surely the goddess of
Prosperity,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4748src" href="#xd27e4748" name=
"xd27e4748src">23</a> out of love for the lotus, dwelt in the hand of
the princess, since Vid&uacute;shaka obtained great good fortune after
he had received it in the marriage ceremony. Then Vid&uacute;shaka
enjoying a distinguished reputation, and engaged in attending upon the
sovereign, lived with that beloved wife in the palace of king
&Aacute;dityasena. Then as days went on, once upon a time the princess
impelled by some supernatural power said at night to Vid&uacute;shaka;
&ldquo;My lord, you remember that when you were in the temple of the
goddess a divine voice said to you, &lsquo;Come here at the end of a
month.&rsquo; To-day is the last day of the month, and you have
forgotten it.&rdquo; When his beloved said this to him,
Vid&uacute;shaka was delighted, and recalled it to mind, and said to
his wife&mdash;&ldquo;Well remembered on thy part, fair one! But I had
forgotten it.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span>
And then he embraced her by way of reward.<a id="xd27e4755" name=
"xd27e4755"></a> And then, while she was asleep, he left the
women&rsquo;s apartments by night, and in high spirits he went armed
with his sword to the temple of the goddess; then he exclaimed outside,
&ldquo;I Vid&uacute;shaka am arrived:&rdquo; and he heard this speech
uttered by some one inside&mdash;&ldquo;Come in,
Vid&uacute;shaka.&rdquo; Thereupon he entered and beheld a heavenly
palace, and inside it a lady of heavenly beauty with a heavenly
retinue, dispelling with her brightness the darkness, like a night set
on fire, looking as if she were the medicine to restore to life the god
of love consumed with the fire of the wrath of &#346;iva. He wondering
what it could all mean, was joyfully received by her in person with a
welcome full of affection and great respect. And when he had sat down
and had gained confidence from seeing her affection, he became eager to
understand the real nature of the adventure, and she said to him;
&ldquo;I am a maiden of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race, of high descent,
and my name is Bhadr&aacute;, and as I was roaming about at my will I
saw you here on that occasion. And as my mind was attracted by your
virtues, I uttered at that time that voice which seemed to come from
some one invisible, in order that you might return. And to-day I
bewildered the princess by employing my magic skill, so that under my
impulse she revived your remembrance of this matter, and for your sake
I am here, and so, handsome hero, I surrender myself to you; marry
me.&rdquo; The noble Vid&uacute;shaka, when the
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; Bhadr&aacute; addressed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>him
in this style, agreed that moment, and married her by the
G&aacute;ndharva ceremony. Then he remained in that very place, having
obtained celestial joys, the fruits of his own valour, living with that
beloved wife.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the princess woke up when the night came to an end, and
not seeing her husband, was immediately plunged in despair. So she got
up and went with tottering steps to her mother, all trembling, with her
eyes flooded with gushing tears. And she told her mother that her
husband had gone away somewhere in the night, and was full of
self-reproach, fearing that she had been guilty of some fault. Then her
mother was distracted owing to her love for her daughter, and so in
course of time the king heard of it, and came there, and fell into a
state of the utmost anxiety. When his daughter said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;I know my husband has gone to the temple of the
goddess outside the cemetery&rdquo;&mdash;the king went there in
person. But he was not able to find Vid&uacute;shaka there in spite of
all his searching, for he was concealed by virtue of the magic science
of the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;. Then the king returned, and his
daughter in despair determined to leave the body, but while she was
thus minded, some wise man came to her and said this to her; &ldquo;Do
not fear any misfortune, for that husband of thine is living in the
enjoyment of heavenly felicity, and will return to thee shortly.&rdquo;
When she heard that, the princess retained her life, which was kept in
her by the hope of her husband&rsquo;s return, that had taken deep root
in her heart.</p>
<p>Then, while Vid&uacute;shaka was living there, a certain friend of
his beloved, named Yoge&#347;var&iacute;, came to Bhadr&aacute;, and
said to her in secret&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, the Vidy&aacute;dharas
are angry with you because you live with a man, and they seek to do you
an injury, therefore leave this place. There is a city called
K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka on the shore of the eastern sea, and beyond that
there is a sanctifying stream named &#346;&iacute;tod&aacute;, and
after you cross that, there is a great mountain named Udaya,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4763src" href="#xd27e4763" name=
"xd27e4763src">24</a> the land of the Siddhas,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4768src" href="#xd27e4768" name="xd27e4768src">25</a> which the
Vidy&aacute;dharas may not invade; go there immediately, and do not be
anxious about the beloved mortal whom you leave here, for before you
start you can tell all this to him, so that he shall be able afterwards
to journey there with speed.&rdquo; When her friend said this to her,
Bhadr&aacute; was overcome with fear, and though attached to
Vid&uacute;shaka, she consented to do as her friend advised. So she
told her scheme to Vid&uacute;shaka, and providently gave him her ring,
and then disappeared at the close of the night. And Vid&uacute;shaka
immediately found himself in the empty temple of the goddess, in which
he had been before, and no Bhadr&aacute; and no palace. Remembering the
delusion produced by Bhadr&aacute;&rsquo;s magic skill, and beholding
the ring, Vid&uacute;shaka was overpowered by a paroxysm of despair and
wonder. And remembering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>her speech as if it were a dream,
he reflected,&mdash;&ldquo;Before she left, she assigned as a place of
meeting the mountain of the sun-rising; so I must quickly go there to
find her: but if I am seen by the people in this state, the king will
not let me go: so I will employ a stratagem in this matter, in order
that I may accomplish my object.&rdquo; So reflecting, the wise man
assumed another appearance, and went out from that temple with tattered
clothes, begrimed with dust, exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah Bhadr&aacute;! Ah
Bhadr&aacute;!&rdquo; And immediately the people, who lived in that
place, beholding him, raised a shout; &ldquo;Here is Vid&uacute;shaka
found!&rdquo; And the king hearing of it came out from his palace in
person, and seeing Vid&uacute;shaka in such a state, conducting himself
like a madman, he laid hold on him and took him back to his palace.
When he was there, whatever his servants and connexions, who were full
of affection, said to him, he answered only by exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah
Bhadr&aacute;! Ah Bhadr&aacute;!&rdquo; And when he was anointed with
unguents prescribed by the physicians, he immediately defiled his body
with much cinder-dust; and the food which the princess out of love
offered to him with her own hands, he instantly threw down and trampled
under foot. And in this condition Vid&uacute;shaka remained there some
days, without taking interest in anything, tearing his own clothes, and
playing the madman. And &Aacute;dityasena thought to himself;
&ldquo;His condition is past cure, so what is the use of torturing him?
He may perhaps die, and then I should be guilty of the death of a
Br&aacute;hman, whereas if he roams about at his will, he may possibly
recover in course of time.&rdquo; So he let him go. Then the hero
Vid&uacute;shaka, being allowed to roam where he liked, set out the
next day at his leisure to find Bhadr&aacute;, taking with him the
ring. And as he journeyed on day by day towards the East, he at last
reached a city named Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4775src" href="#xd27e4775" name="xd27e4775src">26</a>, which lay
in his way as he travelled on; there he entered the house of a certain
aged Br&aacute;hman woman, saying to her&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, I wish to
stop here one night.&rdquo; And she gave him a lodging and entertained
him, and shortly after, she approached him, full of inward sorrow, and
said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My son, I hereby give thee all this house,
therefore receive it, since I cannot now live any longer.&rdquo; He,
astonished, said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you speak thus?&rdquo; Then
she said&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, I will tell you the whole story,&rdquo;
and so continued as follows&mdash;&ldquo;My son, in this city there is
a king named Devasena, and to him there was born one daughter, the
ornament of the earth. The affectionate king said&mdash;&lsquo;I have
with difficulty obtained this one daughter&rsquo;,&mdash;so he gave her
the name of Duh&#803;kalabdhik&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4778src" href="#xd27e4778" name="xd27e4778src">27</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In course of time when she had grown up, the king gave her in
marriage to the king of Kachchhapa, whom he had brought to his own
palace. The king of Kachchhapa entered at night the private apartments
of his bride, and died the very first time he entered them. Then the
king much distressed, again gave his daughter in marriage to another
king; he also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>perished in the same way<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4785src" href="#xd27e4785" name="xd27e4785src">28</a>: and when
through fear of the same fate other kings did not wish to marry her,
the king gave this order to his general&mdash;&lsquo;You must bring a
man in turn from every single house in this country, so that one shall
be supplied every day, and he must be a Br&aacute;hman or a Kshatriya.
And after you have brought the man, you must cause him to enter by
night into the apartment of my daughter; let us see how many will
perish in this way, and how long it will go on. Whoever escapes shall
afterwards become her husband; for it is impossible to bar the course
of fate, whose dispensations are mysterious.&rsquo; The general, having
received this order from the king, brings a man every day turn about
from every house in this city, and in this way hundreds of men have met
their death in the apartment of the princess. Now I, whose merits in a
former life must have been deficient, have one son here; his turn has
to-day arrived to go to the palace to meet his death; and I being
deprived of him must to-morrow enter the fire. Therefore, while I am
still alive, I give to you, a worthy object, all my house with my own
hand, in order that my lot may not again be unfortunate in my next
birth.&rdquo; When she had said this, the resolute Vid&uacute;shaka
answered; &ldquo;If this is the whole matter, do not be despondent,
mother, I will go there to-day, let your only son live. And do not feel
any commiseration with regard to me, so as to say to
yourself&mdash;&lsquo;Why should I be the cause of this man&rsquo;s
death?&rsquo;&mdash;for owing to the magical power which I possess I
run no risk by going there.&rdquo; When Vid&uacute;shaka had said this,
that Br&aacute;hman woman said to him, &ldquo;Then you must be some god
come here as a reward for my virtue, so cause me, my son, to recover
life, and yourself to gain felicity.&rdquo; When she had expressed her
approval of his project in these words, he went in the evening to the
apartment of the princess, together with a servant appointed by the
general to conduct him. There he beheld the princess flushed with the
pride of youth, like a creeper weighed down with the burden of its
abundant flowers that had not yet been gathered. Accordingly, when
night came, the princess went to her bed, and Vid&uacute;shaka remained
awake in her apartment, holding in his hand the sword of the Fire-god,
which came to him with a thought, saying to himself, &ldquo;I will find
out who it is that slays men here.&rdquo; And when people were all
asleep, he saw a terrible R&aacute;kshasa coming from the side of the
apartment where the entrance was, having first opened the door; and the
R&aacute;kshasa standing at the entrance stretched forward into the
room an arm, which had been the swift wand of Death to hundreds of men.
But Vid&uacute;shaka in wrath springing forward, cut off suddenly the
arm of the R&aacute;kshasa with one stroke of his sword.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4790src" href="#xd27e4790" name=
"xd27e4790src">29</a> And the R&aacute;kshasa immediately fled away
through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>fear of his exceeding valour, with the loss of
one arm, never again to return. When the princess awoke, she saw the
severed arm lying there, and she was terrified, delighted and
astonished at the same time. And in the morning the king Devasena saw
the arm of the R&aacute;kshasa, which had fallen down after it was cut
off, lying at the door of his daughter&rsquo;s apartments; in this way
Vid&uacute;shaka, as if to say &ldquo;Henceforth no other men must
enter here&rdquo;&mdash;fastened the door as it were with a long
bar.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4795src" href="#xd27e4795" name=
"xd27e4795src">30</a> Accordingly the delighted king gave to
Vid&uacute;shaka, who possessed this divine power, his daughter and
much wealth; and Vid&uacute;shaka dwelt there some days with this fair
one, as if with prosperity incarnate in bodily form. But one day he
left the princess while asleep, and set out at night in haste to find
his Bhadr&aacute;. And the princess in the morning was afflicted at not
seeing him, but she was comforted by her father with the hope of his
return. Vid&uacute;shaka journeying on day by day, at last reached the
city of T&aacute;mralipt&aacute; not far from the eastern sea. There he
joined himself to a certain merchant, named Skandhad&aacute;sa who
desired to cross the sea. In his company, embarking on a ship laden
with much wealth belonging to the merchant, he set out on the ocean
path. Then that ship was stopped suddenly when it had reached the
middle of the ocean, as if it were held by something. And when it did
not move, though the sea was propitiated with jewels, that merchant
Skandhad&aacute;sa being grieved, said this: &ldquo;Whosoever releases
this ship of mine which is detained, to him I will give half of my own
wealth and my daughter.&rdquo; The resolute-souled Vid&uacute;shaka,
when he heard that, said, &ldquo;I will descend into the water of the
sea and search it, and I will set free in a moment this ship of yours
which is stopped: but you must support me by ropes fastened round my
body. And the moment the ship is set free, you must draw me up out of
the midst of the sea by the supporting ropes.&rdquo; The merchant
welcomed his speech with a promise to do what he asked, and the
steersmen bound ropes under his armpits. Supported in that way
Vid&uacute;shaka descended in the sea; a brave man never desponds when
the moment for action has arrived. So taking in his hand the sword of
the Fire-god, that came to him with a thought, the hero descended into
the midst of the sea under the ship. And there he saw a giant asleep,
and he saw that the ship was stopped by his leg. So he immediately cut
off his leg with his sword, and at once the ship moved on freed from
its impediment.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4805src" href="#xd27e4805"
name="xd27e4805src">31</a> When the wicked merchant saw that, he cut
the ropes, by which Vid&uacute;shaka was supported, through desire to
save the wealth he had promised him; and went swiftly to the other
shore of the ocean vast as his own avarice, in the ship which had thus
been set free. Vid&uacute;shaka for his part, being in the midst of the
sea with the supporting ropes cut, rose to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>surface, and seeing how matters stood he calmly
reflected for a moment; <span class="corr" id="xd27e4810" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Why did the merchant do this? Surely in
this case the proverb is applicable; &lsquo;Ungrateful men blinded by
desire of gain cannot see a benefit.&rsquo; Well, it is now high time
for me to display intrepidity, for if courage fails, even a small
calamity cannot be overcome.&rdquo; Thus he reflected on that occasion,
and then he got astride on the leg which he had cut off from the giant
sleeping in the water, and by its help he crossed the sea, as if with a
boat, paddling with his hands, for even destiny takes the part of men
of distinguished valour. Then a voice from heaven addressed that mighty
hero, who had come across the ocean, as Hanum&aacute;n did for the sake
of R&aacute;ma<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4813src" href="#xd27e4813"
name="xd27e4813src">32</a>; &ldquo;Bravo, Vid&uacute;shaka! Bravo! who
except thee is a man of valour? I am pleased with this courage of
thine: therefore hear this. Thou hast reached a desolate coast here,
but from this thou shalt arrive in seven days at the city of
K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka; then thou shalt pluck up fresh spirits, and
journeying quickly from that place, thou shalt obtain thy desire. But I
am the Fire, the consumer of the oblations to gods and the spirits of
deceased ancestors, whom thou didst before propitiate: and owing to my
favour thou shalt feel neither hunger nor thirst,&mdash;therefore go
prosperously and confidently;&rdquo; having thus spoken, the voice
ceased. And Vid&uacute;shaka, when he heard that, bowed, adoring the
Fire-god, and set forth in high spirits, and on the seventh day he
reached the city of K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka. And there he entered a
monastery, inhabited by many noble Br&aacute;hmans from various lands,
who were noted for hospitality. It was a wealthy foundation of the king
of that place &Aacute;ryavarman, and had annexed to it beautiful
temples all made of gold. There all of the Br&aacute;hmans welcomed
him, and one Br&aacute;hman took the guest to his chamber, and provided
him with a bath, with food and with clothing. And while he was living
in the monastery, he heard this proclamation being made by beat of drum
in the evening; &ldquo;Whatever Br&aacute;hman or Kshatriya wishes
to-morrow morning to marry the king&rsquo;s daughter, let him spend a
night in her chamber.&rdquo; When he heard that, he suspected the real
reason, and being always fond of daring adventures, he desired
immediately to go to the apartment of the princess. Thereupon the
Br&aacute;hmans of the monastery said to
him,&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, do not be guilty of rashness. The
apartment of the princess is not rightly so called, rather is it the
open mouth of death,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4819src" href=
"#xd27e4819" name="xd27e4819src">33</a> for whoever enters it at night
does not escape alive, and many daring men have thus met their death
there.&rdquo; In spite of what these Br&aacute;hmans told him,
Vid&uacute;shaka would not take their advice,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4825src" href="#xd27e4825" name="xd27e4825src">34</a> but went to
the palace of the king with his servants. There the king
&Aacute;ryavarman, when he saw him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>welcomed him in
person, and at night he entered the apartment of the king&rsquo;s
daughter, looking like the sun entering the fire. And he beheld that
princess who seemed by her appearance to be attached to him, for she
looked at him with tearful eye, and a sad look expressive of the grief
produced by utter despair. And he remained awake there all night gazing
intently, holding in his hand the sword of the Fire-god that came to
him with a thought. And suddenly he beheld at the entrance a very
terrible R&aacute;kshasa, extending his left hand because his right had
been cut off. And when he saw him, he said to himself; &ldquo;Here is
that very R&aacute;kshasa, whose arm I cut off in the city of
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana. So I will not strike at his arm again,
lest he should escape me and depart as before, and for this reason it
is better for me to kill him.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, Vid&uacute;shaka
ran forward and seized his hair, and was preparing to cut off his head,
when suddenly the R&aacute;kshasa in extreme terror said to him;
&ldquo;Do not slay me, you are brave, therefore shew mercy.&rdquo;
Vid&uacute;shaka let him go and said, &ldquo;Who are you, and what are
you about here?&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;kshasa, being thus questioned
by the hero, continued&mdash;&ldquo;My name is Yamadansh&#7789;ra, and
I had two daughters, this is one, and she who lives in
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana is another. And &#346;iva favoured me by
laying on me this command; &lsquo;Thou must save the two princesses
from marrying any one who is not a hero.&rsquo; While thus engaged I
first had an arm cut off at Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana, and now I have
been conquered by you here, so this duty of mine is
accomplished.&rdquo; When Vid&uacute;shaka heard this, he laughed, and
said to him in reply; &ldquo;It was I that cut off your arm there in
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana.&rdquo; The R&aacute;kshasa answered
&ldquo;Then you must be a portion of some divinity, not a mere man, I
think it was for your sake that &#346;iva did me the honour of laying
that command upon me. So henceforth I consider you my friend, and when
you call me to mind I will appear to you to ensure your success even in
difficulties.&rdquo; In these words the R&aacute;kshasa
Yamadansh&#7789;ra out of friendship chose him as a sworn brother, and
when Vid&uacute;shaka accepted his proposal, disappeared.
Vid&uacute;shaka, for his part, was commended for his valour by the
princess, and spent the night there in high spirits; and in the morning
the king hearing of the incident and highly pleased, gave him his
daughter as the conspicuous banner of his valour together with much
wealth. Vid&uacute;shaka lived there some nights with her, as if with
the goddess of prosperity, bound so firmly by his virtue<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4831src" href="#xd27e4831" name=
"xd27e4831src">35</a> that she could not move a step. But one night he
went off of his own accord from that place, longing for his beloved
Bhadr&aacute;, for who that has tasted heavenly joys, can take pleasure
in any other? And after he had left the town, he called to mind that
R&aacute;kshasa, and said to him, who appeared the moment he called him
to mind, and made him a bow,&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, I must go to the
land of the Siddhas on the Eastern mountain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>for
the sake of the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; named Bhadr&aacute;, so do you
take me there.&rdquo; The R&aacute;kshasa said&mdash;&ldquo;Very
good&rdquo;&mdash;so he ascended his shoulder, and travelled in that
night over sixty <i>yojanas</i> of difficult country; and in the
morning he crossed the &#346;&iacute;tod&aacute;<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e4842" title="Not in source">,</span> a river that cannot be
crossed by mortals, and without effort reached the border of the land
of the Siddhas.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4845src" href="#xd27e4845"
name="xd27e4845src">36</a> The R&aacute;kshasa said to him; &ldquo;Here
is the blessed mountain, called the mountain of the rising sun, in
front of you, but I cannot set foot upon it as it is the home of the
Siddhas.&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;kshasa being dismissed by him
departed, and there Vid&uacute;shaka beheld a delightful lake, and he
sat down on the bank of that lake beautiful with the faces of
full-blown lotuses, which, as it were, uttered a welcome to him with
the hum of roaming bees. And there he saw unmistakeable footsteps as of
women, seeming to say to him, this is the path to the house of your
beloved. While he was thinking to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Mortals cannot
set foot on this mountain, therefore I had better stop here a moment,
and see whose footsteps these are&rdquo;&mdash;there came to the lake
to draw water many beautiful women with golden pitchers in their hands.
So he asked the women, after they had filled their pitchers with water,
in a courteous manner; &ldquo;For whom are you taking this
water?&rdquo; And those women said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Excellent Sir, a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; of the name of Bhadr&aacute; is dwelling on
this mountain, this water is for her to bathe in.&rdquo; Wonderful to
say! Providence seeming to be pleased with resolute men, who attempt
mighty enterprises, makes all things subserve their ends. For one of
these women suddenly said to Vid&uacute;shaka; &ldquo;Noble sir, please
lift this pitcher on to my shoulder.&rdquo; He consented and when he
lifted the pitcher on to her shoulder, the discreet man put into it the
jewelled ring he had before received from Bhadr&aacute;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4854src" href="#xd27e4854" name=
"xd27e4854src">37</a> and then he sat down again on the bank of that
lake, while those women went with the water to the house of
Bhadr&aacute;. And while they were pouring over Bhadr&aacute; the water
of ablution, her ring fell into her lap. When Bhadr&aacute; saw it, she
recognized it and asked those friends of hers whether they had seen any
stranger about. And they gave her this answer; &ldquo;We saw a young
mortal on the banks of the lake, and he lifted this pitcher for
us.&rdquo; Then Bhadr&aacute; said &ldquo;Go and make him bathe and
adorn himself, and quickly bring him here, for he is my husband who has
arrived in this country.&rdquo; When Bhadr&aacute; had said this, her
companions went and told Vid&uacute;shaka the state of the case, and
after he had bathed brought him into her presence. And when he arrived,
he saw after long separation Bhadr&aacute; who was eagerly expecting
him, like the ripe blooming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>fruit of the tree of his own
valour in visible form: she for her part rose up when she saw him, and
offering him the <i lang="sa-latn">argha</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4881src" href="#xd27e4881" name="xd27e4881src">38</a> so to
speak, by sprinkling him with her tears of joy, she fastened her
twining arms round his neck like a garland. When they embraced one
another, the long accumulated affection<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4893src" href="#xd27e4893" name="xd27e4893src">39</a> seemed to
ooze from their limbs in the form of sweat, owing to excessive
pressure. Then they sat down, and never satisfied with gazing at one
another, they both, as it were, endured the agony of longing multiplied
a hundred-fold. Bhadr&aacute; then said to Vid&uacute;shaka; &ldquo;How
did you come to this land?&rdquo; And he thereupon gave her this
answer; &ldquo;Supported by affection for thee, I came here enduring
many risks to my life, what else can I say, fair one?<span class="corr"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When she heard that, seeing that
his love was excessive, as it caused him to disregard his own life,
Bhadr&aacute; said to him who through affection had endured the utmost,
&ldquo;My husband, I care not for my friends, nor my magic powers; you
are my life, and I am your slave, my lord, bought by you with your
virtues.&rdquo; Then Vid&uacute;shaka said, &ldquo;Then come with me to
live in Ujjayin&iacute;, my beloved, leaving all this heavenly
joy.&rdquo; Bhadr&aacute; immediately accepted his proposal, and gave
up all her magic gifts, (which departed from her the moment she formed
that resolution,) with no more regret than if they had been straw. Then
Vid&uacute;shaka rested with her there during that night, being waited
on by her friend Yoge&#347;var&iacute;, and in the morning the
successful hero descended with her from the mountain of the sun-rise,
and again called to mind the R&aacute;kshasa Yamadansh&#7789;ra; the
R&aacute;kshasa came the moment he was thought of, and Vid&uacute;shaka
told him the direction of the journey he had to take, and then ascended
his shoulder, having previously placed Bhadr&aacute; there. She too
endured patiently to be placed on the shoulder of a very loathsome
R&aacute;kshasa; what will not women do when mastered by affection? So
Vid&uacute;shaka, mounted on the R&aacute;kshasa, set out with his
beloved, and again reached the city of K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka; and
there men beheld him with fear inspired by the sight of the
R&aacute;kshasa; and when he saw king &Aacute;ryavarman, he demanded
from him his daughter; and after receiving that princess surrendered by
her father, whom he had won with his arm, he set forth from that city
in the same style, mounted on the R&aacute;kshasa. And after he had
gone some distance, he found that wicked merchant on the shore of the
sea, who long ago cut the ropes when he had been thrown into the sea.
And he took, together with his wealth, his daughter, whom he had before
won as a reward for setting free the ship in the sea. And he considered
the depriving that villain of his wealth as equivalent to putting him
to death, for grovelling souls often value their hoards more than their
life. Then mounted on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>R&aacute;kshasa as on a chariot,
taking with him that daughter of the merchant, he flew up into the
heaven with the princess and Bhadr&aacute;, and journeying through the
air, he crossed the ocean, which like his valour was full of boisterous
impetuosity, exhibiting it to his fair ones.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4904src" href="#xd27e4904" name="xd27e4904src">40</a> And he
again reached the city of Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana, beheld with
astonishment by all as he rode on a R&aacute;kshasa. There he greeted
his wife, the daughter of Devasena, who had long desired his arrival,
whom he had won by the defeat of the R&aacute;kshasa; and though her
father tried to detain him, yet longing for his native land, he took
her also with him, and set out for Ujjayin&iacute;. And owing to the
speed of the R&aacute;kshasa, he soon reached that city, which appeared
like his satisfaction at beholding his home, exhibited in visible form.
There Vid&uacute;shaka was seen by the people, perched on the top of
that huge R&aacute;kshasa, whose vast frame was illuminated by the
beauty of his wives seated on his shoulder, as the moon<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4909src" href="#xd27e4909" name=
"xd27e4909src">41</a> rising over the eastern mountain with gleaming
herbs on its summit. The people being astonished and terrified, his
father-in-law the king &Aacute;dityasena came to hear of it, and went
out from the city. But Vid&uacute;shaka, when he saw him, quickly
descended from the R&aacute;kshasa, and after prostrating himself
approached the king; the king too welcomed him. Then Vid&uacute;shaka
caused all his wives to come down from the shoulder of the
R&aacute;kshasa, and released him to wander where he would. And after
that R&aacute;kshasa had departed, Vid&uacute;shaka accompanied by his
wives entered the king&rsquo;s palace together with the king his
father-in-law. There he delighted by his arrival that first wife of
his, the daughter of that king, who suffered a long regret for his
absence. And when the king said to him; &ldquo;How did you obtain these
wives, and who is that R&aacute;kshasa?&rdquo; he told him the whole
story. Then that king pleased with his son-in-law&rsquo;s valour, and
knowing what it was expedient to do, gave him half his kingdom; and
immediately Vid&uacute;shaka, though a Br&aacute;hman, became a
monarch, with a lofty white umbrella and <i>chowries</i> waving on both
sides of him. And then the city of Ujjayin&iacute; was joyful, full of
the sound of festive drums and music, uttering shouts of delight. Thus
he obtained the mighty rank of a king, and gradually conquered the
whole earth, so that his foot was worshipped by all kings, and with
Bhadr&aacute; for his consort he long lived in happiness with those
wives of his, who were content, having abandoned jealousy. Thus
resolute men when fortune favours them, find their own valour a great
and successful stupefying charm that forcibly draws towards them
prosperity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=

<p class="first">Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a said to the king of
Vatsa; &ldquo;King, it is known that you possess the favour of destiny,
as well as courage; and I also have taken some trouble about the right
course of policy to be pursued in this matter: therefore carry out as
soon as possible your plan of conquering the regions.&rdquo; When his
chief minister had said this to him, the king of Vatsa
answered,&mdash;&ldquo;Admitting that this is true, nevertheless the
accomplishment of auspicious undertakings is always attended with
difficulties, accordingly I will with this object propitiate &#346;iva
by austerities, for without his favour, how can I obtain what I
desire?&rdquo; When they heard that, his ministers approved of his
performing austerities, as the chiefs of the monkeys did in the case of
R&aacute;ma, when he was intent upon building a bridge over the ocean.
And after the king had fasted for three nights, engaged in austerities
with the queens and the ministers, &#346;iva said to him in a
dream&mdash;&ldquo;I am satisfied with thee, therefore rise up, thou
shalt obtain an unimpeded triumph, and shalt soon have a son who shall
be king of all the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; Then the king woke up,
with all his fatigue removed by the favour of &#346;iva, like the new
moon increased by the rays of the sun. And in the morning he delighted
his ministers by telling them that dream, and the two queens, tender as
flowers, who were worn out by the fasting they had endured to fulfil
the vow. And they were refreshed by the description of his dream, well
worthy of being drunk in with the ears, and its effect was like that of
medicine,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4932src" href="#xd27e4932" name=

wives obtained the saintly renown of matrons devoted to their husband.

to conquer your enemies, and then enjoy the prosperity won by your arm.
For when prosperity is acquired by a king&rsquo;s own virtues, it
remains fixed in his family, for blessings acquired by the virtues of
the owners are never lost. And for this reason it was that that
treasure long buried in the ground, which had been accumulated by your
ancestors and then lost, was recovered by you. Moreover with reference

<h3 class="main">Story of Devad&aacute;sa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there was in the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a certain merchant&rsquo;s son, sprung from a
rich family, and his name was Devad&aacute;sa. And he married a wife
from the city of Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana, the daughter of some rich
merchant. When his father died, Devad&aacute;sa became in course of
time addicted to vice, and lost all his wealth at play. And then his
wife&rsquo;s father came and took away to his own house in
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana his daughter, who was distressed by poverty
and the other hardships of her lot. Gradually the husband began to be
afflicted by his misfortunes, and wishing to be set up in his business,
he came to Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana to ask his father-in-law to lend
him the capital which he required. And having arrived in the evening at
the city of Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana, seeing that he was begrimed
with dust, and in tattered garments, he thought to himself, &ldquo;How
can I enter my father-in-law&rsquo;s house in this state? In truth for
a proud man death is preferable to exhibiting poverty before
one&rsquo;s relations.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, he went into the
market-place, and remained outside a certain shop during the night,
crouching with contracted body, like the lotus which is folded at
night. And immediately he saw a certain young merchant open the door of
that shop and enter it. And a moment after he saw a woman come with
noiseless step to that same place, and rapidly enter. And while he
fixed his eyes on the interior of the shop in which a light was
burning, he recognized in that woman his own wife. Then Devad&aacute;sa
seeing that wife of his repairing to another man, and bolting the door,
being smitten with the thunderbolt of grief, thought to himself;
&ldquo;A man deprived of wealth loses even his own body, how then can
he hope to retain the affections of a woman? For women have fickleness
implanted in their nature by an invariable law, like the flashes of
lightning. So here I have an instance of the misfortunes which befall
men who fall into the sea of vice, and of the behaviour of an
independent woman who lives in her father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Thus he
reflected as he stood outside, and he seemed to himself to hear his
wife confidentially conversing with her lover. So he applied his ear to
the door, and that wicked woman was at the moment saying in secret to
the merchant, her paramour; &ldquo;Listen; as I am so fond of you, I
will to-day tell you a secret; my husband long ago had a
great-grandfather named V&iacute;ravarman; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>in
the courtyard of his house he secretly buried in the ground four jars
of gold, one jar in each of the four corners. And he then informed one
of his wives of that fact, and his wife at the time of her death told
her daughter-in-law, she told it to her daughter-in-law who was my
mother-in-law, and my mother-in-law told it to me. So this is an oral
tradition in my husband&rsquo;s family, descending through the
mothers-in-law. But I did not tell it to my husband though he is poor,
for he is odious to me as being addicted to gambling, but you are above
all dear to me. So go to my husband&rsquo;s town and buy the house from
him with money, and after you have obtained that gold, come here and
live happily with me.&rdquo; When the merchant, her paramour, heard
this from that treacherous woman, he was much pleased with her,
thinking that he had obtained a treasure without any trouble.
Devad&aacute;sa for his part, who was outside, bore henceforth the hope
of wealth, so to speak, riveted in his heart with those piercing words
of his wicked wife. So he went thence quickly to the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and after reaching his house, he took that
treasure and appropriated it. Then that merchant, who was in secret the
paramour of his wife, arrived in that country, on pretence of trading,
but in reality eager to obtain the treasure. So he bought that house
from Devad&aacute;sa, who made it over to him for a large sum of money.
Then Devad&aacute;sa set up another home, and cunningly brought back
that wife of his from the house of his father-in-law. When this had
been done, that wicked merchant, who was the lover of his wife, not
having obtained the treasure, came and said to him; &ldquo;This house
of yours is old, and I do not like it. So give me back my money, and
take back your own house.&rdquo; Thus he demanded, and Devad&aacute;sa
refused, and being engaged in a violent altercation, they both went
before the king. In his presence Devad&aacute;sa poured forth the whole
story of his wife, painful to him as venom concealed in his breast.
Then the king had his wife summoned, and after ascertaining the truth
of the case, he punished that adulterous merchant with the loss of all
his property; Devad&aacute;sa for his part cut off the nose of that
wicked wife, and married another, and then lived happily in his native
city on the treasure he had obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus treasure obtained by virtuous methods is continued to a
man&rsquo;s posterity, but treasure of another kind is as easily melted
away as a flake of snow when the rain begins to fall. Therefore a man
should endeavour to obtain wealth by lawful methods, but a king
especially, since wealth is the root of the tree of empire. So honour
all your ministers according to custom in order that you may obtain
success, and then accomplish the conquest of the regions, so as to gain
opulence in addition to virtue. For out of regard to the fact that you
are allied by marriage with your two powerful fathers-in-law, few kings
will oppose you, most will join you. However, this king of Benares
named Brahmadatta is always your enemy, therefore <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>conquer him first; when he is conquered, conquer
the eastern quarter, and gradually all the quarters, and exalt the
glory of the race of P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u gleaming white like a
lotus.&rdquo; When his chief minister said this to him, the king of
Vatsa consented, eager for conquest, and ordered his subjects to
prepare for the expedition; and he gave the sovereignty of the country
of Videha to his brother-in-law Gop&aacute;laka, by way of reward for
his assistance, thereby shewing his knowledge of policy; and he gave to
Sinhavarman the brother of Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, who came to his
assistance with his forces, the land of Chedi, treating him with great
respect; and the monarch summoned Pulindaka the friendly king of the
Bhillas,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4951src" href="#xd27e4951" name=
"xd27e4951src">2</a> who filled the quarters with his hordes, as the
rainy season fills them with clouds; and while the preparation for the
expedition was going on in the great king&rsquo;s territories, a
strange anxiety was produced in the heart of his enemies; but
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a first sent spies to Benares to find out
the proceedings of king Brahmadatta; then on an auspicious day, being
cheered with omens portending victory, the king of Vatsa first marched
against Brahmadatta in the Eastern quarter, having mounted<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4956src" href="#xd27e4956" name="xd27e4956src">3</a>
a tall victorious elephant, with a lofty umbrella on its back, as a
furious lion ascends a mountain with one tree in full bloom on it. And
his expedition was facilitated<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4962src"
href="#xd27e4962" name="xd27e4962src">4</a> by the autumn which arrived
as a harbinger of good fortune, and shewed him an easy path, across
rivers flowing with diminished volume, and he filled the face of the
land with his shouting forces, so as to produce the appearance of a
sudden rainy season without clouds; and then the cardinal points
resounding with the echoes of the roaring of his host, seemed to be
telling one another their fears of his coming, and his horses,
collecting the brightness of the sun on their golden trappings, moved
along followed, as it were, by the fire pleased with the purification
of his army.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4971src" href="#xd27e4971"
name="xd27e4971src">5</a></p>
<p>And his elephants with their ears like white <i>chowries</i>, and
with streams of ichor flowing from their temples reddened by being
mixed with vermilion, appeared, as he marched along, like the sons of
the mountains, streaked with white clouds of autumn, and pouring down
streams of water coloured with red mineral, sent by the parent hills,
in their fear, to join his expedition. And the dust from the earth
concealed the brightness of the sun, as if thinking that the king could
not endure the effulgent splendour of rivals. And the two queens
followed the king step by step on the way, like the goddess of Fame,
and the Fortune of Victory, attracted by his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>politic virtues.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4983src" href="#xd27e4983" name="xd27e4983src">6</a> The silk of
his host&rsquo;s banners, tossed to and fro in the wind, seemed to say
to his enemies,&mdash;&ldquo;Bend in submission, or flee.&rdquo; Thus
he marched, beholding the districts full of blown white lotuses, like
the uplifted hoods of the serpent &#346;esha<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4986src" href="#xd27e4986" name="xd27e4986src">7</a> terrified
with fear of the destruction of the world. In the meanwhile those
spies, commissioned by Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, assuming the vows
of scull-bearing worshippers of &#346;iva, reached the city of Benares.
And one of them, who was acquainted with the art of juggling,
exhibiting his skill, assumed the part of teacher, and the others
passed themselves off as his pupils. And they celebrated that pretended
teacher, who subsisted on alms, from place to place, saying,
&ldquo;This master of ours is acquainted with past, present, and
future.&rdquo; Whatever that sage predicted, in the way of fires and so
on, to those who came to consult him about the future, his pupils took
care to bring about secretly; so he became famous. He gained complete
ascendancy over the mind of a certain R&aacute;jp&uacute;t courtier
there, a favourite of the king&rsquo;s, who was won over by this mean
skill of the teacher&rsquo;s. And when the war with the king of Vatsa
came on, the king Brahmadatta began to consult him by the agency of the
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, so that he learnt the secrets of the government.
Then the minister of Brahmadatta, Yogakara&#7751;&#7693;aka, laid
snares in the path of the king of Vatsa as he advanced. He tainted, by
means of poison and other deleterious substances, the trees, flowering
creepers, water and grass all along the line of march. And he sent
poison-damsels<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4989src" href="#xd27e4989"
name="xd27e4989src">8</a> as dancing girls among the enemy&rsquo;s
host, and he also despatched nocturnal assassins into their midst. But
that spy, who had assumed the character of a prophet, found all this
out, and then quickly informed Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a of it by
means of his companions. Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a for his part,
when he found it out, purified at every step along the line of march
the poisoned grass, water, and so on, by means of corrective antidotes,
and forbade in the camp the society of strange women, and with the help
of Ruma&#7751;vat he captured and put to death those assassins. When he
heard of that, Brahmadatta having found all his stratagems fail, came
to the conclusion that the king of Vatsa, who filled with his forces
the whole country, was hard to overcome. After deliberating and sending
an ambassador, he came in person to the king of Vatsa who was encamped
near, placing his clasped hands upon his head in token of submission.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king of Vatsa for his part, when the king of Benares came to
him, bringing a present, received him with respect and kindness, for
heroes love submission. He being thus subdued, that mighty king went on
pacifying the East, making the yielding bend, but extirpating the
obstinate, as the wind treats the trees, until he reached the Eastern
ocean, rolling with quivering waves, as it were, trembling with terror
on account of the Ganges having been conquered. On its extreme shore he
set up a pillar of victory,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4996src" href=
"#xd27e4996" name="xd27e4996src">9</a> looking like the king of the
serpents emerging from the world below to crave immunity for
P&aacute;t&aacute;la. Then the people of Kalinga<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5001src" href="#xd27e5001" name="xd27e5001src">10</a> submitted
and paid tribute, and acted as the king&rsquo;s guides, so that the
renown of that renowned one ascended the mountain of Mahendra. Having
conquered a forest of kings by means of his elephants, which seemed
like the peaks of the Vindhya come to him terrified at the conquest of
Mahendra, he went to the southern quarter. There he made his enemies
cease their threatening murmurs and take to the mountains,
strengthless<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5006src" href="#xd27e5006"
name="xd27e5006src">11</a> and pale, treating them as the season of
autumn treats the clouds. The K&aacute;ver&iacute; being crossed by him
in his victorious onset, and the glory of the king of the
Chola<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5012src" href="#xd27e5012" name=
"xd27e5012src">12</a> race being surpassed, were befouled at the same
time. He no longer allowed the Muralas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5024src" href="#xd27e5024" name="xd27e5024src">13</a> to exalt
their heads, for they were completely beaten down by tributes imposed
on them. Though his elephants drank the waters of the
God&aacute;var&iacute; divided into seven streams, they seemed to
discharge them again seven-fold in the form of ichor. Then the king
crossed the Rev&aacute; and reached Ujjayin&iacute;, and entered the
city, being made by king Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena to precede
him. And there he became the target of the amorous sidelong glances of
the ladies of M&aacute;lava, who shine with twofold beauty by loosening
their braided hair and wearing garlands, and he remained there in great
comfort, hospitably entertained by his father-in-law, so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>that
he even forgot the long-regretted enjoyments of his native land. And
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; was continually at her parents&rsquo; side,
remembering her childhood, seeming despondent even in her happiness.
The king Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena was as much delighted at
meeting Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, as he was at meeting again his own
daughter. But after he had rested some days, the delighted king of
Vatsa, reinforced by the troops of his father-in-law, marched towards
the western region; his curved sword<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5033src" href="#xd27e5033" name="xd27e5033src">14</a> was surely
the smoke of the fire of his valour, since it dimmed with gushing tears
the eyes of the women of L&aacute;&#7789;a; the mountain of Mandara,
when its woods were broken through by his elephants, seemed to tremble
lest he should root it up to churn the sea.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5038src" href="#xd27e5038" name="xd27e5038src">15</a> Surely he
was a splendid luminary excelling the sun and other orbs, since in his
victorious career he enjoyed a glorious rising even in the western
quarter. Then he went to Alak&aacute;, distinguished by the presence of
Kuvera, displaying its beauties before him, that is to say, to the
quarter made lovely by the smile of Kail&aacute;sa, and having subdued
the king of Sindh, at the head of his cavalry he destroyed the
Mlechchhas as R&aacute;ma destroyed the R&aacute;kshasas at the head of
the army of monkeys; the cavalry squadrons of the Turushkas<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5044src" href="#xd27e5044" name=
"xd27e5044src">16</a> were broken on the masses of his elephants, as
the waves of the agitated sea on the woods that line the sea-shore. The
august hero received the tribute of his foes, and cut off the head of
the wicked king of the P&aacute;ras&iacute;kas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5050src" href="#xd27e5050" name="xd27e5050src">17</a> as
Vish&#7751;u did that of R&aacute;hu.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5053src" href="#xd27e5053" name="xd27e5053src">18</a> His glory,
after he had inflicted a defeat on the H&uacute;&#7751;as<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5057src" href="#xd27e5057" name=
"xd27e5057src">19</a>, made the four quarters resound, and poured down
the Him&aacute;laya like a second Ganges. When the hosts of the
monarch, whose enemies were still from fear, were shouting, a hostile
answer was heard only in the hollows of the rocks. It is not strange
that then the king of K&aacute;mar&uacute;pa,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5060src" href="#xd27e5060" name="xd27e5060src">20</a> bending
before him with head deprived of the umbrella, was without shade and
also without brightness. Then that sovereign returned, followed by
elephants presented by the king of K&aacute;mar&uacute;pa, resembling
moving rocks made over to him by the mountains by way of tribute.
Having thus conquered the earth, the king of Vatsa with his attendants
reached the city of the king of Magadha the father of
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. But the king of Magadha, when he arrived with
the queens, was as joyous as the god of love when the moon illuminates
the night. V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who had lived with him before
without being recognised, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>was now made known to him, and he
considered her deserving of the highest regard.</p>
<p>Then that victorious king of Vatsa, having been honoured by the king
of Magadha with his whole city, followed by the minds of all the people
which pursued him out of affection, having swallowed the surface of the
earth with his mighty army, returned to L&aacute;v&aacute;naka in his
own dominions.</p>

<p class="first">Then the king of Vatsa, while encamped in
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka to rest his army, said in secret to
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, &ldquo;Through your sagacity I have
conquered all the kings upon the earth, and they being won over by
politic devices will not conspire against me. But this king of Benares,
Brahmadatta, is an ill-conditioned fellow, and he alone, I think, will
plot against me; what confidence can be reposed in the
wicked-minded?&rdquo; Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, being spoken
to in this strain by the king, answered, &ldquo;O king, Brahmadatta
will not plot against you again, for when he was conquered and
submitted, you shewed him great consideration; and what sensible man
will injure one who treats him well? Whoever does, will find that it

<h3 class="main">Story of Phalabh&uacute;ti.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once on a time in the land of Padma an
excellent Br&aacute;hman of high renown, named Agnidatta, who lived on
a grant of land given by the king. He had born to him two sons, the
elder named Somadatta, and the second Vai&#347;v&aacute;naradatta. The
elder of them was of fine person, but ignorant, and ill-conducted, but
the second was sagacious, well-conducted, and fond of study. And those
two after they were married, and their father had died, divided that
royal grant and the rest of his possessions between them, each taking
half; and the younger of the two was honoured by the king, but the
elder Somadatta, who was of unsteady character, remained a husbandman.
One day a Br&aacute;hman, who had been a friend of his father&rsquo;s,
seeing him engaged in conversation with some &#346;&uacute;dras, thus
addressed him, &ldquo;Though you are the son of Agnidatta, you behave
like a &#346;&uacute;dra, you blockhead, and you are not ashamed,
though you see your own brother in favour with the king.&rdquo;
Somadatta, when he heard that, flew into a passion, and forgetting the
respect due to the old man, ran upon him, and gave him a kick. Then the
Br&aacute;hman, enraged on account of the kick, immediately called on
some other Br&aacute;hmans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>to bear witness to it, and went
and complained to the king. The king sent out soldiers to take
Somadatta prisoner, but they, when they went out, were slain by his
friends, who had taken up arms. Then the king sent out a second force,
and captured Somadatta, and blinded by wrath ordered him to be impaled.
Then that Br&aacute;hman, as he was being lifted on to the stake,
suddenly fell to the ground, as if he were flung down by somebody. And
those executioners, when preparing to lift him on again, became blind,
for the fates protect one who is destined to be prosperous. The king,
as soon as he heard of the occurrence, was pleased, and being entreated
by the younger brother, spared the life of Somadatta; then Somadatta,
having escaped death, desired to go to another land with his wife on
account of the insulting treatment of the king, and when his relations
in a body disapproved of his departure, he determined to live without
the half of the king&rsquo;s grant, which he resigned; then, finding no
other means of support, he desired to practise husbandry, and went to
the forest on a lucky day to find a piece of ground suitable for it.
There he found a promising piece of ground, from which it seemed likely
that an abundant crop could be produced, and in the middle of it he saw
an A&#347;vattha tree of great size. Desiring ground fit for
cultivation, and seeing that tree to be cool like the rainy season, as
it kept off the rays of the sun with its auspicious thick shade, he was
much delighted. He said, &ldquo;I am a faithful votary of that being,
whoever he may be, that presides over this tree,&rdquo; and walking
round the tree so as to keep it on his right, he bowed before
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5082src" href="#xd27e5082" name=
"xd27e5082src">1</a> Then he yoked a pair of bullocks, and recited a
prayer for success, and after making an oblation to that tree, he began
to plough there. And he remained under that tree night and day, and his
wife always brought him his meals there. And in course of time, when
the corn was ripe that piece of ground was, as fate would have it,
unexpectedly plundered by the troops of a hostile kingdom. Then the
hostile force having departed, the courageous man, though his corn was
destroyed, comforted his weeping wife, gave her the little that
remained, and after making an offering as before, remained in the same
place, under the same tree. For that is the character of resolute men,
that their perseverance is increased by misfortune. Then one night,
when he was sleepless from anxiety and alone, a voice came out from
that A&#347;vattha tree, &ldquo;O Somadatta, I am pleased with thee,
therefore go to the kingdom of a king named &Aacute;dityaprabha in the
land of &#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha; continually repeat at the
door of that king, (after reciting the form of words used at the
evening oblation to Agni,) the following sentence&mdash;&lsquo;I am
Phalabh&uacute;ti by name, a Br&aacute;hman, hear what I say: he who
does good will obtain good, and he who does evil, will obtain
evil;&rsquo;&mdash;by repeating this there thou shalt attain great
prosperity; and now learn from me the form of words <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>used
at the evening oblation to Agni; I am a Yaksha.&rdquo; Having said
this, and having immediately taught him by his power the form of words
used in the evening oblation, the voice in the tree ceased. And the
next morning the wise Somadatta set out with his wife, having received
the name of Phalabh&uacute;ti by imposition of the Yaksha, and after
crossing various forests uneven and labyrinthine as his own
calamities,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5092src" href="#xd27e5092" name=
"xd27e5092src">2</a> he reached the land of
&#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha. There he recited at the king&rsquo;s
door the form of words used at the evening oblation, and then he
announced, as he had been directed, his name as Phalabh&uacute;ti, and
uttered the following speech which excited the curiosity of the people,
&ldquo;The doer of good will obtain good, but the doer of evil,
evil.&rdquo; And after he had said this frequently, the king
&Aacute;dityaprabha, being full of curiosity, caused Phalabh&uacute;ti
to be brought into the palace, and he entered, and over and over again
repeated that same speech in the presence of the king. That made the
king and all his courtiers laugh. And the king and his chiefs gave him
garments and ornaments, and also villages, for the amusement of great
men is not without fruit; and so Phalabh&uacute;ti, having been
originally poor, immediately obtained by the favour of the
Guhyaka<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5104src" href="#xd27e5104" name=
"xd27e5104src">3</a> wealth bestowed by the king; and by continually
reciting the words mentioned above, he became a special favourite of
the monarch for the regal mind loves diversion. And gradually he
attained to a position of love and respect in the palace, in the
kingdom, and in the female apartments, as being beloved by the king.
One day that king &Aacute;dityaprabha returned from hunting in the
forest, and quickly entered his harem; his suspicions were aroused by
the confusion of the warders, and when he entered, he saw the queen
named Kuvalay&aacute;val&iacute; engaged in worshipping the gods, stark
naked,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5108src" href="#xd27e5108" name=
"xd27e5108src">4</a> with her hair standing on end, and her eyes
half-closed, with a large patch of red lead upon her forehead, with her
lips trembling in muttering charms, in the midst of a great
circle<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5111src" href="#xd27e5111" name=
"xd27e5111src">5</a> strewed with various coloured powders, after
offering a horrible oblation of blood, spirits, and human flesh. She
for her part, when the king entered, in her confusion seized her
garments, and when questioned by him immediately answered, after
craving pardon for what she had done, &ldquo;I have gone through this
ceremony in order that you might obtain prosperity, and now, my lord,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=

<p class="first">Long ago, when I was living in my father&rsquo;s

me; &ldquo;Why do you ask such a question? Without worshipping him no

<h3 class="main">Story of the birth of K&aacute;rtikeya.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, when Indra oppressed by T&aacute;raka was
desirous or obtaining a son from &#346;iva to act as general of the
gods, and the god of love had been consumed,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5145src" href="#xd27e5145" name="xd27e5145src">6</a> Gaur&iacute;
by performing austerities sought and gained as a husband the three-eyed
god, who was engaged in a very long and terrible course of
mortification. Then she desired the obtaining of a son, and the return
to life of the god of love, but she did not remember to worship
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a in order to gain her end. So, when his beloved asked
that her desire should be granted, &#346;iva said to her, &ldquo;My
dear goddess, the god of love was born long ago from the mind of
Brahm&aacute;, and no sooner was he born than he said in his insolence,
&lsquo;Whom shall I make mad? (<i lang="sa-latn">kan
darpay&aacute;mi</i>).&rsquo; So Brahm&aacute; called him Kandarpa, and
said to him, &lsquo;Since thou art very confident, my son, avoid
attacking &#346;iva only, lest thou receive death from him.&rsquo;
Though the Creator gave him this warning, the ill-disposed god came to
trouble my austerities, therefore he was burnt up by me, and he cannot
be created again with his body.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5153src"
href="#xd27e5153" name="xd27e5153src">7</a> But I will create by my
power a son from you, for I do not require the might of love in order
to have offspring as mortals do.&rdquo; While the god, whose ensign is
a bull,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5159src" href="#xd27e5159" name=
"xd27e5159src">8</a> was saying this to P&aacute;rvat&iacute;,
Brahm&aacute; accompanied by Indra appeared before him; and when he had
been praised by them, and entreated to bring about the destruction of
the Asura T&aacute;raka, &#346;iva consented to beget on the goddess a
son of his body. And, at their entreaty, he consented that the god of
love should be born without body in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the minds of animate
creatures, to prevent the destruction of created beings. And he gave
permission to love to influence his own mind; pleased with that, the
Creator went away and P&aacute;rvat&iacute; was delighted. But when,
after the lapse of hundreds of years, there appeared no hope of
P&aacute;rvat&iacute; having any offspring, the god by the order of
Brahm&aacute; called to mind Agni; Agni for his part, the moment they
called him to mind, thinking that the foe of the god of love was
irresistible, and afraid to interfere, fled from the gods and entered
the water; but the frogs being burned by his heat told the gods, who
were searching for him, that he was in the water; then Agni by his
curse immediately made the speech of the frogs thenceforth
inarticulate, and again disappearing fled to a place of refuge. There
the gods found him, concealed in the trunk of a tree, in the form of a
snail, for he was betrayed by the elephants and parrots, and he
appeared to them. And after making by a curse the tongues of the
parrots and the elephants incapable of clear utterance, he promised to
do what the gods requested, having been praised by them. So he went to
&#346;iva, and after inclining humbly before him, through fear of being
cursed, he informed him of the commission the gods had given him.
&#346;iva thereupon deposited the embryo in the fire. Then the goddess
distracted with anger and grief, said, &ldquo;I have not obtained a son
from you after all,&rdquo; and &#346;iva said to her; &ldquo;An
obstacle has arisen in this matter, because you neglected to worship
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, the lord of obstacles; therefore adore him now in
order that a child may be born to us of the fire.&rdquo; When thus
addressed by &#346;iva, the goddess worshipped Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, and
the fire became pregnant with that germ of &#346;iva. Then, bearing
that embryo of &#346;iva, the fire shone even in the day as if the sun
had entered into it. And then it discharged into the Ganges the germ
difficult to bear, and the Ganges, by the order of &#346;iva, placed it
in a sacrificial cavity on mount Meru.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5167src" href="#xd27e5167" name="xd27e5167src">9</a> There that
germ was watched by the Ga&#7751;as, &#346;iva&rsquo;s attendants, and
after a thousand years had developed it, it became a boy with six
faces. Then, drinking milk with his six mouths from the breasts of the
six K&#7771;ittik&aacute;s<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5170src" href=
"#xd27e5170" name="xd27e5170src">10</a> appointed by Gaur&iacute; to
nurse him, the boy grew big in a few days. In the meanwhile, the king
of the gods, overcome by the Asura T&aacute;raka, fled to the difficult
peaks of mount Meru, abandoning the field of battle. And the gods
together with the &#7770;ishis went to the six-mouthed K&aacute;rtikeya
for protection, and he, defending the gods, remained surrounded by
them. When Indra heard that, he was troubled, considering that his
kingdom was taken from him, and being jealous he went and made war upon
K&aacute;rtikeya. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>from the body of K&aacute;rtikeya,
when struck by the thunderbolt of Indra, there sprang two sons called
&#346;&aacute;kha and Vi&#347;&aacute;kha, both of incomparable might.
Then &#346;iva came to his offspring K&aacute;rtikeya, who exceeded
Indra in might, and forbade him and his two sons to fight, and rebuked
him in the following words: &ldquo;Thou wast born in order that thou
mightest slay T&aacute;raka and protect the realm of Indra, therefore
do thy own duty.&rdquo; Then Indra was delighted and immediately bowed
before him, and commenced the ceremony of consecrating by ablutions
K&aacute;rtikeya as general of his forces. But when he himself lifted
the pitcher for that purpose, his arm became stiff, wherefore he was
despondent, but &#346;iva said to him; &ldquo;Thou didst not worship
the elephant-faced god, when thou desiredst a general; it was for this
reason that thou hast met with this obstacle, therefore adore him
now.&rdquo; Indra, when he heard that, did so, and his arm was set
free, and he duly performed the joyful ceremony of consecrating the
general. And not long after, the general slew the Asura T&aacute;raka,
and the gods rejoiced at having accomplished their object, and
Gaur&iacute; at having obtained a son. So, princess, you see even the
gods are not successful without honouring Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, therefore
adore him when you desire a blessing.</p>
<p>After hearing this from my companions I went, my husband, and
worshipped an image of Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, that stood in a lonely part
of the garden, and after I had finished the worship, I suddenly saw
that those companions of mine had flown up by their own power and were
disporting themselves in the fields of the air; when I saw that, out of
curiosity I called them and made them come down from the heaven, and
when I asked them about the nature of their magic power, they
immediately gave me this answer; &ldquo;These are the magic powers of
witches&rsquo; spells, and they are due to the eating of human flesh,
and our teacher in this is a Br&aacute;hman woman known by the name of
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri.&rdquo; When my companions said this to me, I
being desirous of acquiring the power of a woman that can fly in the
air, but afraid of eating human flesh, was for a time in a state of
hesitation; then eager to possess that power, I said to those friends
of mine, &ldquo;Cause me also to be instructed in this science.&rdquo;
And immediately they went and brought, in accordance with my request,
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri, who was of repulsive appearance. Her eyebrows
met,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5179src" href="#xd27e5179" name=
"xd27e5179src">11</a> she had dull eyes, a depressed flat nose, large
cheeks, widely parted lips, projecting teeth, a long neck, pendulous
breasts, a large belly, and broad expanded feet. She appeared as if the
creator had made her as a specimen of his skill in producing ugliness.
When I fell at her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>feet, after bathing and worshipping
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, she made me take off my clothes and perform,
standing in a circle, a horrible ceremony in honour of &#346;iva in his
terrific form, and after she had sprinkled me with water, she gave me
various spells known to her, and human flesh to eat that had been
offered in sacrifice to the gods; so, after I had eaten man&rsquo;s
flesh and had received the various spells, I immediately flew up, naked
as I was, into the heaven with my friends, and after I had amused
myself, I descended from the heaven by command of my teacher, and I,
the princess, went to my own apartments. Thus even in my girlhood I
became one of the society of witches, and in our meetings we devoured
the bodies of many men.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Sundaraka.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But listen, king, to a story which is a digression
from my main tale. That K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri had for husband a
Br&aacute;hman of the name of Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min, and he, being
an instructor in that country, taught many pupils who came from
different lands, as he was skilful in the exposition of the Vedas. And
among his pupils he had one young man of the name of Sundaraka, the
beauty of whose person was set off by his excellent character; one day
the teacher&rsquo;s wife K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri being love-sick
secretly courted him, her husband having gone away to some place or
other. Truly Love makes great sport with ugly people as his
laughing-stocks, in that she, not considering her own appearance, fell
in love with Sundaraka. But he, though tempted, detested with his whole
soul the crime; however women may misbehave, the mind of the good is
not to be shaken. Then, he having departed, K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri in
a rage tore her own body with bites and scratches, and she remained
weeping,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5199src" href="#xd27e5199" name=
"xd27e5199src">12</a> with dress and locks disordered, until the
teacher Vish&#7751;usv&aacute;min entered the house. And when he had
entered, she said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Look, my Lord, to this state has
Sundaraka reduced me, endeavouring to gain possession of me by
force.&rdquo; As soon as the teacher heard that, he was inflamed with
anger, for confidence in women robs even wise men of their power of
reflection; and when Sundaraka returned home at night, he ran upon him,
and he and his pupils kicked him, and struck him with fists, and
sticks; moreover when he was senseless with the blows, he ordered his
pupils to fling him out in the road by night, without regard to his
safety, and they did so. Then Sundaraka was gradually restored to
consciousness by the cool night breeze, and seeing himself thus
outraged he reflected, &ldquo;Alas! the instigation of a woman troubles
the minds even of those men whose souls are not under the dominion of
passion, as a storm disturbs the repose of lakes which are not reached
by dust.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5208src" href="#xd27e5208" name=
"xd27e5208src">13</a> This is why that teacher of mine in the excess of
his anger, though old and wise, was so inconsiderate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>as
to treat me so cruelly. But the fact is, lust and wrath are appointed
in the dispensation of fate, from the very birth even of wise
Br&aacute;hmans, to be the two bolts on the door of their
salvation.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5215src" href="#xd27e5215" name=
"xd27e5215src">14</a> For were not the sages long ago angry with
&#346;iva in the <i>devad&aacute;ru</i>-wood, being afraid that their
wives would go astray? And they did not know that he was a god, as he
had assumed the appearance of a Buddhist mendicant, with the intention
of shewing Um&aacute; that even &#7770;ishis do not possess
self-restraint. But after they had cursed him, they discovered that he
was the ruling god, that shakes the three worlds, and they fled to him
for protection. So it appears that even hermits injure others, when
beguiled by the six faults that are enemies of man,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5224src" href="#xd27e5224" name="xd27e5224src">15</a> lust,
wrath, and their crew, much more so Br&aacute;hmans learned in the
Vedas.&rdquo; Thinking thus, Sundaraka from fear of robbers during the
night, climbed up and took shelter in a neighbouring cow-house. And
while he was crouching unobserved in a corner of that cow-house,
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri came into it with a drawn sword in her
hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5229src" href="#xd27e5229" name=
"xd27e5229src">16</a> terrible from the hissing she uttered, with wind
and flames issuing from her mouth and eyes, accompanied by a crowd of
witches. Then the terrified Sundaraka, beholding
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri arriving in such a guise, called to mind the
spells that drive away R&aacute;kshasas, and bewildered by these spells
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri did not see him crouching secretly in a corner,
with his limbs drawn together from fear. Then <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e5238" title=
"Source: K&aacute;lar&aacute;t&#7771;i">K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri</span>
with her friends recited the spells that enable witches to fly, and
they flew up into the air, cow-house and all.</p>
<p>And Sundaraka heard the spell and remembered it;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5243src" href="#xd27e5243" name="xd27e5243src">17</a> but
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri with the cow-house quickly flew through the air
to Ujjayin&iacute;: there she made it descend by a spell in a garden of
herbs, and went and sported in the cemetery among the witches: and
immediately Sundaraka being hungry went down into the garden of herbs,
and made a meal on some roots which he dug up, and after he had allayed
the pangs of hunger, and returned as before to the cow-house,
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri came back in the middle of the night from her
meeting. Then she got up into the cow-house, and, just as before, she
flew through the air with her pupils by the power of her magic, and
returned home in the night. And after she had replaced the cow-house,
which she made use of as a vehicle, in its original situation, and had
dismissed those followers of hers, she entered her sleeping apartment.
And Sundaraka, having thus passed through that night, astonished at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>troubles he had undergone, in the morning left
the cow-house and went to his friends; there he related what had
happened to him, and, though desirous of going to some other country,
he was comforted by those friends and took up his abode among them, and
leaving the dwelling of his teacher, and taking his meals in the
almshouse for Br&aacute;hmans, he lived there enjoying himself at will
in the society of his friends. One day K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri, having
gone out to buy some necessaries for her house, saw Sundaraka in the
market. And being once more love-sick, she went up to him and said to
him a second time&mdash;&ldquo;Sundaraka, shew me affection even now,
for my life depends on you.&rdquo; When she said this to him, the
virtuous Sundaraka said to her, &ldquo;Do not speak thus, it is not
right; you are my mother, as being the wife of my teacher.&rdquo; Then
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri said; &ldquo;If you know what is right, then
grant me my life, for what righteousness is greater than the saving of
life?&rdquo; Then Sundaraka said&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, do not entertain
this wish, for what righteousness can there be in approaching the bed
of my preceptor.&rdquo; Thus repulsed by him, and threatening him in
her wrath, she went home, after tearing her upper garment with her own
hand, and shewing the garment to her husband, she said to him,
&ldquo;Look, Sundaraka ran upon me, and tore this garment of mine in
this fashion;&rdquo; so her husband went in his anger and stopped
Sundaraka&rsquo;s supply of food at the almshouse, by saying that he
was a felon who deserved death. Then Sundaraka in disgust, being
desirous of leaving that country, and knowing the spell for flying up
into the air which he had learnt in the cow-house, but being conscious
that he had forgotten, after hearing it, the spell for descending from
the sky, which he had been taught there also, again went in the night
to that deserted cow-house, and while he was there,
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri came as before, and flying up in the cow-house
in the same way as on the former occasion, travelled through the air to
Ujjayin&iacute;, and having made the cow-house descend by a spell in
the garden of herbs, went again to the cemetery to perform her nightly
ceremonies.</p>
<p>And Sundaraka heard that spell again, but failed again to retain it;
for how can magic practices be thoroughly learnt without explanation by
a teacher? Then he ate some roots there, and put some others in the
cow-house to take away with him, and remained there as before; then
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri came, and climbing up into the cow-house, flew
through the air by night, and stopping the vehicle, entered her house.
In the morning Sundaraka also left that house, and taking the roots
with him he went to the market in order to procure money with which to
purchase food. And while he was selling them there, some servants of
the king&rsquo;s, who were natives of M&aacute;lava, took them away
without paying for them, seeing that they were the produce of their own
country. Then he began to remonstrate angrily, so they manacled him,
and took him before the king on a charge of throwing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>stones at them, and his friends followed him.
Those villains said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;This man, when we asked
him how he managed continually to bring roots from M&aacute;lava and
sell them in Ujjayin&iacute;, would not give us any answer, on the
contrary he threw stones at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard this, he asked him about that marvel,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5265src" href="#xd27e5265" name=
"xd27e5265src">18</a> then his friends said&mdash;&ldquo;If he is
placed on the palace with us, he will explain the whole wonder, but not
otherwise.&rdquo; The king consented, and Sundaraka was placed on the
palace, whereupon by the help of the spell he suddenly flew up into the
heaven with the palace. And travelling on it with his friends, he
gradually reached Pray&aacute;ga,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5271src"
href="#xd27e5271" name="xd27e5271src">19</a> and being now weary he saw
a certain king bathing there, and after stopping the palace there, he
plunged from the heaven into the Ganges, and, beheld with wonder by
all, he approached that king. The king inclining before him, said to
him, &ldquo;Who art thou, and why hast thou descended from
heaven?&rdquo; Sundaraka answered, &ldquo;I am an attendant of the god
&#346;iva, named Murajaka, and by his command I have come to thee
desiring human pleasures.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he supposed
it was true, and gave him a city, rich in corn, filled with jewels,
with women and all the insignia of rank. Then Sundaraka entered that
city and flew up into the heaven with his followers, and for a long
time roamed about at will, free from poverty. Lying on a golden bed,
and fanned with <i>chowries</i> by beautiful women, he enjoyed
happiness like that of Indra. Then once on a time a Siddha, that roamed
in the air, with whom he had struck up a friendship, gave him a spell
for descending from the air, and Sundaraka, having become possessed of
this spell enabling him to come down to earth, descended from the
sky-path in his own city of K&aacute;nyakubja. Then the king hearing
that he had come down from heaven, possessed of full prosperity, with a
city, went in person to meet him out of curiosity, and Sundaraka, when
recognized and questioned, knowing what to say on all occasions,
informed the king of all his own adventures brought about by
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri. Then the king sent for K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri
and questioned her, and she fearlessly confessed her improper conduct,
and the king was angry and made up his mind to cut off her ears, but
she, when seized, disappeared before the eyes of all the spectators.
Then the king forbade her to live in his kingdom, and Sundaraka having
been honourably treated by him returned to the air.</p>
<p>Having said this to her husband the king &Aacute;dityaprabha, the
queen Kuvalay&aacute;val&iacute; went on to say; &ldquo;King, such
magic powers, produced by the spells of witches, do exist, and this
thing happened in my father&rsquo;s kingdom, and it is famous in the
world, and, as I told you at first, I am a pupil of
K&aacute;lar&aacute;tri&rsquo;s, but because I am devoted to my
husband, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>possess greater power even than she did. And
to-day you saw me just at the time when I had performed ceremonies to
ensure your welfare, and was endeavouring to attract by a spell a man
to offer as a victim. So do you enter now into our practice, and set
your foot on the head of all kings, conquering them by magic power.
When he heard this proposal, the king at first rejected it, saying,
&ldquo;What propriety is there in a king&rsquo;s connecting himself
with the eating of human flesh, the practice of witches?&rdquo; But
when the queen was bent on committing suicide, he consented, for how
can men who are attracted by the objects of passion remain in the good
path? Then she made him enter into the circle previously consecrated,
and said to the king, after he had taken an oath; &ldquo;I attempted to
draw hither as a victim that Br&aacute;hman named Phalabh&uacute;ti,
who is so intimate with you, but the drawing him hither is a difficult
task, so it is the best way to initiate some cook in our rites, that he
may himself slay him and cook him. And you must not feel any
compunction about it, because by eating a sacrificial offering of his
flesh, after the ceremonies are complete, the enchantment will be
perfect, for he is a Br&aacute;hman of the highest caste.&rdquo; When
his beloved said this to him, the king, though afraid of the sin, a
second time consented. Alas! terrible is compliance with women! Then
that royal couple had the cook summoned, whose name was
S&aacute;hasika, and after encouraging him, and initiating him, they
both said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever comes to you to-morrow morning
and says&mdash;&lsquo;The king and queen will eat together to-day, so
get some food ready quickly,&rsquo; him you must slay, and make for us
secretly a savoury dish of his flesh.&rdquo; When the cook heard this,
he consented, and went to his own house. And the next morning, when
Phalabh&uacute;ti arrived, the king said to him, &ldquo;Go and tell the
cook S&aacute;hasika in the kitchen, &lsquo;the king together with the
queen will eat to-day a savoury mess, therefore prepare as soon as
possible a splendid dish.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Phalabh&uacute;ti said,
&ldquo;I will do so&rdquo; and went out. When he was outside, the
prince whose name was Chandraprabha, came to him, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Have made for me this very day with this gold a pair
of earrings, like those you had made before for my noble father.&rdquo;
When the prince said this, Phalabh&uacute;ti, in order to please him,
went that moment, as he was commissioned, to get the earrings made, and
the prince readily went with the king&rsquo;s message, which
Phalabh&uacute;ti told him, alone to the kitchen; when he got there and
told the king&rsquo;s message, the cook S&aacute;hasika, true to his
agreement, immediately killed him with a knife, and made a dish of his
flesh, which the king and queen, after performing their ceremonies,
ate, not knowing the truth;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5281src" href=
"#xd27e5281" name="xd27e5281src">20</a> and after spending that night
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>remorse, the next morning the king saw
Phalabh&uacute;ti arrive with the earrings in his hand.</p>
<p>So, being bewildered, he questioned him about the earrings
immediately; and when Phalabh&uacute;ti had told him his story, the
king fell on the earth, and cried out; &ldquo;Alas my son!&rdquo;
blaming the queen and himself, and when his ministers questioned him,
he told them the whole story, and repeated what Phalabh&uacute;ti had
said every day&mdash;&rdquo;&lsquo;The doer of good will obtain good,
and the doer of evil, evil.&rsquo; Often the harm that one wishes to do
to another, recoils on one&rsquo;s self, as a ball thrown against a
wall rebounding frequently; thus we, wicked ones, desiring to slay a
Br&aacute;hman, have brought about our own son&rsquo;s death, and
devoured his flesh.&rdquo; After the king had said this and informed
his ministers, who stood with their faces fixed on the earth, of the
whole transaction, and after he had anointed that very
Phalabh&uacute;ti as king in his place, he made a distribution of alms
and then, having no son, entered the fire with his wife to purify
himself from guilt, though already consumed by the fire of remorse: and
Phalabh&uacute;ti, having obtained the royal dignity, ruled the earth;
thus good or evil done by a man is made to return upon himself.</p>
<p>Having related the above tale in the presence of the king of Vatsa,
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a again said to that king; &ldquo;If
Brahmadatta therefore were to plot against you, O great king, who,
after conquering him, treated him kindly, he ought to be slain.&rdquo;
When the chief minister had said this to him, the king of Vatsa
approved of it, and rising up went to perform the duties of the day,
and the day following he set out from L&aacute;v&aacute;naka to go to
his own city Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, having accomplished his
objects in effecting the conquest of the regions; in course of time the
lord of earth accompanied by his retinue reached his own city, which
seemed to be dancing with delight, imitating with banners uplifted the
taper arms<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5312src" href="#xd27e5312" name=
"xd27e5312src">21</a> of the dancing girl. So he entered the city,
producing, at every step, in the lotus-garden composed of the eyes of
the women of the city, the effect of the rising of a breeze. And the
king entered his palace, sung by minstrels, praised by bards, and
worshipped by kings. Then the monarch of Vatsa laid his commands on the
kings of every land, who bowed before him, and triumphantly ascended
that throne, the heirloom of his race, which he had found long
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>ago in the deposit of treasure. And the heaven
was filled with the combined high and deep echoes of the sound of the
drums, which accompanied the auspicious ceremonies on that occasion,
like simultaneous shouts of applause uttered by the guardians of the
world, each in his several quarter, being delighted with the prime
minister of the king of Vatsa. Then the monarch, who was free from
avarice, distributed to the Br&aacute;hmans all kinds of wealth
acquired by the conquest of the world, and after great festivities,
satisfied the desires of the company of kings and of his own ministers.
Then in that city filled with the noise of drums resembling the thunder
of the clouds, while the king was raining benefits on the
fields<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5317src" href="#xd27e5317" name=
"xd27e5317src">22</a> according to each man&rsquo;s desert, the people,
expecting great fruit in the form of corn, kept high festival in every
house. Having thus conquered the world, that victorious king devolved
on Ruma&#7751;vat and Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a the burden of his
realm, and lived at ease there with V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. So he, being praised by excellent bards,
seated between those two queens as if they were the goddesses of Fame
and Fortune, enjoyed the rising of the moon white as his own glory, and
continually drank wine as he had swallowed the might of his foes.

<p class="first">Then Udayana, the king of Vatsa, remaining in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, enjoyed the conquered earth which was
under one umbrella; and the happy monarch devolved the care of his
empire upon Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and Ruma&#7751;vat, and
addicted himself to pleasure only in the society of Vasantaka. Himself
playing on the lute, in the company of the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, he was engaged
in a perpetual concert. While the notes of his lyre were married to the
soft sweet song of the queens, the rapid movement of his executing
finger alone indicated the difference of the sounds. And while the roof
of the palace was white with moonlight as with his own glory, he drank
wine in plenteous streams as he had swallowed the pride of his
enemies<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5344src" href="#xd27e5344" name=
"xd27e5344src">3</a>; beautiful women brought him, as he sat retired,
in vessels of gold, wine flaming with rosy glow,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5350src" href="#xd27e5350" name="xd27e5350src">4</a> as it were
the water of his appointment as ruler in the empire of love; he divided
between the two queens the cordial liquor red, delicious, and pellucid,
in which danced the reflection of their faces; as he did his own heart,
impassioned, enraptured and transparent, in which the same image was
found; his eyes were never sated with resting on the faces of those
queens, which had the eyebrows arched, and blushed with the rosy hue of
love, though envy and anger were far from them; the scene of his
banquet, filled with many crystal goblets of wine, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>gleamed like a lake of white lotuses tinged red
with the rising sun. And occasionally, accompanied by huntsmen, clad in
a vest dark green as the <i>pal&aacute;&#347;a</i> tree, he ranged, bow
and arrows in hand, the forest full of wild beasts, which was of the
same colour as himself. He slew with arrows herds of wild boars
besmeared with mud, as the sun disperses with its dense rays the masses
of darkness; when he ran towards them, the antelopes fleeing in terror,
seemed like the sidelong glances of the quarters previously
conquered<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5360src" href="#xd27e5360" name=
"xd27e5360src">5</a> by him.</p>
<p>And when he slew the buffaloes, the ground, red with blood, looked
like a bed of red lotuses, come to thank him humbly for delivering it
from the goring of their horns. When the lions too were transfixed by
his javelins falling in their open mouths, and their lives issued from
them with a suppressed roar, he was delighted. In that wood he employed
dogs in the ravines, and nets in the glades; this was the method of his
pursuit of the chase in which he relied only upon his own resources.
While he was thus engaged in his pleasant enjoyments, one day the
hermit N&aacute;rada came to him as he was in the hall of audience,
diffusing a halo with the radiance of his body, like the sun, the orb
of heaven, descending therefrom out of love for the Solar dynasty. The
king welcomed him, inclining before him again and again, and the sage
stood a moment as if pleased, and said to that king, &ldquo;Listen, O
king, I will tell you a story in few words; you had an ancestor once, a
king of the name of P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u; he like you had two noble
wives; one wife of the mighty prince was named Kunt&iacute; and the
other M&aacute;dr&iacute;. That P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u conquered this
sea-engirdled earth, and was very prosperous, and being addicted to the
vice of hunting he went one day to the forest. There he let fly an
arrow and slew a hermit of the name of Arindama, who was sporting with
his wife in the form of a deer.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5365src"
href="#xd27e5365" name="xd27e5365src">6</a> That hermit abandoned that
deer-form, and with his breath struggling in his throat cursed that
P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u, who in his despair had flung away his bow;
&lsquo;Since I have been slain while sporting at will by thee,
inconsiderate one, thou also shalt die in the embraces of thy
wife.&rsquo; Having been thus cursed, P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u, through
fear of its effect, abandoned the desire of enjoyment, and accompanied
by his wives lived in a tranquil grove of ascetic quietism. While he
was there, one day impelled by that curse, he suddenly approached his
beloved M&aacute;dr&iacute;, and died. So you may rest assured that the
occupation called hunting is a madness of kings, for other kings have
been done to death by it, even as the various deer they have slain. For
how can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>hunting produce benign results, since the genius
of hunting is like a female R&aacute;kshasa, roaring horribly, intent
on raw flesh, defiled with dust, with upstanding hair and lances for
teeth. Therefore give up that useless exertion, the sport of hunting;
wild elephants and their slayers are exposed to the same risk of losing
their lives. And you, who are ordained for prosperity, are dear to me
on account of my friendship with your ancestors, so hear how you are to
have a son who is to be a portion of the god of love. Long ago, when
Rati worshipped &#346;iva with praises in order to effect the
restoration of K&aacute;ma&rsquo;s body, &#346;iva being pleased told
her this secret in few words; &lsquo;This Gaur&iacute;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5375src" href="#xd27e5375" name="xd27e5375src">7</a>
desiring a son, shall descend to earth with a part of herself, and
after propitiating me, shall give birth to an incarnation of
K&aacute;ma.&rsquo; Accordingly, king, the goddess has been born in the
form of this V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, daughter of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena, and she has become your queen. So
she, having propitiated &#346;iva, shall give birth to a son who shall
be a portion of K&aacute;ma, and shall become the emperor of all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; By this speech the &#7770;ishi
N&aacute;rada, whose words command respect, gave back to the king the
earth which he had offered him as a present, and then disappeared. When
he had departed, the king of Vatsa in company with
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, in whom had arisen the desire of obtaining a
son, spent the day in thinking about it.</p>
<p>The next day the chief warder called Nityodita, came to the lord of
Vatsa while he was in the hall of assembly, and said to him; &ldquo;A
certain distressed Br&aacute;hman woman, accompanied by two children,
is standing at the door, O king, desiring to see your Highness.&rdquo;
When the king heard this, he permitted her to enter, and so that
Br&aacute;hman woman entered, thin, pale, and begrimed, distressed by
the tearing of her clothes and wounding of her self-respect, carrying
in her bosom two children looking like Misery and Poverty. After she
had made the proper obeisance, she said to the king, &ldquo;I am a
Br&aacute;hman woman of good caste, reduced to such poverty; as fate
would have it, I gave birth to these two boys at the same time, and I
have no milk for them, O king, without food. Therefore I have come in
my misery and helplessness for protection to the king, who is kind to
all who fly to him for protection; now, my lord the king must determine
what my lot is to be.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he was filled
with pity, and said to the warder, &ldquo;Take this woman and commend
her to the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.&rdquo; Then that woman was
conducted into the presence of the queen by that warder, as it were by
her own good actions marching in front of her. The queen, when she
heard from that warder that the Br&aacute;hman woman who had come had
been sent by the king, felt all the more confidence in her. And when
she saw that the woman, though poor, had two children, she thought,
&ldquo;This is exceedingly unfair dealing on the part <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>of
the Creator! Alas! he grudges a son to me who am rich, and shews
affection to one who is poor! I have not yet one son, but this woman
has these twins.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the queen, who was herself
desiring a bath, gave orders to her servants to provide the
Br&aacute;hman woman with a bath and other restoratives. After she had
been provided with a bath, and had had clothes given her, and had been
supplied by them with agreeable food, that Br&aacute;hman woman was
refreshed like the heated earth bedewed with rain. And as soon as she
had been refreshed, the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, in order to
test her by conversation, artfully said to her, &ldquo;O Br&aacute;hman
lady, tell us some tale,&rdquo; when she heard that, she agreed and
began to tell this story.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Devadatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old time there was a certain petty monarch of the
name of Jayadatta and there was born to him a son, named Devadatta. And
that wise king wishing to marry his son who was grown up, thus
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;The prosperity of kings is very unstable, being
like a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> to be enjoyed by force, but the prosperity
of merchants is like a woman of good family, it is steady and does not
fly to another man. Therefore I will take a wife to my son from a
merchant&rsquo;s family, in order that misfortune may not overtake his
throne, though it is surrounded with many relations.&rdquo; Having
formed this resolve, that king sought for his son the daughter of a
merchant in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra named Vasudatta. Vasudatta, for
his part, eager for such a distinguished alliance, gave that daughter
of his to the prince, though he dwelt in a remote foreign land.</p>
<p>And he loaded his son-in-law with wealth to such an extent that he
no longer felt much respect for his father&rsquo;s magnificence. Then
king Jayadatta dwelt happily with that son of his who had obtained the
daughter of that rich merchant. Now one day the merchant Vasudatta
came, full of desire to see his daughter, to the palace of his
connexion by marriage, and took away his daughter to his own home.
Shortly after the king Jayadatta suddenly went to heaven, and that
kingdom was seized by his relations who rose in rebellion; through fear
of them his son Devadatta was secretly taken away by his mother during
the night to another country. Then that mother distressed in soul said
to the prince&mdash;&ldquo;Our feudal lord is the emperor who rules the
eastern region, repair to him, my son, he will procure you the
kingdom.&rdquo; When his mother said this to him, the prince answered
her; &ldquo;Who will respect me if I go there without
attendants?&rdquo; When she heard that, his mother went on to say,
&ldquo;Go to the house of your father-in-law, and get money there and
so procure followers, and then repair to the emperor.&rdquo; Being
urged in these words by his mother, the prince, though full of shame,
slowly plodded on and reached his father-in-law&rsquo;s house in the
evening, but he could not bear to enter at such an unseasonable hour,
for he was afraid of shedding tears, being bereaved of his father,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>and having lost his worldly splendour, besides
shame withheld him. So he remained in the verandah of an alms house
near, and at night he suddenly beheld a woman descending with a rope
from his father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and immediately he recognized her
as his wife, for she was so resplendent with jewels that she looked
like a meteor fallen from the clouds, and he was much grieved thereat,
but she, though she saw him, did not recognise him, as he was emaciated
and begrimed, and asked him who he was; when he heard that, he
answered, &ldquo;I am a traveller;&rdquo; then the merchant&rsquo;s
daughter entered the alms-house, and the prince followed her secretly
to watch her. There she advanced towards a certain man, and he towards
her, and asking her why she had come so late, he bestowed several kicks
on her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5399src" href="#xd27e5399" name=
"xd27e5399src">8</a> Then the passion of the wicked woman was doubled,
and she appeased him and remained with him on the most affectionate
terms. When he saw that, the discreet prince reflected; &ldquo;This is
not the time for me to shew anger, for I have other affairs in hand,
and how could I employ against these two contemptible creatures, this
wife of mine and the man who has done me this wrong, this sword which
is to be used against my foes? Or what quarrel have I with this
adulteress, for this is the work of malignant destiny, that showers
calamities upon me, shewing skill in the game of testing my firmness?
It is my marriage with a woman below me in rank that is in fault, not
the woman herself; how can a female crow leave the male crow to take
pleasure in a cuckoo?&rdquo; Thus reflecting, he allowed that wife of
his to remain in the society of her paramour; for in the minds of
heroes possessed with an ardent desire of victory, of what importance
is woman, valueless as a straw? But at the moment when his wife
ardently embraced her paramour, there fell from her ear an ornament
thickly studded with valuable jewels. And she did not observe this, but
at the end of her interview taking leave of her paramour, returned
hurriedly to her house as she came. And that unlawful lover also
departed somewhere or other. Then the prince saw that jewelled ornament
and took it up; it flashed with many jewel-gleams, dispelling the
gathering darkness of despondency, and seemed like a hand-lamp obtained
by him to assist him in searching for his lost prosperity. The prince
immediately perceived that it was very valuable, and went off, having
obtained all he required, to K&aacute;nyakubja; there be pledged that
ornament for a hundred thousand gold pieces, and after buying horses
and elephants went into the presence of the emperor. And with the
troops, which he gave him, he marched and slew his enemies in fight,
and recovered his father&rsquo;s kingdom, and his mother applauded his
success. Then he redeemed from pawn that ornament, and sent it to his
father-in-law to reveal that unsuspected secret; his father-in-law,
when he saw that ear-ring of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=
"#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>his daughter&rsquo;s, which had
come to him in such a way, was confounded and shewed it to her: she
looked upon it, lost long ago like her own virtue, and when she heard
that it had been sent by her husband, she was distracted and called to
mind the whole circumstance: &ldquo;This is the very ornament which I
let fall in the alms-house the night I saw that unknown traveller
standing there; so that must undoubtedly have been my husband come to
test my virtue, but I did not recognize him, and he picked up this
ornament.&rdquo; While the merchant&rsquo;s daughter was going through
this train of reflection, her heart, afflicted by the misfortune of her
unchastity having been discovered, in its agony, broke. Then her father
artfully questioned a maid of hers who knew all her secrets, and found
out the truth, and so ceased to mourn for his daughter; as for the
prince, after he recovered the kingdom, he obtained as wife the
daughter of the emperor won by his virtues, and enjoyed the highest
prosperity.</p>
<p>So you see that the hearts of women are hard as adamant in daring
sin, but are soft as a flower when the tremor of fear falls upon them.
But there are some few women born in good families, that, having hearts
virtuous<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5411src" href="#xd27e5411" name=
"xd27e5411src">9</a> and of transparent purity, become like pearls the
ornaments of the earth. And the fortune of kings is ever bounding away
like a doe, but the wise know how to bind it by the tether of firmness,
as you see in my story; therefore those who desire good fortune must
not abandon their virtue even in calamity, and of this principle my
present circumstances are an illustration, for I preserved my
character, O queen, even in this calamity, and that has borne me fruit
in the shape of the good fortune of beholding you.</p>
<p>Having heard this tale from the mouth of that Br&aacute;hman woman,
the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, feeling respect for her,
immediately thought,&mdash;&ldquo;Surely this Br&aacute;hman woman must
be of good family, for the indirect way in which she alluded to her own
virtue and her boldness in speech prove that she is of gentle birth,
and this is the reason why she shewed such tact in entering the
king&rsquo;s court of justice,&rdquo;&mdash;having gone through these
reflections, the queen again said to the Br&aacute;hman woman:
&ldquo;Whose wife are you, or what is the history of your life? Tell
me.&rdquo; When she heard that, the Br&aacute;hman woman again began to
speak&mdash;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Pingalik&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Queen, there was a certain Br&aacute;hman in the
country or M&aacute;lava, named Agnidatta, the home of Fortune and of
Learning, who willingly impoverished himself to help suppliants, and in
course of time there were born to him two sons like himself; the eldest
was called &#346;ankaradatta and the other &#346;&aacute;ntikara; of
these two, oh glorious one, &#346;&aacute;ntikara suddenly left his
father&rsquo;s house in quest of learning, while he was still a boy,
and went, I know not whither, and the other son his elder brother
married me, who am <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"
name="pb171">171</a>]</span>the daughter of Yajnadatta who collected
wealth for the sake of sacrifice only. In course of time the father of
my husband, who was named Agnidatta, being old, went to the next world
and his wife followed him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5426src" href=
"#xd27e5426" name="xd27e5426src">10</a> and my husband left me, when I
was pregnant, to go to holy places, and through sorrow for his loss
abandoned the body in fire purified by the goddess Sarasvat&iacute;;
and when that fact was told us by those who accompanied him in his
pilgrimage, I was not permitted to follow him by my relations, as I was
pregnant. Then, while my grief was fresh, brigands suddenly swooped
down on us and plundered my house and all the royal grant; immediately
I fled with three Br&aacute;hman women from that place, for fear that I
might be outraged, taking with me very few garments. And, as the whole
kingdom was ravaged, I went to a distant land accompanied by them, and
remained there a month only supporting myself by menial drudgery. And
then hearing from people that the king of Vatsa was the refuge of the
helpless, I came here with the three Br&aacute;hman women, with no
other travelling provision than my virtue; and as soon as I arrived I
gave birth at the same time to two boys. Thus, though I have the
friendly assistance of these three Br&aacute;hman women, I have
suffered bereavement, banishment, poverty, and now comes this birth of
twins; Alas! Providence has opened to me the door of calamity.
Accordingly, reflecting that I had no other means of maintaining these
children, I laid aside shame, the ornament of women, and entering into
the king&rsquo;s court I made a petition to him. Who is able to endure
the sight of the misery of youthful offspring? And in consequence of
his order, I have come into your august presence, and my calamities
have turned back, as if ordered away from your door. This is my
history: as for my name, it is Pingalik&aacute;, because from my
childhood my eyes have been reddened by the smoke of the
burnt-offerings. And that brother-in-law of mine &#346;&aacute;ntikara
dwells in a foreign land, but in what land he is now living, I have not
as yet discovered.</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman woman had told her history in these words,
the queen came to the conclusion that she was a lady of high birth, and
after reflecting, said this to her with an affectionate manner:
&ldquo;There is dwelling here a foreign Br&aacute;hman of the name of
&#346;&aacute;ntikara, and he is our domestic chaplain; I am certain he
will turn out to be your brother-in-law.&rdquo; After saying this to
the eager Br&aacute;hman lady, the queen allowed that night to pass,
and the next morning sent for &#346;&aacute;ntikara and asked him about
his descent. And when he had told her his descent, she, ascertaining
that the two accounts tallied completely, shewed him that
Br&aacute;hman lady, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Here is your
brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; And when they recognised one another, and
he had heard of the death of his relations, he took the Br&aacute;hman
lady the wife of his brother to his own house. There he mourned
exceedingly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>as was natural, for the death of his parents and
his brother, and comforted the lady who was accompanied by her two
children; and the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; settled that the
Br&aacute;hman lady&rsquo;s two young sons should be the domestic
chaplains of her future son, and the queen also gave the eldest the
name of &#346;&aacute;ntisoma, and the next of Vai&#347;v&aacute;nara,
and she bestowed on them much wealth. The people of this world are like
a blind man, being led to the place of recompense by their own actions,
going before them,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5435src" href=
"#xd27e5435" name="xd27e5435src">11</a> and their courage is merely an
instrument. Then those two children, and their mother and
&#346;&aacute;ntikara remained united there, having obtained
wealth.</p>
<p>Then once upon a time, as days went on, the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; beheld from her palace a certain woman of the
caste of potters coming with five sons, bringing plates, and she said
to the Br&aacute;hman lady Pingalik&aacute;, who was at her side;
&ldquo;Observe, my friend: this woman has five sons, and I have not
even one as yet, to such an extent is such a one the possessor of
merit, while such a one as myself is not.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5442src" href="#xd27e5442" name="xd27e5442src">12</a></p>
<p>Then Pingalik&aacute; said, &ldquo;Queen, these numerous sons are
people who have committed many sins in a previous existence, and are
born to poor people in order that they may suffer for them, but the son
that shall be born to such a one as you, must have been in a former
life a very virtuous person. Therefore do not be impatient, you will
soon obtain a son such as you deserve.&rdquo; Though Pingalik&aacute;
said this to her, V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, being eager for the birth
of a son, remained with her mind overpowered by anxiety about it. At
that moment the king of Vatsa came and perceiving what was in her heart
said&mdash;&ldquo;Queen, N&aacute;rada said that you should obtain a
son by propitiating &#346;iva, therefore we must continually propitiate
&#346;iva, that granter of boons<span class="corr" id="xd27e5453"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; Upon that, the queen quickly
determined upon performing a vow, and when she had taken a vow, the
king and his ministers and the whole kingdom also took a vow to
propitiate &#346;iva; and after the royal couple had fasted for three
nights, that Lord was so pleased that he himself appeared to them and
commanded them in a dream,&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up; from you shall spring
a son who shall be a portion of the god of love, and owing to my favour
shall be king of all the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; When the god, whose
crest is the moon, had said this and disappeared, that couple woke up,
and immediately felt unfeigned joy at having obtained their boon, and
considered that they had gained their object. And in the morning the
king and queen rose up, and after delighting the subjects with the
taste of the nectarous story of their dream, kept high festival with
their relations and servants, and broke in this manner the fast of
their vow. After some days had past, a certain man with matted locks
came and gave the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; a fruit in her dream.
Then the king of Vatsa rejoiced with the queen, who informed him of
that clear dream, and he was congratulated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>by
his ministers, and supposing that the god of the moon-crest had given
her a son under the form of a fruit, he considered the fulfilment of
his wish to be not far off.</p>

<p class="first">Then, in a short time, V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
became pregnant with a child, glorious inasmuch as it was an
incarnation of the god of Love, and it was a feast to the eyes of the
king of Vatsa. She shone with a face, the eyes of which rolled, and
which was of palish hue, as if with the moon come to visit her out of
affection for the god of Love conceived in her. When she was sitting
down, the two images of her form, reflected in the sides of the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5463" title=

unborn son. When she lay down on a comfortable couch in the middle of
the palace, which gleamed with pavement composed of translucent,
flashing, lustrous jewels, she appeared as if she were being
propitiated by the waters, that had come there trembling, through fear
of being conquered by her future son, with heaps of jewels on every
side. Her image reflected from the gems in the middle of the chariot,
appeared like the Fortune of the Vidy&aacute;haras coming in the heaven
to offer her adoration. And she felt a longing for stories of great
magicians provided with incantations by means of spells, introduced
appropriately in conversation. Vidy&aacute;dhara ladies, beginning
melodious songs, waited upon her when in her dream she rose high up in
the sky, and when she woke up, she desired to enjoy in reality the
amusement of sporting in the air, which would give the pleasure of
looking down upon the earth. And Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a gratified
that longing of the queen&rsquo;s by employing spells, machines,
juggling, and such like contrivances. So she roamed through the air by
means of those various contrivances, which furnished a wonderful
spectacle to the upturned eyes of the citizens&rsquo; wives. But once
on a time, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=

heart a desire to hear the glorious tales of the Vidy&aacute;dharas;

her this tale while all were listening.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a great mountain named Himavat, the father of
the mother of the world,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5490src" href=
"#xd27e5490" name="xd27e5490src">4</a> who is not only the chief of
hills, but the spiritual preceptor of &#346;iva, and on that great
mountain, the home of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, dwelt the lord of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, the king J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu. And in his house
there was a wishing-tree<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5498src" href=
"#xd27e5498" name="xd27e5498src">5</a>, which had come down to him from
his ancestors, called by a name which expressed its nature, The Giver
of Desires. And one day the king J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu approached
that wishing-tree in his garden, which was of divine nature, and
supplicated it; &ldquo;We always obtain from you all <span class="corr"
id="xd27e5501" title="Source: you">we</span> desire, therefore give me,
O god, who am now childless, a virtuous son.&rdquo; Then the
wishing-tree said,&mdash;&ldquo;King, there shall be born to thee a son
who shall remember his past birth, who shall be a hero in giving, and
kind to all creatures.&rdquo; When he heard that, the king was
delighted, and bowed before that tree, and then he went and delighted
his queen with the news: accordingly in a short time a son was born to
him, and his father called the son J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana.
Then that J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who was of great goodness,
grew up step by step with the growth of his innate compassion for all
creatures. And in course of time, when he was made Crown-Prince, he
being full of compassion for the world said in secret to his father,
who was pleased by his attentions&mdash;&ldquo;I know, O father, that
in this world all things perish in an instant, but the pure glory of
the great alone endures till the end of a Kalpa.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5504src" href="#xd27e5504" name="xd27e5504src">6</a> If it is
acquired by benefiting others, what other wealth can be, like it,
valued by high-minded men more than life. And as for prosperity, if it
be not used to benefit others, it is like lightning which for a moment
pains the eye, and flickering disappears somewhere or other. So, if
this wishing-tree, which we possess, and which grants all desires, is
employed for the benefit of others, we shall have reaped from it all
the fruit it can give. So let me take such steps as that by its riches
the whole multitude of men in need may be rescued from poverty.&rdquo;
This petition J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana made to his father, and
having obtained his permission, he went and said to that wishing-tree,
&ldquo;O god, thou always givest us the desired fruit, therefore fulfil
to-day this one wish of ours. O my friend, relieve this whole world
from its poverty, success to thee, thou art bestowed on the world that
desires wealth!&rdquo; The wishing-tree being addressed in this style
by that self-denying one, showered much gold on the earth, and all the
people rejoiced; what other compassionate incarnation of a Bodhisattva
except the glorious J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana would be able to
dispose even of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175"
name="pb175">175</a>]</span>a wishing-tree in favour of the needy? For
this reason every region of the earth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5510src" href="#xd27e5510" name="xd27e5510src">7</a> became
devoted to J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, and his stainless fame
was spread on high.</p>
<p>Then the relations of J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu, seeing that his
throne was firmly established by the glory of his son, were envious,
and became hostile to him. And they thought it would be easy to conquer
that place, which possessed the excellent wishing-tree that was
employed for bestowing gifts, on account of its not being strong: then
they assembled and determined on war, and thereupon the self-denying
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said to his father,&mdash;&ldquo;As
this body of ours is like a bubble in the water, for the sake of what
do we desire prosperity, which flickers like a candle exposed to the
wind? And what wise man desires to attain prosperity by the slaughter
of others? Accordingly, my father, I ought not to fight with my
relations. But I must leave my kingdom and go to some forest or other;
let these miserable wretches be, let us not slay the members of our own
family.&rdquo; When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana had said this,
his father J&iacute;m&uacute;taketu formed a resolution and said to
him; &ldquo;I too must go, my son, for what desire for rule can I, who
am old, have, when you, though young, out of compassion abandon your
realm as if it were so much grass?&rdquo; In these words his father
expressed his acquiescence in the project of
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who then, with his father and his
father&rsquo;s wife, went to the Malaya mountain. There he remained in
a hermitage, the dwelling of the Siddhas, where the brooks were hidden
by the sandal-wood trees, and devoted himself to taking care of his
father. There he struck up a friendship with the self-denying son of
Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu, the chief prince of the Siddhas, whose name was
Mitr&aacute;vasu. And once on a time the all-knowing
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana beheld in a lonely place
Mitr&aacute;vasu&rsquo;s maiden sister, who had been his beloved in a
former birth. And the mutual gaze of those two young people was like
the catching in a frail net of the deer of the mind.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5515src" href="#xd27e5515" name="xd27e5515src">8</a></p>
<p>Then one day Mitr&aacute;vasu came up suddenly to
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, who deserved the respect of the
three worlds, with a pleased expression, and said to him, &ldquo;I have
a younger sister, the maiden called Malayavat&iacute;; I give her to
you, do not refuse to gratify my wish.&rdquo; When
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana heard that, he said to him, &ldquo;O
prince, she was my wife in a former birth, and in that life you became
my friend, and were like a second heart to me. I am one who remembers
the former state of existence, I recollect all that happened in my
previous birth.&rdquo; When he said this, Mitr&aacute;vasu said to him,
&ldquo;then tell me this story of your former birth, for I feel
curiosity about it.&rdquo; When he heard this from Mitr&aacute;vasu,
the benevolent J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana told him the tale of
his former birth as follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=

<h3 class="main">Story of J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s
adventures in a former birth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus it is; formerly I was a sky-roaming
Vidy&aacute;dhara, and once on a time I was passing over a peak of the
Him&aacute;laya. And then &#346;iva, who was below, sporting with
Gaur&iacute;, being angry at my passing above him, cursed me, saying,
&ldquo;Descend into a mortal womb, and after obtaining a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; for your wife, and appointing your son in your
place, you shall remember your former birth, and again be born as a
Vidy&aacute;dhara.&rdquo; Having pronounced when this curse should end,
&#346;iva ceased and disappeared; and soon after I was born upon earth
in a family of merchants. And I grew up as the son of a rich merchant
in a city named Vallabh&iacute;, and my name was Vasudatta. And in
course of time, when I became a young man, I had a retinue given me by
my father, and went by his orders to another land to traffic. As I was
going along, robbers fell upon me in a forest, and after taking all my
property, led me in chains to a temple of Durg&aacute; in their
village, terrible with a long waving banner of red silk like the tongue
of Death eager to devour the lives of animals. There they brought me
into the presence of their chief named Pulindaka, who was engaged in
worshipping the goddess, in order that I might serve as a victim. He,
though he was a &#346;avara,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5530src" href=
"#xd27e5530" name="xd27e5530src">9</a> the moment he saw me, felt his
heart melt with pity for me; an apparently causeless affectionate
movement of the heart is a sign of friendship in a former birth. Then
that &#346;avara king, having saved me from slaughter, was about to
complete the rite by the sacrifice of himself, when a heavenly voice
said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Do not act thus, I am pleased with thee, crave
a boon of me,&rdquo;&mdash;thereupon he was delighted, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;O goddess, thou art pleased; what other blessing can
I need, nevertheless I ask so much&mdash;may I have friendship with
this merchant&rsquo;s son in another birth also.&rdquo; The voice
said&mdash;&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and then ceased, and then that
&#346;avara gave me much wealth, and sent me back to my own home. And
then, as I had returned from foreign travel and from the jaws of death,
my father, when he heard the whole occurrence, made a great feast in my
honour. And in course of time I saw there that very same &#346;avara
chief, whom the king had ordered to be brought before him as a prisoner
for plundering a caravan. I told my father of it immediately, and
making a petition to the king, I saved him from capital punishment by
the payment of a hundred thousand gold-pieces. And having in this way
repaid the benefit, which he conferred upon me by saving my life, I
brought him to my house, and entertained him honourably for a long time
with all loving attention. And then, after this hospitable
entertainment, I dismissed him, and he went to his own village fixing
upon me a heart tender with affection. Then, while he thought about a
present for me that might be worthy of my return for his previous
kindness, he came to the conclusion that the pearls and musk
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>and treasures of that kind, which were at his
disposal, were not valuable enough. Thereupon he took his bow and went
off to the Him&aacute;laya to shoot elephants, in order to obtain a
surpassingly splendid necklace<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5535src"
href="#xd27e5535" name="xd27e5535src">10</a> for me. And while he was
roaming about there, he reached a great lake with a temple upon its
shore, being welcomed by its lotuses, which were as devoted to their
friend<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5540src" href="#xd27e5540" name=
"xd27e5540src">11</a> as he was to me. And suspecting that the wild
elephants would come there to drink water, he remained in concealment
with his bow, in order to kill them. In the meanwhile he saw a young
lady of wonderful beauty come riding upon a lion to worship &#346;iva,
whose temple stood on the shore of the lake; looking like a second
daughter of the king of the snowy mountains, devoted to the service of
&#346;iva while in her girlhood. And the &#346;avara, when he saw her,
being overpowered with wonder, reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Who can this be?
If she is a mortal woman, why does she ride upon a lion? On the other
hand, if she is divine, how can she be seen by such as me? So she must
certainly be the incarnate development of the merits of my eyes in a
former birth. If I could only marry my friend to her, then I should
have bestowed upon him a new and wonderful recompense. So I had better
first approach her to question her.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, my friend
the &#346;avara advanced to meet her. In the meanwhile she dismounted
from the lion, that lay down in the shade, and advancing began to pick
the lotuses of the lake. And seeing the &#346;avara, who was a
stranger, coming towards her and bowing, out of a hospitable feeling
she gratified him with a welcome. And she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Who
are you, and why have you come to this inaccessible land?&rdquo;
Thereupon the &#346;avara answered her, &ldquo;I am a prince of the
&#346;avaras, who regard the feet of Bhav&aacute;n&iacute; as my only
refuge, and I am come to this wood to get pearls from the heads of
elephants. But when I beheld you just now, O goddess, I called to mind
my own friend that saved my life, the son of a merchant prince, the
auspicious Vasudatta. For he, O fair one, is, like you, matchless for
beauty and youth, a very fount of nectar to the eyes of this world.
Happy is that maiden in the world, whose braceleted hand is taken in
this life by that treasure-house of friendship, generosity, compassion,
and patience. And if this beautiful form of yours is not linked to such
a man, then I cannot help grieving that K&aacute;ma bears the bow in
vain.&rdquo; By these words of the king of the hunters the mind of the
maiden was suddenly carried away, as if by the syllables of the god of
Love&rsquo;s bewildering spell. And prompted by love, she said to that
&#346;avara, &ldquo;Where is that friend of yours? Bring him here and
shew him to me.&rdquo; When he heard that, he said&mdash;&ldquo;I will
do so,&rdquo; and that moment the &#346;avara took leave of her and set
out on his journey in high spirits, considering his object attained.
And after he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>had reached his village, he took with him pearls
and musk, a weight sufficient for hundreds of heavily-laden porters,
and came to our house. There he was honoured by all the inmates, and
entering it, he offered to my father that present, which was worth much
gold. And after that day and that night had been spent in feasting, he
related to me in private the story of his interview with the maiden
from the very commencement. And he said to me, who was all excitement,
&ldquo;Come, let us go there,&rdquo; and so the &#346;avara carried me
off at night just as he pleased. And in the morning my father found
that I had gone off somewhere with the &#346;avara prince, but feeling
perfect confidence in his affection, he remained master of his
feelings. But I was conducted in course of time by that &#346;avara,
who travelled fast, to the Him&aacute;laya, and he tended me carefully
throughout the journey.</p>
<p>And one evening we reached that lake, and bathed, and we remained
that one night in the wood eating sweet fruits. That mountain wood, in
which the creepers strewed the ground with flowers, and which was
charming with the hum of bees, full of balmy gales, and with beautiful
gleaming herbs for lamps, was like the chamber of Rati to repose in
during the night for us two, who drank the water of the lake. Then, the
next day that maiden came there, and at every step my mind, full of
strange longings, flew to meet her, and her arrival was heralded by
this my right eye, throbbing as if through eagerness to behold
her.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5549src" href="#xd27e5549" name=
"xd27e5549src">12</a> And that maid with lovely eyebrows was beheld by
me, on the back of a knotty-maned lion, like a digit of the moon
resting in the lap of an autumn cloud; and I cannot describe how my
heart felt at that time while I gazed on her, being full of tumultuous
emotions of astonishment, longing, and fear; then that maiden
dismounted from the lion, and gathered flowers, and after bathing in
the lake, worshipped &#346;iva who dwelt in the temple on its
banks.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5552src" href="#xd27e5552" name=
"xd27e5552src">13</a> And when the worship was ended, that &#346;avara,
my friend, advanced towards her and announcing himself, bowed, and said
to her who received him courteously; &ldquo;Goddess, I have brought
that friend of mine as a suitable bridegroom for you: if you think
proper, I will shew him to you this moment.&rdquo; When she heard that,
she said, &ldquo;Shew him,&rdquo; and that &#346;avara came and took me
near her and shewed me to her. She looked at me askance with an eye
that shed love, and being overcome by Cupid&rsquo;s taking possession
of her soul, said to that chieftain of the &#346;avaras; &ldquo;This
friend of yours is not a man, surely he is some god come here to
deceive me to-day: how could a mortal have such a handsome
shape?&rdquo; When I heard that, I said myself to remove all doubt from
her mind: &ldquo;Fair one, I am in very truth a mortal, what is the use
of employing fraud against one so honest as yourself, lady? For I am
the son of a merchant named Mah&aacute;dhana that dwells in
Vallabh&iacute;, and I was gained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>by my father by the blessing
of &#346;iva. For he, when performing austerities to please the god of
the moony crest, in order that he might obtain a son, was thus
commanded by the god in a dream being pleased with him; &lsquo;Rise up,
there shall spring from thee a great-hearted son, and this is a great
secret, what is the use of setting it forth at length?&rsquo; After
hearing this, he woke up, and in course of time I was born to him as a
son, and I am known by the name of Vasudatta. And long ago, when I went
to a foreign land, I obtained this &#346;avara chieftain for a chosen
friend, who shewed himself a true helper in misfortune. This is a brief
statement of the truth about me.&rdquo; When I had said this I ceased;
and that maiden, with her face cast down from modesty,
said&mdash;&ldquo;It is so; to-day, I know, &#346;iva being propitiated
deigned to tell me in a dream, after I had worshipped
him,&mdash;&lsquo;To-morrow morning thou shalt obtain a
husband:&rsquo;&mdash;so you are my husband, and this friend of yours
is my brother.&rdquo; When she had delighted me by this nectar-like
speech, she ceased; and after I had deliberated with her, I determined
to go to my own house with my friend, in order that the marriage might
be solemnized in due form. Then that fair one summoned by a sign of her
own that lion, on which she rode, and said to me, &ldquo;Mount it, my
husband,&rdquo; then I, by the advice of my friend, mounted the lion,
and taking that beloved one in my arms, I set out thence for my home,
having obtained all my objects, riding on the lion with my beloved,
guided by that friend. And living on the flesh of the deer that he
killed with his arrows, we all reached in course of time the city of
Vallabh&iacute;. Then the people, seeing me coming along with my
beloved, riding on a lion, being astonished, ran and told that fact
quickly to my father. He too came to meet me in his joy, and when he
saw me dismount from the lion and fall at his feet, he welcomed me with
astonishment.</p>
<p>And when he saw that incomparable beauty adore his feet, and
perceived that she was a fit wife for me, he could not contain himself
for joy. So he entered the house, and after asking us about the
circumstances, he made a great feast, praising the friendship of the
&#346;avara chieftain. And the next day, by the appointment of the
astrologers, I married that excellent maiden, and all my friends and
relations assembled to witness our wedding. And that lion, on which my
wife had ridden, having witnessed the marriage, suddenly before the
eyes of all, assumed the form of a man. Then all the by-standers were
bewildered thinking&mdash;&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; But he,
assuming heavenly garments and ornaments, thus addressed me: &ldquo;I
am a Vidy&aacute;dhara named Chitr&aacute;ngada, and this maiden is my
daughter Manovat&iacute; by name, dearer to me than life. I used to
wander continually through the forest with her in my arms, and one day
I reached the Ganges, on the banks of which are many ascetic groves.
And as I was going along in the middle of the river, for fear of
disturbing the ascetics, my garland by accident fell into its waters.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>Then the hermit N&aacute;rada, who was under the
water, suddenly rose up, and angry because the garland had fallen upon
his back, cursed me in the following words: &lsquo;On account of this
insolence, depart, wicked one, thou shalt become a lion, and repairing
to the Him&aacute;laya, shalt carry this daughter upon thy back. And
when thy daughter shall be taken in marriage by a mortal, then after
witnessing the ceremony, thou shalt be freed from this curse.&rsquo;
After being cursed in these words by the hermit, I became a lion, and
dwelt on the Him&aacute;laya carrying about this daughter of mine, who
is devoted to the worship of &#346;iva. And you know well the sequel of
the story, how by the exertions of the &#346;avara chieftain this
highly auspicious event has been brought about. So I shall now depart;
good luck to you all! I have now reached the termination of that
curse.&rdquo; Having said this, that Vidy&aacute;dhara immediately flew
up into the sky. Then my father, overwhelmed with astonishment at the
marvel, delighted at the eligible connection, and finding that his
friends and relations were overjoyed, made a great feast. And there was
not a single person who did not say with astonishment, reflecting again
and again on that noble behaviour of the &#346;avara
chieftain&mdash;&ldquo;Who can imagine the actions of sincere friends,
who are not even satisfied when they have bestowed on their sworn
brothers the gift of life?&rdquo; The king of the land too, hearing of
that occurrence, was exceedingly pleased with the affection which the
&#346;avara prince had shown me, and finding he was pleased, my father
gave him a present of jewels, and so induced him immediately to bestow
on the &#346;avara a vast forest territory. Then I remained there in
happiness, considering myself to have attained all that heart could
wish, in having Manovat&iacute; for a wife, and the &#346;avara prince
for a friend. And that &#346;avara chieftain generally lived in my
house, finding that he took less pleasure in dwelling in his own
country than he formerly did. And the time of us two friends, of him
and me, was spent in continually conferring benefits upon one another
without our ever being satisfied. And not long after I had a son born
to me by Manovat&iacute;, who seemed like the heart-joy of the whole
family in external visible form; and being called Hira&#7751;yadatta he
gradually grew up, and after having been duly instructed, he was
married. Then my father having witnessed that, and considering that the
object of his life had been accomplished, being old, went to the Ganges
with his wife to leave the body. Then I was afflicted by my
father&rsquo;s death, but having been at last persuaded by my relations
to control my feelings, I consented to uphold the burden of the family.
And at that time on the one hand the sight of the beautiful face of
Manovat&iacute;, and on the other the society of the &#346;avara prince
delighted me. Accordingly those days of mine passed, joyous from the
goodness of my son, charming from the excellence of my wife, happy from
the society of my friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, in course of time, I became well-stricken in years, and old
age seized me by the chin, as it were out of love giving me this
wholesome reproach&mdash;&ldquo;Why are you remaining in the house so
long as this, my son?&rdquo; Then disgust with the world was suddenly
produced in my breast, and longing for the forest I appointed my son in
my stead. And with my wife I went to the mountain of K&aacute;linjara,
together with the king of the &#346;avaras, who abandoned his kingdom
out of love to me. And when I arrived there, I at once remembered that
I had been a Vidy&aacute;dhara in a former state of existence, and that
the curse I had received from &#346;iva had come to an end. And I
immediately told my wife Manovat&iacute; of that, and my friend the
king of the &#346;avaras, as I was desirous of leaving this mortal
body. I said&mdash;&ldquo;May I have this wife and this friend in a
future birth, and may I remember this birth,&rdquo; and then I
meditated on &#346;iva in my heart, and flung myself from that hill
side, and so suddenly quitted the body together with that wife and
friend. And so I have been now born, as you see, in this
Vidy&aacute;dhara family, under the name of
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, with a power of recollecting my
former existence. And you, that prince of the &#346;avaras, have been
also born again by the favour of &#346;iva, as Mitr&aacute;vasu the son
of Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu the king of the Siddhas. And, my friend, that
Vidy&aacute;dhara lady, my wife Manovat&iacute;, has been again born as
your sister Malayavat&iacute; by name. So your sister is my former
wife, and you were my friend in a former state of existence, therefore
it is quite proper that I should marry her. But first go and tell this
to my parents, for if the matter is referred to them, your desire will
be successfully accomplished.</p>
<p>When Mitr&aacute;vasu heard this from
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, he was pleased, and he went and told
all that to the parents of J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana. And when
they received his proposal gladly, he was pleased, and went and told
that same matter to his own parents. And they were delighted at the
accomplishment of their desire, and so the prince quickly prepared for
the marriage of his sister. Then J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana,
honoured by the king of the Siddhas, received according to usage the
hand of Malayavat&iacute;. And there was a great festival, in which the
heavenly minstrels bustled about, the dense crowd of the Siddhas
assembled, and which was enlivened by bounding Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was married, and remained on that
Malaya mountain with his wife in very great prosperity. And once on a
time he went with his brother-in-law Mitr&aacute;vasu to behold the
woods on the shore of the sea. And there he saw a young man come in an
agitated state, sending away his mother, who kept exclaiming
&ldquo;Alas! my son!&rdquo; And another man, who seemed to be a
soldier, following him, conducted him to a broad and high slab of rock
and left him there. J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said to him:
&ldquo;Who are you? What are you about to do, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>why
does your mother weep for you?&rdquo; Then the man told him his
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago Kadr&uacute; and Vinat&aacute;, the two wives of
Ka&#347;yapa, had a dispute in the course of a conversation which they
were carrying on. The former said that the Sun&rsquo;s horses were
black, the latter that they were white, and they made an agreement that
the one that was wrong should become a slave to the other.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5570src" href="#xd27e5570" name=
"xd27e5570src">14</a> Then Kadr&uacute;, bent on winning, actually
induced her sons, the snakes, to defile the horses of the Sun by
spitting venom over them; and shewing them to Vinat&aacute; in that
condition, she conquered her by a trick and made her her slave:
terrible is the spite of women against each other! When Garu&#7693;a
the son of Vinat&aacute; heard of that, he came and tried to induce
Kadr&uacute; by fair means to release Vinat&aacute; from her slavery;
then the snakes, the sons of Kadr&uacute;, reflecting, said this to
him; &lsquo;O Garu&#7693;a, the gods have began to churn the sea of
milk, bring the nectar thence and give it to us as a substitute, and
then take your mother away with you, for you are the chief of
heroes.&rsquo; When Garu&#7693;a heard that, he went to the sea of
milk, and displayed his great might in order to obtain the nectar. Then
the god Vish&#7751;u pleased with his might deigned to say to him,
&lsquo;I am pleased with thee, choose some boon.&rsquo; Then
Garu&#7693;a, angry because his mother was made a slave, asked as a
boon from Vish&#7751;u&mdash;&lsquo;May the snakes become my
food.&rsquo; Vish&#7751;u consented, and when Garu&#7693;a had obtained
the nectar by his own valour, he was thus addressed by Indra who had
heard the whole story: &lsquo;King of birds, you must take steps to
prevent the foolish snakes from consuming the nectar, and to enable me
to take it away from them again.&rsquo; When Garu&#7693;a heard that,
he agreed to do it, and elated by the boon of Vish&#7751;u, he went to
the snakes with the vessel containing the nectar.</p>
<p>And he said from a distance to those foolish snakes, who were
terrified on account of the boon granted to him, &ldquo;Here is the
nectar brought by me, release my mother and take it; if you are afraid,
I will put it for you on a bed of Darbha grass. When I have procured my
mother&rsquo;s release, I will go; take the nectar thence.&rdquo; The
snakes consented, and then he put the vessel of nectar on a pure bed of
Ku&#347;a grass,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5575src" href="#xd27e5575"
name="xd27e5575src">15</a> and they let his mother go. So Garu&#7693;a
departed, having thus released his mother from slavery; but while the
snakes were unsuspectingly taking the nectar, Indra suddenly swooped
down, and bewildering them by his power, carried off the vessel of
nectar from the bed of Ku&#347;a grass. Then the snakes in despair
licked that bed of Darbha grass, thinking there might be a drop of
spilt nectar on it; the effect was that their tongues were split, and
they became double-tongued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>for nothing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5580src" href="#xd27e5580" name="xd27e5580src">16</a> What but
ridicule can ever be the portion of the over-greedy? Then the snakes
did not obtain the nectar of immortality, and their enemy Garu&#7693;a,
on the strength of Vish&#7751;u&rsquo;s boon, began to swoop down and
devour them. And this he did again and again. And while he was thus
attacking them, the snakes<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5588src" href=
"#xd27e5588" name="xd27e5588src">17</a> in P&aacute;t&aacute;la were
dead with fear, the females miscarried, and the whole serpent race was
well-nigh destroyed. And V&aacute;suki the king of the snakes, seeing
him there every day, considered that the serpent world was ruined at
one blow: then, after reflecting, he preferred a petition to that
Garu&#7693;a of irresistible might, and made this agreement with
him&mdash;&ldquo;I will send you every day one snake to eat, O king of
birds, on the hill that rises out of the sand of the sea. But you must
not act so foolishly as to enter P&aacute;t&aacute;la, for by the
destruction of the serpent world your own object will be
baffled.&rdquo; When V&aacute;suki said this to him, Garu&#7693;a
consented, and began to eat every day in this place one snake sent by
him: and in this way innumerable serpents have met their death here.
But I am a snake called &#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5596src" href="#xd27e5596" name="xd27e5596src">18</a> and it
is my turn to-day: for that reason I have to-day, by the command of the
king of the snakes, in order to furnish a meal to Garu&#7693;a, come to
this rock of execution, and to be lamented by my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana heard this speech of
&#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a&rsquo;s, he was grieved, and felt sorrow
in his heart and said to him, &ldquo;Alas! V&aacute;suki exercises his
kingly power in a very cowardly fashion, in that with his own hand he
conducts his subjects to serve as food for his enemy. Why did he not
first offer himself to Garu&#7693;a? To think of this effeminate
creature choosing to witness the destruction of his race! And how great
a sin does Garu&#7693;a, though the son of Ka&#347;yapa, commit! How
great folly do even great ones commit for the sake of the body only! So
I will to-day deliver you alone from Garu&#7693;a by surrendering my
body. Do not be despondent, my friend.&rdquo; When
&#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a heard this, he out of his firm patience
said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;This be far from thee, O great-hearted one,
do not say so again. The destruction of a jewel for the sake of a piece
of glass is never becoming. And I will never incur the reproach of
having disgraced my race.&rdquo; In these words the good snake
&#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a tried to dissuade
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, and thinking that the time of
Garu&#7693;a&rsquo;s arrival would come in a moment, he went to worship
in his last hour an image of &#346;iva under the name of Gokar&#7751;a,
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>stood on the shore of the sea. And when he was
gone, J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, that treasure-house of
compassion, considered that he had gained an opportunity of offering
himself up to save the snake&rsquo;s life. Thereupon he quickly
dismissed Mitr&aacute;vasu to his own house on the pretext of some
business, artfully pretending that he himself had forgotten it. And
immediately the earth near him trembled, being shaken by the wind of
the wings of the approaching Garu&#7693;a, as if through astonishment
at his valour. That made J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana think that
the enemy of the snakes was approaching, and full of compassion for
others he ascended the stone of execution. And in a moment Garu&#7693;a
swooped down, darkening the heaven with his shadow, and carried off
that great-hearted one, striking him with his beak. He shed drops of
blood, and his crest-jewel dropped off torn out by Garu&#7693;a, who
took him away and began to eat him on the peak of the mountain. At that
moment a rain of flowers fell from heaven, and Garu&#7693;a was
astonished when he saw it, wondering what it could mean.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile &#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a came there, having
worshipped Gokar&#7751;a, and saw the rock of execution sprinkled with
many drops of blood; then he thought&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! surely that
great-hearted one has offered himself for me, so I wonder where
Garu&#7693;a has taken him in this short time. I must search for him
quickly, perhaps I may find him.&rdquo; Accordingly the good snake went
following up the track of the blood. And in the meanwhile Garu&#7693;a,
seeing that J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was pleased, left off
eating and thought with wonder: &ldquo;This must be some one else,
other than I ought to have taken, for though I am eating him, he is not
at all miserable, on the contrary the resolute one rejoices.&rdquo;
While Garu&#7693;a was thinking this,
J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, though in such a state, said to him
in order to attain his object: &ldquo;O king of birds, in my body also
there is flesh and blood; then why have you suddenly stopped eating,
though your hunger is not appeased?&rdquo; When he heard that, that
king of birds, being overpowered with astonishment, said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Noble one, you are not a snake, tell me who you
are.&rdquo; J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana was just answering him,
&ldquo;I am a snake,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5618src" href=
"#xd27e5618" name="xd27e5618src">19</a> so eat me, complete what you
have begun, for men of resolution never leave unfinished an undertaking
they have begun,&rdquo; when &#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a arrived and
cried out from afar, &ldquo;Stop, stop, Garu&#7693;a, he is not a
snake, I am the snake meant for you, so let him go, alas! how have you
suddenly come to make this mistake?&rdquo; On hearing that, the king of
birds was excessively bewildered, and J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana
was grieved at not having accomplished his desire. Then Garu&#7693;a,
learning, in the course of their conversation<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5627src" href="#xd27e5627" name="xd27e5627src">20</a> with one
another, that he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>begun to devour by mistake the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, was much grieved. He began to reflect, &ldquo;Alas!
in my cruelty I have incurred sin. In truth those who follow evil
courses easily contract guilt. But this great-hearted one who has given
his life for another, and despising<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5641src"
href="#xd27e5641" name="xd27e5641src">21</a> the world, which is
altogether under the dominion of illusion, come to face me, deserves
praise.&rdquo; Thinking thus, he was about to enter the fire to purify
himself from guilt, when J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana said to him:
&ldquo;King of birds, why do you despond? If you are really afraid of
guilt, then you must determine never again to eat these snakes: and you
must repent of eating all those previously devoured, for this is the
only remedy available in this case, it was idle for you ever to think
of any other.&rdquo; Thus J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, full of
compassion for creatures, said to Garu&#7693;a, and he was pleased and
accepted the advice of that king, as if he had been his spiritual
preceptor, determining to do what he recommended; and he went to bring
nectar from heaven to restore to life rapidly that wounded prince, and
the other snakes, whose bones only remained. Then the goddess
Gaur&iacute;, pleased with J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s devotion to her, came in person and rained nectar on him:
by that his limbs were reproduced with increased beauty, and the sound
of the drums of the rejoicing gods was heard at the same time. Then, on
his rising up safe and sound, Garu&#7693;a brought the nectar of
immortality<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5650src" href="#xd27e5650" name=
"xd27e5650src">22</a> from heaven, and sprinkled it along the whole
shore of the sea. That made all the snakes there rise up alive, and
then that forest along the shore of the sea, crowded with the numerous
tribe of snakes, appeared like P&aacute;t&aacute;la<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5662src" href="#xd27e5662" name="xd27e5662src">23</a> come to
behold J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana, having lost its previous
dread of Garu&#7693;a. Then J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana&rsquo;s
relations congratulated him, having seen that he was glorious with
unwounded body and undying fame. And his wife rejoiced with her
relations, and his parents also. Who would not joy at pain ending in
happiness? And with his permission &#346;ankach&uacute;&#7693;a
departed to Ras&aacute;tala,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5665src" href=
"#xd27e5665" name="xd27e5665src">24</a> and without it his glory, of
its own accord, spread through the three worlds. Then, by virtue of the
favour of the daughter of the Him&aacute;laya all his relations,
Matanga and others, who were long hostile to him, came to Garu&#7693;a,
before whom the troops of gods were inclining out of love, and timidly
approaching the glory of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race, prostrated
themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>at his feet. And being entreated by them, the
benevolent <span class="corr" id="xd27e5670" title=
"Source: J&iacute;m&uacute;tavah&aacute;na">J&iacute;m&uacute;tav&aacute;hana</span>
went from that Malaya mountain to his own home, the slope of the
Him&aacute;laya. There, accompanied by his parents and Mitr&aacute;vasu
and Malayavat&iacute;, the resolute one long enjoyed the honour of
emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. Thus a course of fortunate events
always of its own accord follows the footsteps of all those, whose
exploits arouse the admiration of the three worlds. When the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; heard this story from the mouth of
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
she rejoiced, as she was eager to hear of the splendour of her unborn
son. Then, in the society of her husband, she spent that day in
conversation about her son, who was to be the future king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, which was suggested by that story, for she placed
unfailing reliance upon the promise of the favouring gods.</p>

<p class="first">Then V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; on the next day said to
the king of Vatsa in private, while he was surrounded by his
ministers;&mdash;&ldquo;My husband, ever since I have been pregnant
with this child, the difficult duty of taking care of it afflicts my
heart; and last night, after thinking over it long, I fell asleep with
difficulty, and I am persuaded I saw a certain man come in my dream,
glorious with a shape distinguished by matted auburn locks and a
trident-bearing hand; and he approaching me, said as if moved by
compassion,&mdash;&lsquo;My daughter, you need not feel at all anxious
about the child with which you are pregnant, I will protect it, for I
gave it to you. And hear something more, which I will tell you to make
you confide in me; a certain woman waits to make a petition to you
to-morrow, she will come dragging her husband with her as a prisoner,
reviling him, accompanied by five sons, begirt with many relations: and
she is a wicked woman who desires by the help of her relations to get
that husband of hers put to death, and all that she will say will be
false. And you, my daughter, must beforehand inform the king of Vatsa
about this matter, in order that that good man may be freed from that
wicked wife.&rsquo; This command that august one gave and vanished, and
I immediately woke up, and lo! the morning had come.&rdquo; When the
queen had said that, all spoke of the favour of &#346;iva, and were
astonished, their minds eagerly expecting the fulfilment of the dream;
when lo! at that very moment the chief warder entered, and suddenly
said to the king of Vatsa, who was compassionate to the afflicted,
&ldquo;O king, a certain woman has come to make a representation,
accompanied by her relations, bringing with her five sons, reviling her
helpless husband.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>When the king heard that, being
astonished at the way it tallied with the queen&rsquo;s dream, he
commanded the warder to bring her into his presence. And the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; felt the greatest delight, having become
certain that she would obtain a good son, on account of the truth of
the dream. Then that woman entered by the command of the warder,
accompanied by her husband, looked at with curiosity by all, who had
their faces turned towards the door. Then, having entered, she assumed
an expression of misery, and making a bow according to rule, she
addressed the king in council accompanied by the queen: &ldquo;This
man, though he is my husband, does not give to me, helpless woman that
I am, food, raiment, and other necessaries, and yet I am free from
blame with respect to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had said this, her husband pleaded&mdash;&ldquo;King, this
woman speaks falsely, supported by her relations, for she wishes me to
be put to death. For I have given her supplies beforehand to last till
the end of the year, and other relations of hers, who are impartial,
are prepared to witness the truth of this for me.&rdquo; When he had
said this to the king, the king of his own accord answered: &ldquo;The
trident-bearing god himself has given evidence in this case, appearing
to the queen in a dream. What need have we of more witnesses? This
woman with her relations must be punished.&rdquo; When the king had
delivered this judgment, the discreet Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
said, &ldquo;Nevertheless, king, we must do what is right in accordance
with the evidence of witnesses, otherwise the people, not knowing of
the dream, would in no wise believe in the justice of our
proceedings.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he consented and had the
witnesses summoned that moment, and they, being asked, deposed that
that woman was speaking falsely. Then the king banished her, as she was
plotting against one well known to be a good husband, from his
territory, with her relations and her sons. And with heart melting from
pity he discharged her good husband, after giving him much treasure
sufficient for another marriage. And in connexion with the whole affair
the king remarked,&mdash;&ldquo;An evil wife, of wildly<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5685src" href="#xd27e5685" name="xd27e5685src">1</a>
cruel nature, tears her still living husband like a she-wolf, when he
has fallen into the pit of calamity; but an affectionate, noble, and
magnanimous wife averts sorrow as the shade<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5693src" href="#xd27e5693" name="xd27e5693src">2</a> of the
wayside-tree averts heat, and is acquired by a man&rsquo;s special
merits.&rdquo; Then Vasantaka, who was a clever story-teller, being at
the king&rsquo;s side, said to him <i lang="la">&agrave; propos</i> of
this: &ldquo;Moreover, king, hatred and affection are commonly produced
in living beings in this world owing to their continually recalling the
impressions of a past state of existence, and in proof of this, hear
the story which I am about to tell.&rdquo; <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of Sinhapar&aacute;krama.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a king in Benares named
Vikramacha&#7751;&#7693;a, and he had <span class="corr" id="xd27e5711"
title="Not in source">a</span> favourite follower named
Sinhapar&aacute;krama; who was wonderfully successful in all battles
and in all gambling contests. And he had a wife very deformed both in
body and mind, called by a name, which expressed her nature,
Kalahak&aacute;r&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5714src" href=
"#xd27e5714" name="xd27e5714src">3</a> This brave man continually
obtained much money both from the king and from gambling, and, as soon
as he got it, he gave it all to his wife. But the shrewish woman,
backed by her three sons begotten by him, could not in spite of this
remain one moment without a quarrel. She continually worried him by
yelling out these words at him with her sons&mdash;&ldquo;You are
always eating and drinking away from home, and you never give us
anything.&rdquo; And though he was for ever trying to propitiate her
with meat, drink, and raiment, she tortured him day and night like an
interminable thirst. Then, at last, Sinhapar&aacute;krama vexed with
indignation on that account, left his house, and went on a pilgrimage
to the goddess Durg&aacute; that dwells in the Vindhya hills. While he
was fasting, the goddess said to him in a dream: &ldquo;Rise up, my
son, go to thy own city of Benares; there is an enormous
<i>nyagrodha</i> tree, by digging round its root thou wilt at once
obtain a treasure. And in the treasure thou wilt find a dish of
emerald, bright as a sword-blade, looking like a piece of the sky
fallen down to earth; casting thy eyes on that, thou wilt see, as it
were, reflected inside, the previous existence of every individual, in
whatever case thou mayest wish to know it. By means of that thou wilt
learn the previous birth of thy wife and of thyself, and having learned
the truth wilt dwell there in happiness free from grief.&rdquo; Having
thus been addressed by the goddess, Sinhapar&aacute;krama woke up and
broke his fast, and went in the morning to Benares; and after he had
reached the city, he found at the root of the <i>nyagrodha</i> tree a
treasure, and in it he discovered a large emerald dish, and, eager to
learn the truth, he saw in that dish that in a previous birth his wife
had been a terrible she-bear, and himself a lion. And so recognising
that the hatred between himself and his wife was irremediable owing to
the influence of bitter enmity in a previous birth, he abandoned grief
and bewilderment. Then Sinhapar&aacute;krama examined many maidens by
means of the dish, and discovering that they had belonged to alien
races in a previous birth, he avoided them, but after he had discovered
one, who had been a lioness in a previous birth and so was a suitable
match for him, he married her as his second wife, and her name was
Sinha&#347;r&iacute;. And after assigning to that
Kalahak&aacute;r&iacute; one village only as her portion, he lived,
delighted with the acquisition of treasure, in the society of his new
wife. Thus, O king, wives and others are friendly or hostile to men in
this world by virtue of impressions in a previous state of existence.

<p>When the king of Vatsa had heard this wonderful story from
Vasantaka, he was exceedingly delighted and so was the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. And the king was never weary day or night of
contemplating the moon-like face of the pregnant queen. And as days
went on, there were born to all of his ministers in due course sons
with auspicious marks, who heralded approaching good fortune. First
there was born to Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, the chief minister, a
son Marubh&uacute;ti by name. Then Ruma&#7751;vat had a son called
Hari&#347;ikha, and to Vasantaka there was born a son named Tapantaka.
And to the head-warder called Nityodita, whose other title was
Ityaka,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5728src" href="#xd27e5728" name=
"xd27e5728src">4</a> there was born a son named Gomukha. And after they
were born a great feast took place, and during it a bodiless voice was
heard from heaven&mdash;&ldquo;These ministers shall crush the race of
the enemies of the son of the king of Vatsa here, the future universal
emperor. And as days went by, the time drew near for the birth of the
child, with which the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; was destined to
present the king of Vatsa, and she repaired to the ornamented
lying-in-chamber, which was prepared by matrons having sons, and the
windows of which were covered with <i lang="sa-latn">arka</i> and
<i lang="sa-latn">&#347;am&iacute;</i> plants. The room was hung with
various weapons, rendered auspicious by being mixed with the gleam of
jewel-lamps, shedding a blaze<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5740src" href=
"#xd27e5740" name="xd27e5740src">5</a> able to protect the child; and
secured by conjurers who went through innumerable charms and spells and
other incantations, so that it became a fortress of the matrons hard
for calamity to storm, and there she brought forth in good time a
prince of lovely aspect, as the heaven brings forth the moon from which
stream pure nectarous rays. The child, when born, not only irradiated
that room, but the heart also of that mother from which the darkness of
grief had departed; then, as the delight of the inmates of the harem
was gradually extended, the king heard of the birth of a son from the
people who were admitted to it; the reason he did not give his kingdom
in his delight to the person, who announced it, was, that he was afraid
of committing an impropriety, not that he was avaricious. And so the
king, suddenly coming to the harem with longing mind, beheld his son,
and his hope bore fruit after a long delay. The child had a long red
lower lip like a leaf, beautiful flowing hair like wool, and his whole
face was like the lotus, which the goddess of the Fortune of empire
carries for her delight. He was marked on his soft feet with umbrellas
and <i>chowries</i>, as if the Fortunes of other kings had beforehand
abandoned their badges in his favour, out of fear. Then, while the king
shed with tearful eye, that swelled with the pressure of the fulness of
the weight of his joy, drops that seemed to be drops of paternal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>affection,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5756src"
href="#xd27e5756" name="xd27e5756src">6</a> and the ministers with
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a at their head rejoiced, a voice was heard
from heaven at that time to the following effect:</p>
<p>&ldquo;King, this son that is born to thee is an incarnation of
K&aacute;ma,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5763src" href="#xd27e5763"
name="xd27e5763src">7</a> and know that his name is
Narav&aacute;hanadatta; and he will soon become emperor of the kings of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and maintain that position unwearied for a
<i>kalpa</i> of the gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5769src"
href="#xd27e5769" name="xd27e5769src">8</a> When so much had been said,
the voice stopped, and immediately a rain of flowers fell from heaven,
and the sounds of the celestial drums went forth. Then the king,
excessively delighted, made a great feast, which was rendered all the
more solemn from the gods having begun it. The sound of cymbals floated
in the air rising from temples, as if to tell all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas of the birth of their king: and red banners, flying
in the wind on the tops of the palaces, seemed with their splendour to
fling red dye to one another. On earth beautiful women assembled and
danced everywhere, as if they were the nymphs of heaven glad that the
god of love had been born with a body.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5772src" href="#xd27e5772" name="xd27e5772src">9</a> And the
whole city appeared equally splendid with new dresses and ornaments
bestowed by the rejoicing king. For while that rich king rained riches
upon his dependants, nothing but the treasury was empty. And the ladies
belonging to the families of the neighbouring chieftains came in from
all sides, with auspicious prayers, versed in the good custom,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5778src" href="#xd27e5778" name=
"xd27e5778src">10</a> accompanied by dancing girls, bringing with them
splendid presents, escorted by various excellent guards, attended with
the sound of musical instruments, like all the cardinal points in
bodily form. Every movement there was of the nature of a dance, every
word uttered was attended with full vessels,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5782src" href="#xd27e5782" name="xd27e5782src">11</a> every
action was of the nature of munificence, the city resounded with
musical instruments, the people were adorned with red powder, and the
earth was covered with bards,&mdash;all these things were so in that
city which was all full of festivity. Thus the great feast was carried
on with increasing magnificence for many days, and did not come to an
end before the wishes of the citizens were fully satisfied. And as days
went on, that infant prince grew like the new moon, and his father
bestowed on him with appropriate formalities the name of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>which had been previously assigned
him by the heavenly voice. His father was delighted when he saw him
make his first two or three tottering steps, in which gleamed the sheen
of his smooth fair toe-nails, and when he heard him utter his first two
or three indistinct words, shewing his teeth which looked like buds.
Then the excellent ministers brought to the infant prince their infant
sons, who delighted the heart of the king, and commended them to him.
First <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
brought Marubh&uacute;ti, and then Ruma&#7751;vat Hari&#347;ikha, and
then the head-warder named Ityaka brought Gomukha, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e5790" title="Source: Vasa&#7751;taka">Vasantaka</span>
his son named Tapantaka. And the domestic chaplain
&#346;&aacute;ntikara presented the two twin sons of Pingalik&aacute;,
his nephews &#346;&aacute;ntisoma and Vai&#347;v&aacute;nara. And at
that moment there fell from heaven a rain of flowers from the gods,
which a shout of joy made all the more auspicious, and the king
rejoiced with the queens, having bestowed presents on that company of
ministers&rsquo; sons. And that prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta was
always surrounded by those six ministers&rsquo; sons devoted to him
alone, who commanded respect even in their boyhood,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5793src" href="#xd27e5793" name="xd27e5793src">12</a> as if
with the six political measures that are the cause of great prosperity.
The days of the lord of Vatsa passed in great happiness, while he gazed
affectionately on his son with his smiling lotus-like face, going from
lap to lap of the kings whose minds were lovingly attached to him, and
making in his mirth a charming indistinct playful prattling.

<p>Thus the king of Vatsa and his queen remained engaged in bringing up
their only son Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and once on a time the minister
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, seeing the king anxious about taking care
of him, said to him as he was alone,&mdash;&ldquo;King, you must never
feel any anxiety now about the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta, for he
has been created by the adorable god &#346;iva in your house as the
future emperor over the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas; and by their
divine power the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas have found this out,
and meaning mischief have become troubled, unable in their hearts to
endure it; and knowing this, the god with the moon-crest has appointed
a prince of the Ga&#7751;as,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5816src" href=
"#xd27e5816" name="xd27e5816src">2</a> Stambhaka by name, to protect
him. And he remains here invisible, protecting this son of yours, and
N&aacute;rada coming swiftly informed me of this.&rdquo; While the
minister was uttering these words, there descended from the midst of
the air a divine man wearing a diadem and a bracelet, and armed with a
sword. He bowed, and then the king of Vatsa, after welcoming him,
immediately asked him with curiosity: &ldquo;Who are you, and what is
your errand here?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I was once a mortal, but I
have now become a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named &#346;aktivega
and I have many enemies. I have found out by my power that your son is
destined to be our emperor, and I have come to see him, O king.&rdquo;
When &#346;aktivega, over-awed at the sight of his future emperor, had
said this, the king of Vatsa was pleased and again asked him in his
astonishment, &ldquo;How can the rank of a Vidy&aacute;dhara be
attained, and of what nature is it, and how did you obtain it? Tell me
this, my friend.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s,
that Vidy&aacute;dhara &#346;aktivega courteously bowing, answered him
thus, &ldquo;O king, resolute souls having propitiated &#346;iva either
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=

favour the rank of Vidy&aacute;dhara. And that rank, denoted by the
insignia of supernatural knowledge, of sword, garland and so on, is of
various kinds, but listen! I will tell you how I obtained it. Having
said this, &#346;aktivega told the following story, relating to
himself, in the presence of the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived long ago in a city called
Vardham&aacute;na,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5826src" href=
"#xd27e5826" name="xd27e5826src">3</a> the ornament of the earth, a
king the terror of his foes, called Paropak&aacute;rin. And this
exalted monarch possessed a queen of the name of
Kanakaprabh&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5829src" href=
"#xd27e5829" name="xd27e5829src">4</a> as the cloud holds the
lightning, but she had not the fickleness of the lightning. And in
course of time there was born to him by that queen a daughter, who
seemed to have been formed by the Creator to dash
Lakshm&iacute;&rsquo;s pride in her beauty. And that moon of the eyes
of the world was gradually reared to womanhood by her father, who gave
her the name of Kanakarekh&aacute; suggested by her mother&rsquo;s name
Kanakaprabh&aacute;. Once on a time, when she had grown up, the king,
her father, said to the queen Kanakaprabh&aacute;, who came to him in
secret: &ldquo;A grown up daughter cannot be kept in one&rsquo;s house,
accordingly Kanakarekh&aacute; troubles my heart with anxiety about a
suitable marriage for her. For a maiden of good family, who does not
obtain a proper position, is like a song out of tune; when heard of by
the ears even of one unconnected with her, she causes distress. But a
daughter, who through folly is made over to one not suitable, is like
learning imparted to one not fit to receive it, and cannot tend to
glory or merit but only to regret. So I am very anxious as to what king
I must give this daughter of mine to, and who will be a fit match for
her.&rdquo; When Kanakaprabh&aacute; heard this, she laughed and
said,&mdash;&ldquo;You say this, but your daughter does not wish to be
married; for to-day when she was playing with a doll and making believe
it was a child, I said to her in fun, &lsquo;My daughter, when shall I
see you married?&rsquo; When she heard that, she answered me
reproachfully: &lsquo;Do not say so, you must not marry me to any one;
and my separation from you is not appointed, I do well enough as a
maiden, but if I am married, know that I shall be a corpse; there is a
certain reason for this.&rsquo; As she has said this to me I have come
to you, O king, in a state of distress; for, as she has refused to be
married, what use is there in deliberating about a bridegroom?&rdquo;
When the king heard this from the queen, he was bewildered, and going
to the private apartments of the princess he said to his daughter:
&ldquo;When the maidens of the gods and Asuras practise austerities in
order to obtain a husband, why, my daughter, do you refuse to take
one?&rdquo; When the princess Kanakarekh&aacute; heard this speech of
her father&rsquo;s, she fixed her eyes on the ground and said,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5834" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Father, I do not desire to be married at
present, so what object has my father in it, and why does he insist
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>upon it?&rdquo; That king Paropak&aacute;rin,
when his daughter addressed him in that way, being the discreetest of
men, thus answered her: &ldquo;How can sin be avoided unless a daughter
is given in marriage? And independence is not fit for a maiden who
ought to be in dependence on relations? For a daughter in truth is born
for the sake of another and is kept for him. The house of her father is
not a fit place for her except in childhood. For if a daughter reaches
puberty unmarried, her relations go to hell, and she is an outcast, and
her bridegroom is called the husband of an outcast.&rdquo; When her
father said this to her, the princess Kanakarekh&aacute; immediately
uttered a speech that was in her mind, &ldquo;Father, if this is so,
then whatever Br&aacute;hman or Kshatriya has succeeded in seeing the
city called the Golden City, to him I must be given, and he shall be my
husband, and if none such is found, you must not unjustly reproach
me.&rdquo; When his daughter said that to him, that king reflected:
&ldquo;It is a good thing at any rate that she has agreed to be married
on a certain condition, and no doubt she is some goddess born in my
house for a special reason, for else how comes she to know so much
though she is a child?&rdquo; Such were the king&rsquo;s reflections at
that time: so he said to his daughter, &ldquo;I will do as you
wish,&rdquo; and then he rose up and did his day&rsquo;s work. And on
the next day, as he was sitting in the hall of audience, he said to his
courtiers, &ldquo;Has any one among you seen the city called the Golden
City? Whoever has seen it, if he be a Br&aacute;hman or a Kshatriya, I
will give him my daughter Kanakarekh&aacute;, and make him
crown-prince.&rdquo; And they all, looking at one another&rsquo;s
faces, said, &ldquo;We have not even heard of it, much less have we
seen it.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Then
the king summoned the warder and said to him, &ldquo;Go and cause a
proclamation to be circulated in the whole of this town with the
beating of drums, and find out if any one has really seen that
city.&rdquo; When the warder received this order, he said, &ldquo;I
will do so,&rdquo; and went out; and after he had gone out, he
immediately gave orders to the police, and caused a drum to be beaten
all round the city, thus arousing curiosity to hear the proclamation,
which ran as follows: &ldquo;Whatever Br&aacute;hman or Kshatriya youth
has seen the city called the Golden City, let him speak, and the king
will give him his daughter and the rank of crown-prince.&rdquo; Such
was the astounding announcement proclaimed all about the town after the
drum had been beaten. And the citizens said, after hearing that
proclamation: &ldquo;What is this Golden City that is to-day proclaimed
in our town, which has never been heard of or seen even by those among
us who are old?&rdquo; But not a single one among them said, &ldquo;I
have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile a Br&aacute;hman living in that town,
&#346;aktideva by name, the son of Baladeva, heard that proclamation;
that youth, being addicted to vice, had been rapidly stripped of his
wealth at the gaming-table, and he reflected, being excited by hearing
of the giving in marriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of the king&rsquo;s daughter:
&ldquo;As I have lost all my wealth by gambling, I cannot now enter the
house of my father, nor even the house of a <i>het&aelig;ra</i>, so, as
I have no resource, it is better for me to assert falsely to those who
are making the proclamation by beat of drum, that I have seen that
city. Who will discover that I know nothing about it, for who has ever
seen it? And in this way I may perhaps marry the princess.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting &#346;aktideva went to the police, and said falsely,
&ldquo;I have seen that city.&rdquo; They immediately said to him,
&ldquo;Bravo! then come with us to the king&rsquo;s warder.&rdquo; So
he went with them to the warder. And in the same way he falsely
asserted to him that he had seen that city, and he welcomed him kindly,
and took him to the king. And without wavering he maintained the very
same story in the presence of the king: what indeed is difficult for a
blackleg to do who is ruined by play? Then the king, in order to
ascertain the truth, sent that Br&aacute;hman to his daughter
Kanakarekh&aacute;, and when she heard of the matter from the mouth of
the warder, and the Br&aacute;hman came near, she asked him:
&ldquo;Have you seen that Golden City?&rdquo; Then he answered her,
&ldquo;Yes, that city was seen by me when I was roaming through the
earth in quest of knowledge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5849src"
href="#xd27e5849" name="xd27e5849src">5</a> She next asked him,
&ldquo;By what road did you go there, and what is it like?&rdquo; That
Br&aacute;hman then went on to say: &ldquo;From this place I went to a
town called Harapura, and from that I next came to the city of Benares;
and from Benares in a few days to the city of
Pau&#7751;&#7693;ravardhana, thence I went to that city called the
Golden City, and I saw it, a place of enjoyment for those who act
aright, like the city of Indra, the glory of which is made for the
delight of gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5858src" href="#xd27e5858"
name="xd27e5858src">6</a> And having acquired learning there, I
returned here after some time; such is the path by which I went, and
such is that city.&rdquo; After that fraudulent Br&aacute;hman
&#346;aktideva had made up this story, the princess said with a
laugh;&mdash;&ldquo;Great Br&aacute;hman, you have indeed seen that
city, but tell me, tell me again by what path you went.&rdquo; When
&#346;aktideva heard that, he again displayed his effrontery, and then
the princess had him put out by her servants. And immediately after
putting him out, she went to her father, and her father asked her:
&ldquo;Did that Br&aacute;hman speak the truth?&rdquo;&mdash;And then
the princess said to her father: &ldquo;Though you are a king you act
without due consideration; do you not know that rogues deceive honest
people? For that Br&aacute;hman simply wants to impose on me with a
falsehood, but the liar has never seen the golden city. And all kinds
of deceptions are practised on the earth by rogues; for listen to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=

will tell you.&rdquo; Having said this, the princess told the following
tale:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of &#346;iva and M&aacute;dhava.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is an excellent city rightly named
Ratnapura,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5868src" href="#xd27e5868" name=
"xd27e5868src">7</a> and in it there were two rogues named &#346;iva
and M&aacute;dhava. Surrounding themselves with many other rogues, they
contrived for a long time to rob, by making use of trickery, all the
rich men in the town. And one day those two deliberated together and
said&mdash;&ldquo;We have managed by this time to plunder this town
thoroughly; so let us now go and live in the city of Ujjayin&iacute;;
there we hear that there is a very rich man named
&#346;ankarasv&aacute;min, who is chaplain to the king. If we cheat him
out of his money we may thereby enjoy the charms of the ladies of
M&aacute;lava. He is spoken of by Br&aacute;hmans as a miser, because
he withholds<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5873src" href="#xd27e5873"
name="xd27e5873src">8</a> half their usual fee with a frowning face,
though he possesses treasure enough to fill seven vessels; and that
Br&aacute;hman has a pearl of a daughter spoken of as matchless, we
will manage to get her too out of him along with the money.&rdquo;
Having thus determined, and having arranged beforehand what part each
was to play, the two rogues &#346;iva and M&aacute;dhava went out of
that town. At last they reached Ujjayin&iacute;, and M&aacute;dhava,
with his attendants, disguised as a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t, remained in a
certain village outside the town. But &#346;iva, who was expert in
every kind of deception, having assumed perfectly the disguise of a
religious ascetic, first entered that town alone. There he took up his
quarters in a hut on the banks of the Sipr&aacute;, in which he placed,
so that they could be seen, clay, <i>darbha</i> grass, a vessel for
begging, and a deer-skin. And in the morning he anointed his body with
thick clay, as if testing beforehand his destined smearing with the mud
of the hell Av&iacute;chi. And plunging in the water of the river, he
remained a long time with his head downward, as if rehearsing
beforehand his future descent to hell, the result of his evil actions.
And when he rose up from his bath, he remained a long time looking up
towards the sun, as if shewing that he deserved to be impaled. Then he
went into the presence of the god and making rings of Ku&#347;a
grass,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5881src" href="#xd27e5881" name=
"xd27e5881src">9</a> and muttering prayers, he remained sitting in the
posture called Padm&aacute;sana,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5884src"
href="#xd27e5884" name="xd27e5884src">10</a> with a hypocritical
cunning face, and from time to time he made an offering to
Vish&#7751;u, having gathered white flowers, even as he took captive
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>simple hearts of the good by his villainy; and
having made his offering he again pretended to betake himself to
muttering his prayers, and prolonged his meditations as if fixing his
attention on wicked ways. And the next day, clothed in the skin of a
black antelope, he wandered about the city in quest of alms, like one
of his own deceitful leers intended to beguile it, and observing a
strict silence he took three handfuls of rice from
Br&aacute;hmans&rsquo; houses, still equipped with stick and deer-skin,
and divided the food into three parts like the three divisions of the
day, and part he gave to the crows, and part to his guest, and with the
third part he filled his maw; and he remained for a long time
hypocritically telling his beads, as if he were counting his sins at
the same time, and muttering prayers; and in the night he remained
alone in his hut, thinking over the weak points of his fellow-men, even
the smallest; and by thus performing every day a difficult pretended
penance he gained complete ascendancy over the minds of the citizens in
every quarter. And all the people became devoted to him, and a report
spread among them in every direction that &#346;iva was an exceedingly
self-denying hermit.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile his accomplice, the other rogue M&aacute;dhava,
having heard from his emissaries how he was getting on, entered that
city; and taking up his abode there in a distant temple, he went to the
bank of the Sipr&aacute; to bathe, disguised as a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t,
and after bathing, as he was returning with his retinue, he saw
&#346;iva praying in front of the god, and with great veneration he
fell at his feet, and said before all the people, &ldquo;There is no
other such ascetic in the world, for he has been often seen by me going
round from one holy place to another.&rdquo; But &#346;iva, though he
saw him, kept his neck immoveable out of cunning, and remained in the
same position as before, and M&aacute;dhava returned to his own
lodging. And at night those two met together and ate and drank, and
deliberated over the rest of their programme, what they must do next.
And in the last watch of the night &#346;iva went back leisurely to his
hut. And in the morning M&aacute;dhava said to one of his gang,
&ldquo;Take these two garments and give them as a present to the
domestic chaplain of the king here, who is called
&#346;ankarasv&aacute;min, and say to him respectfully: &lsquo;There is
a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t come from the Deccan of the name of
M&aacute;dhava, who has been oppressed by his relations, and he brings
with him much inherited wealth; he is accompanied by some other
R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts like himself, and he wishes to enter into the
service of your king here, and he has sent me to visit you, O
treasure-house of glory.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The rogue, who was sent
off by M&aacute;dhava with this message, went to the house of that
chaplain with the present in his hand, and after approaching him, and
giving him the present at a favourable moment, he delivered to him in
private M&aacute;dhava&rsquo;s message, as he had been ordered; he, for
his part, out of his greed for presents, believed it all, anticipating
other favours in the future, for a bribe <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>is the sovereign
specific for attracting the covetous. The rogue then came back, and on
the next day M&aacute;dhava, having obtained a favourable opportunity,
went in person to visit that chaplain, accompanied by attendants, who
hypocritically assumed the appearance of men desiring service,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5894src" href="#xd27e5894" name=
"xd27e5894src">11</a> passing themselves off as R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts,
distinguished by the maces they carried; he had himself announced by an
attendant preceding him, and thus he approached the family priest, who
received him with welcomes which expressed his delight at his arrival.
Then M&aacute;dhava remained engaged in conversation with him for some
time, and at last being dismissed by him, returned to his own house. On
the next day he sent another couple of garments as a present, and again
approached that chaplain and said to him, &ldquo;I indeed wish to enter
into service to please my retainers, for that reason I have repaired to
you, but I possess wealth.&rdquo; When the chaplain heard that, he
hoped to get something out of him, and he promised M&aacute;dhava to
procure for him what he desired, and he immediately went and petitioned
the king on this account, and, out of respect for the chaplain, the
king consented to do what he asked. And on the next day the family
priest took M&aacute;dhava and his retinue, and presented them to the
king with all due respect. The king too, when he saw that
M&aacute;dhava resembled a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t in appearance, received
him graciously and appointed him a salary. Then M&aacute;dhava remained
there in attendance upon the king, and every night he met &#346;iva to
deliberate with him. And the chaplain entreated him to live with him in
his house, out of avarice, as he was intent on presents.</p>
<p>Then M&aacute;dhava with his followers repaired to the house of the
chaplain; this settlement was the cause of the chaplain&rsquo;s ruin,
as that of the mouse in the trunk of the tree was the cause of its
ruin. And he deposited a safe in the strong room of the chaplain, after
filling it with ornaments made of false gems. And from time to time he
opened the box and by cunningly half-shewing some of the jewels, he
captivated the mind of the chaplain as that of a cow is captivated by
grass. And when he had gained in this way the confidence of the
chaplain, he made his body emaciated by taking little food, and falsely
pretended that he was ill. And after a few days had passed, that prince
of rogues said with weak voice to that chaplain, who was at his
bedside; &ldquo;My condition is miserable in this body, so bring, good
Br&aacute;hman, some distinguished man of your caste, in order that I
may bestow my wealth upon him for my happiness here and hereafter, for,
life being unstable, what care can a wise man have for riches?&rdquo;
That chaplain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>who was devoted to presents, when addressed in
this way, said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and M&aacute;dhava fell at
his feet. Then whatever Br&aacute;hman the chaplain brought,
M&aacute;dhava refused to receive, pretending that he wanted a more
distinguished one. One of the rogues in attendance upon M&aacute;dhava,
when he saw this, said&mdash;&ldquo;Probably an ordinary Br&aacute;hman
does not please him. So it will be better now to find out whether the
strict ascetic on the banks of Sipr&aacute; named &#346;iva pleases him
or not?&rdquo; When M&aacute;dhava heard that, he said plaintively to
that chaplain: &ldquo;Yes, be kind, and bring him, for there is no
other Br&aacute;hman like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chaplain, thus entreated, went near &#346;iva, and beheld him
immoveable, pretending to be engaged in meditation. And then he walked
round him, keeping him on his right hand, and sat down in front of him:
and immediately the rascal slowly opened his eyes. Then the family
priest, bending before him, said with bowed head,&mdash;&ldquo;My Lord,
if it will not make you angry, I will prefer a petition to you. There
is dwelling here a very rich R&aacute;jp&uacute;t from the Deccan,
named M&aacute;dhava, and he, being ill, is desirous of giving away his
whole property: if you consent, he will give you that treasure which
glitters with many ornaments made out of priceless gems.&rdquo; When
&#346;iva heard that, he slowly broke silence, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;O
Br&aacute;hman, since I live on alms, and observe perpetual chastity,
of what use are riches to me?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Then that chaplain went on to say to
him, &ldquo;Do not say that, great Br&aacute;hman, do you not know the
due order of the periods in the life of a Br&aacute;hman?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5908src" href="#xd27e5908" name=
"xd27e5908src">12</a> By marrying a wife, and performing in his house
offerings to the Manes, sacrifices to the gods and hospitality to
guests, he uses his property to obtain the three objects of
life;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5923src" href="#xd27e5923" name=
"xd27e5923src">13</a> the stage of the householder is the most useful
of all.&rdquo; Then &#346;iva said, &ldquo;How can I take a wife, for I
will not marry a woman from any low family?&rdquo; When the covetous
chaplain heard that, he thought that he would be able to enjoy his
wealth at will, and, catching at the opportunity, he said to him:
&ldquo;I have an unmarried daughter named Vinayasv&aacute;min&iacute;,
and she is very beautiful, I will bestow her in marriage on you. And I
will keep for you all the wealth which you receive as a donation from
M&aacute;dhava, so enter on the duties of a householder.<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When &#346;iva heard this,
having got the very thing he wanted, he said, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, if
your heart is set on this,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5940src" href=
"#xd27e5940" name="xd27e5940src">14</a> I will do what you say. But I
am an ascetic who knows nothing about gold and jewels: I shall act as
you advise; do as you think best.&rdquo; When the chaplain heard that
speech of &#346;iva&rsquo;s, he was delighted, and the fool said,
&ldquo;Agreed&rdquo;&mdash;and conducted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>&#346;iva to his
house. And when he had introduced there that inauspicious guest named
&#346;iva,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5951src" href="#xd27e5951" name=
"xd27e5951src">15</a> he told M&aacute;dhava what he had done and was
applauded by him. And immediately he gave &#346;iva his daughter, who
had been carefully brought up, and in giving her he seemed to be giving
away his own prosperity lost by his folly. And on the third day after
his marriage, he took him to M&aacute;dhava who was pretending to be
ill, to receive his present. And M&aacute;dhava rose up and fell at his
feet and said what was quite true, &ldquo;I adore thee whose asceticism
is incomprehensible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5956src" href=
"#xd27e5956" name="xd27e5956src">16</a> <a id="xd27e5959" name=
"xd27e5959"></a>And in accordance with the prescribed form he bestowed
on &#346;iva that box of ornaments made of many sham jewels, which was
brought from the chaplain&rsquo;s treasury. &#346;iva for his part,
after receiving it, gave it into the hand of the chaplain, saying,
&ldquo;I know nothing about this, but you do.&rdquo; And that priest
immediately took it, saying, &ldquo;I undertook to do this long ago,
why should you trouble yourself about it?&rdquo; Then &#346;iva gave
them his blessing, and went to his wife&rsquo;s private apartments, and
the chaplain took the box and put it in his strong room. M&aacute;dhava
for his part gradually desisted from feigning sickness, affecting to
feel better the next day, and said that his disease had been cured by
virtue of his great gift. And he praised the chaplain when he came
near, saying to him, &ldquo;It was by your aiding me in an act of faith
that I tided over this calamity.&rdquo; And he openly struck up a
friendship with &#346;iva, asserting that it was due to the might of
&#346;iva&rsquo;s holiness that his life had been saved. &#346;iva, for
his part, after some days said to the chaplain: &ldquo;How long am I to
feast in your house in this style? Why do you not take from me those
jewels for some fixed sum of money? If they are valuable, give me a
fair price for them.&rdquo; When the priest heard that, thinking that
the jewels were of incalculable value, he consented, and gave to
&#346;iva as purchase-money his whole living. And he made &#346;iva
sign a receipt for the sum with his own hand, and he himself too signed
a receipt for the jewels, thinking that that treasure far exceeded his
own wealth in value. And they separated, taking one another&rsquo;s
receipts, and the chaplain lived in one place, while &#346;iva kept
house in another. And then &#346;iva and M&aacute;dhava dwelt together
and remained there leading a very pleasant life consuming the
chaplain&rsquo;s wealth. And as time went on, that chaplain, being in
need of cash, went to the town to sell one of the ornaments in the
bazar.</p>
<p>Then the merchants, who were connoisseurs in jewels, said after
examining it, &ldquo;Ha! the man who made these sham jewels was a
clever fellow, whoever he was. For this ornament is composed of pieces
of glass and quartz coloured with various colours and fastened together
with brass, and there are no gems or gold in it.&rdquo; When the
chaplain heard that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span>he went in his agitation and brought all
the ornaments from his house, and showed them to the merchants. When
they saw them, they said that all of them were composed of sham jewels
in the same way; but the chaplain, when he heard that, was, so to
speak, thunderstruck. And immediately the fool went off and said to
&#346;iva, &ldquo;Take back your ornaments and give me back my own
wealth.&rdquo; But &#346;iva answered him, &ldquo;How can I possibly
have retained your wealth till now? Why it has all in course of time
been consumed in my house.&rdquo; Then the chaplain and &#346;iva fell
into an altercation, and went, both of them, before the king, at whose
side M&aacute;dhava was standing. And the chaplain made this
representation to the king: &ldquo;&#346;iva has consumed all my
substance, taking advantage of my not knowing that a great treasure,
which he deposited in my house,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5965src"
href="#xd27e5965" name="xd27e5965src">17</a> was composed of skilfully
coloured pieces of glass and quartz fastened together with
brass.&rdquo; Then &#346;iva said, &ldquo;King, from my childhood I
have been a hermit, and I was persuaded by that man&rsquo;s earnest
petition to accept a donation, and when I took it, though inexperienced
in the ways of the world, I said to him, &lsquo;I am no connoisseur in
jewels and things of that kind, and I rely upon you,&rsquo; and he
consented saying, &lsquo;I will be your warrant in the matter.&rsquo;
And I accepted all the donation and deposited it in his hand. Then he
bought the whole from me at his own price, and we hold from one another
mutual receipts; and now it is in the king&rsquo;s power to grant me
help in my sorest need.&rdquo; &#346;iva having thus finished his
speech, M&aacute;dhava said, &ldquo;Do not say this, you are
honourable, but what fault have I committed in the matter? I never
received anything either from you or from &#346;iva; I had some wealth
inherited from my father, which I had long deposited elsewhere; then I
brought that wealth and presented it to a Br&aacute;hman. If the gold
is not real gold, and the jewels are not real jewels, then let us
suppose that I have reaped fruit from giving away brass, quartz, and
glass. But the fact that I was persuaded with sincere heart that I was
giving something, is clear from this, that I recovered from a very
dangerous illness.&rdquo; When M&aacute;dhava said this to him without
any alteration in the expression of his face, the king laughed and all
his ministers, and they were highly delighted. And those present in
court said, laughing in their sleeves, &ldquo;Neither M&aacute;dhava
nor &#346;iva has done anything unfair.&rdquo; Thereupon that chaplain
departed with downcast countenance, having lost his wealth. For of what
calamities is not the blinding of the mind with excessive greed the
cause? And so those two rogues &#346;iva and M&aacute;dhava long
remained there, happy in having obtained the favour of the delighted
king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus do rogues spread the webs of their tongue with hundreds
of intricate threads, like fishermen upon dry land, living by the net.
So you may be certain, my father, that this Br&aacute;hman is a case in
point. By falsely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span>asserting that he has seen the City of
Gold, he wishes to deceive you, and to obtain me for a wife. So do not
be in a hurry to get me married; I shall remain unmarried at present,
and we will see what will happen.&rdquo; When the king
Paropak&aacute;rin heard this from his daughter Kanakarekh&aacute;, he
thus answered her: &ldquo;When a girl is grown up, it is not expedient
that she should remain long unmarried, for wicked people envious of
good qualities, falsely impute sin. And people are particularly fond of
blackening the character of one distinguished; to illustrate this,
listen to the story of Harasv&aacute;min which I am about to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

Kusumapura,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5988src" href="#xd27e5988" name=

places, named Harasv&aacute;min. He was a Br&aacute;hman living by
begging; and constructing a hut on the banks of the Ganges, he became,
on account of his surprisingly rigid asceticism, the object of the
people&rsquo;s respect.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5994src" href=
"#xd27e5994" name="xd27e5994src">20</a> And one day a wicked man among
the inhabitants, who could not tolerate his virtue, seeing him from a
distance going out to beg, said, &ldquo;Do you know what a hypocritical
ascetic that is? It is he that has eaten up all the children in this
town.&rdquo; When a second there who was like him, heard this, he said,
&ldquo;It is true, I also have heard people saying this.&rdquo; And a
third confirming it said, &ldquo;Such is the fact.&rdquo; The chain of
villains&rsquo; conversation binds reproach on the good. And in this
way the report spread from ear to ear, and gained general credence in
the city. And all the citizens kept their children by force in their
houses, saying, &ldquo;Harasv&aacute;min carries off all the children
and eats them.&rdquo; And then the Br&aacute;hmans in that town, afraid
that their offspring would be destroyed, assembled and deliberated
about his banishment from the city. And as they did not dare to tell
him face to face, for fear he might perhaps eat them up in his rage,
they sent messengers to him. And those messengers went and said to him
from a distance; &ldquo;The Br&aacute;hmans command you to depart from
this city.&rdquo; Then in his astonishment he asked them
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; And they went on to say; &ldquo;You eat every child
as soon as you see it.&rdquo; When Harasv&aacute;min heard that, he
went near those Br&aacute;hmans, in order to reassure them, and the
people fled before him for fear. And the Br&aacute;hmans, as soon as
they saw him, were terrified and went up to the top of their monastery.
People who are deluded by reports are not, as a rule, capable of
discrimination. Then <span class="corr" id="xd27e6003" title=
"Source: H&#803;arasv&aacute;min">Harasv&aacute;min</span> standing
below called all the Br&aacute;hmans who were above, one by one, by
name, and said to them, &ldquo;What delusion is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>this, Br&aacute;hmans? Why do you not ascertain
with one another how many children I have eaten, and whose, and how
many of each man&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; When they heard that, the
Br&aacute;hmans began to compare notes among themselves, and found that
all of them had all their children left alive. And in course of time
other citizens, appointed to investigate the matter, admitted that all
their children were living. And merchants and Br&aacute;hmans and all
said, &ldquo;Alas in our folly we have belied a holy man; the children
of all of us are alive; so whose children can he have eaten?&rdquo;
Harasv&aacute;min, being thus completely exonerated, prepared to leave
that city, for his mind was seized with disgust at the slanderous
report got up against him by wicked men. For what pleasure can a wise
man take in a wicked place, the inhabitants of which are wanting in
discrimination? Then the Br&aacute;hmans and merchants, prostrating
themselves at his feet, entreated him to stay there, and he at last,
though with reluctance, consented to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way evil men often impute crime falsely to good men,
allowing their malicious garrulity full play on beholding their
virtuous behaviour. Much more, if they obtain a slight glimpse of any
opportunity for attacking them, do they pour copious showers of oil on
the fire thus kindled. Therefore if you wish, my daughter, to draw the
arrow from my heart, you must not, while this fresh youth of yours is
developing, remain unmarried to please yourself, and so incur the ready
reproach of evil men.&rdquo; Such was the advice which the princess
Kanakarekh&aacute; frequently received from her father the king, but
she, being firmly resolved, again and again answered him:
&ldquo;Therefore quickly search for a Br&aacute;hman or Kshatriya who
has seen that City of Gold and give me to him, for this is the
condition I have named.&rdquo; When the king heard that, reflecting
that his daughter, who remembered her former birth, had completely made
up her mind, and seeing no other way of obtaining for her the husband
she desired, he issued another order to the effect that henceforth the
proclamation by beat of drum was to take place every day in the city,
in order to find out whether any of the newcomers had seen the Golden
City. And once more it was proclaimed in every quarter of the city
every day, after the drum had been beaten,&mdash;&ldquo;If any
Br&aacute;hman or Kshatriya has seen the Golden City, let him speak;
the king will give him his own daughter, together with the rank of
Crown-prince.&rdquo; But no one was found who had obtained a sight of
the Golden City. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"

<p class="first">In the meanwhile the young Br&aacute;hman <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e6017" title=
"Source: &#346;aktivega">&#346;aktideva</span>, in very low spirits,
having been rejected with contempt by the princess he longed for, said
to himself; &ldquo;To-day by asserting falsely that I had seen the
Golden City, I certainly incurred contempt, but I did not obtain that
princess. So I must roam through the earth to find it, until I have
either seen that city or lost my life. For of what use is my life,
unless I can return having seen that city, and obtain the princess as
the prize of the achievement?&rdquo; Having thus taken a vow, that
Br&aacute;hman set out from the city of Vardham&aacute;na, directing
his course toward the southern quarter, and as he journeyed, he at last
reached the great forest of the Vindhya range, and entered it, which
was difficult and long as his own undertaking. And that forest, so to
speak, fanned, with the soft leaves of its trees shaken by the wind,
him, who was heated by the multitudinous rays of the sun; and through
grief at being overrun with many robbers, it made its cry heard day and
night in the shrill screams of animals which were being slain in it by
lions and other noisome beasts. And it seemed, by the unchecked rays of
heat flashed upward from its wild deserts, to endeavour to conquer the
fierce brightness of the sun: in it, though there was no accumulation
of water, calamity was to be easily purchased:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6020src" href="#xd27e6020" name="xd27e6020src">1</a> and its
space seemed ever to extend before the traveller as fast as he crossed
it. In the course of many days he accomplished a long journey through
this forest, and beheld in it a great lake of cold pure water in a
lonely spot: which seemed to lord it over all lakes, with its lotuses
like lofty umbrellas, and its swans like gleaming white
<i>chowries</i>. In the water of that lake he performed the customary
ablutions, and on its northern shore he beheld a hermitage with
beautiful fruit-bearing trees: and he saw an old hermit named
S&uacute;ryatapas sitting at the foot of an A&#347;vattha tree,
surrounded by ascetics, adorned with a rosary, the beads of which by
their number seemed to be the knots that marked the centuries of his
life,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6026src" href="#xd27e6026" name=
"xd27e6026src">2</a> and which rested against the extremity of his ear
that was white with age. And he approached that hermit with a bow, and
the hermit welcomed him with hospitable greetings. And the hermit,
after entertaining him with fruits and other delicacies, asked him,
&ldquo;Whence have you come, and whither are you going? Tell me, good
sir.&rdquo; And &#346;aktideva inclining respectfully, said to that
hermit,&mdash;&ldquo;I have come, venerable sir, from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>city
of Vardham&aacute;na, and I have undertaken to go to the Golden City in
accordance with a vow. But I do not know where that city lies; tell me
venerable sir, if you know.&rdquo; The hermit answered, &ldquo;My son,
I have lived eight hundred years in this hermitage, and I have never
even heard of that city.&rdquo; &#346;aktideva when he heard this from
the hermit, was cast down, and said again&mdash;&ldquo;Then my
wanderings through the earth will end by my dying here.&rdquo; Then
that hermit, having gradually elicited the whole story said to him,
&ldquo;If you are firmly resolved, then do what I tell you. Three
<i>yojanas</i> from here there is a country named K&aacute;mpilya, and
in it is a mountain named Uttara, and on it there is a hermitage. There
dwells my noble elder brother named D&iacute;rghatapas;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6039src" href="#xd27e6039" name="xd27e6039src">3</a>
go to him, he being old may perhaps know of that city.&rdquo; When
&#346;aktideva heard that, hope arose in his breast, and having spent
the night there he quickly set out in the morning from that place. And
wearied with the laborious journey through difficult forest country, he
at last reached that region of K&aacute;mpilya and ascended that
mountain Uttara; and there he beheld that hermit D&iacute;rghatapas in
a hermitage, and he was delighted and approached him with a bow: and
the hermit received him hospitably: and &#346;aktideva said to him,
&ldquo;I am on my way to the City of Gold spoken of by the king&rsquo;s
daughter: but I do not know, venerable sir, where that city is. However
I am bound to find it, so I have been sent to you by the sage
S&uacute;ryatapas in order that I may discover where it lies.&rdquo;
When he had said this, the hermit answered him, &ldquo;Though I am so
old, my son, I have never heard of that city till to-day; I have made
acquaintance with various travellers from foreign lands, and I have
never heard any one speak of it; much less have I seen it. But I am
sure it must be in some distant foreign island, and I can tell you an
expedient to help you in this matter; there is in the midst of the
ocean an island named Utsthala, and in it there is a rich king of the
Nish&aacute;das<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6061src" href="#xd27e6061"
name="xd27e6061src">4</a> named Satyavrata. He goes to and fro among
all the other islands, and he may have seen or heard of that city.
Therefore first go to the city named Vi&#7789;ankapura situated on the
border of the sea. And from that place go with some merchant in a ship
to the island where that Nish&aacute;da dwells, in order that you may
attain your object.&rdquo; When &#346;aktideva heard this from the
hermit, he immediately followed his advice, and taking leave of him set
out from the hermitage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>And after accomplishing many
<i>kos</i> and crossing many lands, he reached the city of
Vi&#7789;ankapura, the ornament of the sea-shore. There he sought out a
merchant named Samudradatta, who traded with the island of Utsthala,
and struck up a friendship with him. And he went on board his ship with
him, and having food for the voyage fully supplied by his kindness, he
set out on the ocean-path. Then, when they had but a short distance to
travel, there arose a black cloud with rumbling thunder, resembling a
roaring R&aacute;kshasa, with flickering lightning to represent his
lolling tongue. And a furious hurricane began to blow like Destiny
herself, whirling up light objects and hurling down heavy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6069src" href="#xd27e6069" name="xd27e6069src">5</a>
And from the sea, lashed by the wind, great waves rose aloft like the
mountains equipped with wings,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6073src"
href="#xd27e6073" name="xd27e6073src">6</a> indignant that their asylum
had been attacked. And that vessel rose on high one moment, and the
next moment plunged below, as if exhibiting how rich men are first
elevated and then cast down. And the next moment that ship, shrilly
laden with the cries of the merchants, burst and split asunder as if
with the weight. And the ship being broken, that merchant its owner
fell into the sea, but floating through it on a plank he at last
reached another vessel. But as &#346;aktideva fell, a large fish,
opening its mouth and neck, swallowed him without injuring any of his
limbs. And as that fish was roaming at will in the midst of the sea, it
happened to pass near the island of Utsthala; and by chance some
servants of that king of the fishermen Satyavrata, who were engaged in
the pursuit of small fish, came there and caught it. And those
fishermen, proud of their prize, immediately dragged it along to shew
to their king, for it was of enormous size. He too, out of curiosity,
seeing that it was of such extraordinary size, ordered his servants to
cut it open; and when it was cut open, &#346;aktideva came out alive
from its belly, having endured a second wonderful imprisonment in the
womb.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6076src" href="#xd27e6076" name=
"xd27e6076src">7</a> Then the fisher-king Satyavrata, when he saw that
young man come out and bestow his blessing on him, was astonished, and
asked him, &ldquo;Who are you, and how did this lot of dwelling in the
belly of the fish befall you? What means this exceedingly strange fate
that you have suffered.&rdquo; When &#346;aktideva heard this, he
answered that king of the fishermen: &ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman of
the name of &#346;aktideva from the city of Vardham&aacute;na;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>and I am bound to visit the City of Gold, and
because I do not know where it is, I have for a long time wandered far
over the earth; then I gathered from a speech of
D&iacute;rghatapas&rsquo; that it was probably in an island, so I set
out to find Satyavrata the king of the fishermen, who lives in the
island of Utsthala, in order to learn its whereabouts, but on the way I
suffered shipwreck, and so having been whelmed in the sea and swallowed
by a fish, I have been brought here now.&rdquo; When &#346;aktideva had
said this, Satyavrata said to him: &ldquo;I am in truth Satyavrata, and
this is the very island you were seeking; but though I have seen many
islands, I have never seen the city you desire to find, but I have
heard of it as situated in one of the distant islands.<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Having said this, and
perceiving that &#346;aktideva was cast down, Satyavrata out of
kindness for his guest went on to say: &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, do not be
despondent; remain here this night, and to-morrow morning I will devise
some expedient to enable you to attain your object.&rdquo; The
Br&aacute;hman was thus consoled by the king, and sent off to a
monastery of Br&aacute;hmans, where guests were readily entertained.
There <span class="corr" id="xd27e6084" title=
"Source: Satyavrata">&#346;aktideva</span> was supplied with food by a
Br&aacute;hman named Vish&#7751;udatta, an inmate of the monastery, and
entered into conversation with him. And in the course of that
conversation, being questioned by him, he told him in a few words his
country, his family, and his whole history. When Vish&#7751;udatta
heard that, he immediately embraced him, and said in a voice indistinct
from the syllables being choked with tears of joy: &ldquo;Bravo! you
are the son of my maternal uncle and a fellow-countryman of mine. But I
long ago in my childhood left that country to come here. So stop here
awhile, and soon the stream of merchants and pilots that come here from
other islands will accomplish your wish.&rdquo; Having told him his
descent in these words, Vish&#7751;udatta waited upon &#346;aktideva
with all becoming attentions. And &#346;aktideva, forgetting the toil
of the journey, obtained delight, for the meeting a relation in a
foreign land is like a fountain of nectar in the desert. And he
considered that the accomplishment of his object was near at hand, for
good luck, befalling one by the way indicates success in an
undertaking. So he reclined at night sleepless upon his bed, with his
mind fixed upon the attainment of his desire, and Vish&#7751;udatta,
who was by his side, in order to encourage and delight him at the same
time, related to him the following tale:</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of A&#347;okadatta and Vijayadatta.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Formerly there was a great Br&aacute;hman named
Govindasv&aacute;min, living on a great royal grant of land on the
banks of the Yamun&aacute;. And in course of time there were born to
that virtuous Br&aacute;hman two sons like himself, A&#347;okadatta and
Vijayadatta. While they were living there, there arose a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>terrible famine in that land, and so
Govindasv&aacute;min said to his wife; &ldquo;This land is ruined by
famine, and I cannot bear to behold the misery of my friends and
relations. For who gives anything to anybody? So let us at any rate
give away to our friends and relations what little food we possess and
leave this country. And let us go with our family to Benares to live
there.&rdquo; When he said this to his wife, she consented, and he gave
away his food, and set out from that place with his wife, sons, and
servants. For men of noble soul cannot bear to witness the miseries of
their relatives. And on the road he beheld a skull-bearing &#346;aiva
ascetic, white with ashes, and with matted hair, like the god &#346;iva
himself with his half-moon. The Br&aacute;hman approached that wise man
with a bow, and out of love for his sons, asked him about their
destiny, whether it should be good or bad, and that Yog&iacute;
answered him: &ldquo;The future destiny of your sons is auspicious, but
you shall be separated, Br&aacute;hman, from this younger one
Vijayadatta, and finally by the might of the second A&#347;okadatta you
shall be reunited to him.&rdquo; Govindasv&aacute;min, when that wise
man said this to him, took leave of him and departed overpowered with
joy, grief, and wonder; and after reaching Benares he spent the day
there in a temple of Durg&aacute; outside the town, engaged in
worshipping the goddess and such like occupations. And in the evening
he encamped outside that temple under a tree, with his family, in the
company of pilgrims who had come from other countries. And at night,
while all were asleep, wearied with their long journey, stretched out
on strewn leaves, and, such other beds as travellers have to put up
with, his younger son Vijayadatta, who was awake, was suddenly seized
with a cold ague-fit; that ague quickly made him tremble, and caused
his hair to stand on end, as if it had been the fear of his approaching
separation from his relations. And oppressed with the cold he woke up
his father, and said to him: &ldquo;A terrible ague afflicts me here
now, father, so bring fuel and light me a fire to keep off the cold, in
no other way can I obtain relief or get through the night.&rdquo; When
Govindasv&aacute;min heard him say this, he was distressed at his
suffering, and said to him; &ldquo;Whence can I procure fire now my
son?&rdquo; Then his son said; &ldquo;Why surely we may see a fire
burning near us on this side, and it is very large, so why should I not
go there and warm my body? So take me by the hand, for I have a
shivering fit, and lead me there.&rdquo; Thus entreated by his son the
Br&aacute;hman went on to say: &ldquo;This is a cemetery,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6102src" href="#xd27e6102" name="xd27e6102src">9</a>
and the fire is that of a funeral pyre, so how can you go to a place
terrible from the presence of goblins and other spirits, for you are
only a child?&rdquo; When the brave Vijayadatta heard that speech of
his affectionate father&rsquo;s, he laughed and said in his confidence,
&ldquo;What can the wretched goblins and other evil ones do to me? Am I
a weakling? So take me there without <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>fear.&rdquo; When he
said this so persistently, his father led him there, and the boy
warming his body approached the pyre, which seemed to bear on itself
the presiding deity of the R&aacute;kshasas in visible form, with the
smoke of the flames for dishevelled hair, devouring the flesh of men.
The boy at once encouraged his father<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6107src" href="#xd27e6107" name="xd27e6107src">10</a> and asked
him what the round thing was that he saw inside the pyre. And his
father standing at his side, answered him, &ldquo;This, my son, is the
skull of a man which is burning in the pyre.&rdquo; Then the boy in his
recklessness struck the skull with a piece of wood lighted at the top,
and clove it. The brains spouted up from it and entered his mouth, like
the initiation into the practices of the R&aacute;kshasas, bestowed
upon him by the funeral flame. And by tasting them that boy became a
R&aacute;kshasa, with hair standing on end, with sword that he had
drawn from the flame, terrible with projecting tusks: so he seized the
skull and drinking the brains from it, he licked it with tongue
restlessly quivering like the flames of fire that clung to the bone.
Then be flung aside the skull, and lifting his sword he attempted to
slay his own father Govindasv&aacute;min. But at that moment a voice
came out from the cemetery, &ldquo;Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6112src" href="#xd27e6112" name=
"xd27e6112src">11</a> thou god, thou oughtest not to slay thy father,
come here.&rdquo; When the boy heard that, having obtained the title of
Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a and become a R&aacute;kshasa, he let his
father alone, and disappeared; and his father departed exclaiming
aloud, &ldquo;Alas my son! Alas my virtuous son! Alas
Vijayadatta!&rdquo; And he returned to the temple of Durg&aacute;; and
in the morning he told his wife and his eldest son A&#347;okadatta what
had taken place. Then that unfortunate man together with them suffered
an attack of the fire of grief, terrible like the falling of lightning
from a cloud, so that the other people, who were sojourning in Benares,
and had come to visit the shrine of the goddess, came up to him and
sympathised heartily with his sorrow. In the meanwhile a great
merchant, who had come to worship the goddess, named Samudradatta,
beheld Govindasv&aacute;min in that state. The good man approached him
and comforted him, and immediately took him and his family home to his
own house. And there he provided him with a bath and other luxuries,
for this is the innate tendency of the great, to have mercy upon the
wretched. Govindasv&aacute;min also and his wife recovered their
self-command, having heard<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6118src" href=
"#xd27e6118" name="xd27e6118src">12</a> the speech of the great
&#346;aiva ascetic, hoping to be re-united to their son. And
thenceforth he lived in that city of Benares, in the house of that rich
merchant, having been asked by him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>to do so. And there his other
son A&#347;okadatta grew up to be a young man, and after studying the
sciences learnt boxing and wrestling. And gradually he attained such
eminence in these arts, that he was not surpassed by any champion on
the earth. And once on a time there was a great gathering of wrestlers
at an idol procession, and a great and famous wrestler came from the
Deccan. He conquered all the other wrestlers of the king of Benares,
who was called Prat&aacute;pamuku&#7789;a, before his eyes. Then the
king had A&#347;okadatta quickly summoned from the house of that
excellent merchant, and ordered him to contend with that wrestler. That
wrestler began the combat by catching the arm of A&#347;okadatta with
his hand, but A&#347;okadatta seized his arm, and hurled him to the
ground. Then the field of combat, as it were, pleased, applauded the
victor with the resounding noise produced by the fall of that champion
wrestler. And the king being gratified, loaded A&#347;okadatta with
jewels, and having seen his might, he made him his own personal
attendant. So he became a favourite of the king&rsquo;s, and in time
attained great prosperity, for to one who possesses heroic qualities, a
king who appreciates merit is a perfect treasure-house. Once on a time,
that king went on the fourteenth day of the month away from his
capital, to worship the god &#346;iva in a splendid temple in a distant
town. After he had paid his devotions, he was returning by night near
the cemetery when he heard this utterance issue from it: &ldquo;O king,
the chief magistrate out of private malice proclaimed that I deserved
death, and it is now the third day since I was impaled, and even now my
life will not leave my body, though I am innocent, so I am exceedingly
thirsty; O king, order water to be given me.&rdquo; When the king heard
it, out of pity he said to his personal attendant A&#347;okadatta,
&ldquo;Send that man some water.&rdquo; Then A&#347;okadatta said,
&ldquo;Who would go there at night? So I had better go myself.&rdquo;
Accordingly he took the water, and set off. After the king had
proceeded on his way to his capital, the hero entered that cemetery,
the interior of which was difficult to penetrate, as it was filled with
dense darkness within; in it there were awful evening oblations offered
with the human flesh scattered about by the jackals; in places the
cemetery was lighted up by the flaming beacons of the blazing funeral
pyres, and in it the Vet&aacute;las made terrible music with the
clapping of their hands, so that it seemed as if it were the palace of
black night. Then he cried aloud, &ldquo;Who asked the king for
water?&rdquo; And he heard from one quarter an answer, &ldquo;I asked
for it.&rdquo; Following the voice he went to a funeral pyre near, and
beheld a man impaled on the top of a stake, and underneath it he saw a
woman that he had never seen before, weeping, adorned with beautiful
ornaments, lovely in every limb; like the night adorned with the rays
of the moon, now that the moon itself had set, its splendour having
waned in the dark fortnight, come to worship the funeral pyre. He asked
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>woman: &ldquo;Who are you, mother, and why are
you standing weeping here?&rdquo; She answered him, &ldquo;I am the
ill-fated wife of him who is here impaled, and I am waiting here with
the firm intention of ascending the funeral pyre with him. And I am
waiting some time for his life to leave his body, for though it is the
third day of his impalement, his breath does not depart. And he often
asks for that water which I have brought here, but I cannot reach his
mouth, my friend, as the stake is high.&rdquo; When he heard that
speech of hers, the mighty hero said to her: &ldquo;But here is water
in my hand sent to him by the king, so place your foot on my back and
lift it to his mouth, for the mere touching of another man in sore need
does not disgrace a woman.&rdquo; When she heard that, she consented,
and taking the water she climbed up so as to plant her two feet on the
back of A&#347;okadatta, who bent down at the foot of the stake. Soon
after, as drops of blood unexpectedly began to fall upon the earth and
on his back, the hero lifted up his face and looked. Then he saw that
woman cutting off slice after slice of that impaled man&rsquo;s flesh
with a knife, and eating it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6131src" href=
"#xd27e6131" name="xd27e6131src">13</a></p>
<p>Then, perceiving that she was some horrible demon,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6139src" href="#xd27e6139" name="xd27e6139src">14</a> he
dragged her down in a rage, and took hold of her by her foot with its
tinkling anklets in order to dash her to pieces on the earth. She, for
her part, dragged away from him that foot, and by her deluding power
quickly flew up into the heaven, and became invisible. And the jewelled
anklet, which had fallen from her foot, while she was dragging it away,
remained in one of A&#347;okadatta&rsquo;s hands. Then he, reflecting
that she had disappeared after shewing herself mild at first, and
evil-working in the middle, and at the end horror-striking by assuming
a terrible form, like association with wicked men,&mdash;and seeing
that heavenly anklet in his hand, was astonished, grieved and delighted
at the same time; and then he left that cemetery, taking the anklet
with him, and went to his own house, and in the morning, after bathing,
to the palace of the king.</p>
<p>And when the king said&mdash;&ldquo;Did you give the water to the
man who was impaled,&rdquo; he said he had done so, and gave him that
anklet; and when the king of his own accord asked him where it came
from, he told that king his wonderful and terrible night-adventure. And
then the king, perceiving that his courage was superior to that of all
men, though he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213"
name="pb213">213</a>]</span>before pleased with his other excellent
qualities, was now more exceedingly delighted; and he took that anklet
in his joy and gave it with his own hand to the queen, and described to
her the way in which he had obtained it. And she, hearing the story and
beholding that heavenly jewelled anklet, rejoiced in her heart and was
continually engaged in extolling A&#347;okadatta. Then the king said to
her: &ldquo;Queen, in birth, in learning, in truthfulness and beauty
A&#347;okadatta is great among the great; and I think it would be a
good thing if he were to become the husband of our lovely daughter
Madanalekh&aacute;; in a bridegroom these qualities are to be looked
for, not fortune that vanishes in a moment, so I will give my daughter
to this excellent hero.&rdquo; When she heard that speech of her
husband&rsquo;s, that queen approving the proposal said, &ldquo;It is
quite fitting, for the youth will be an appropriate match for her, and
her heart has been captivated by him, for she saw him in a
spring-garden, and for some days her mind has been in a state of
vacancy and she neither hears nor sees; I heard of it from her
confidante, and, after spending an anxious night, towards morning I
fell asleep, and I remember I was thus addressed by some heavenly woman
in a dream, &lsquo;My child, thou must not give this thy daughter
Madanalekh&aacute; to any one but A&#347;okadatta, for she is his wife
acquired by him in a former birth.&rsquo; And when I heard it, I woke
up, and in the morning I went myself on the strength of the dream and
consoled my daughter. And now, my husband has of his own accord
proposed the marriage to me. Let her therefore be united to him, as a
spring-creeper to its stalk.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s beloved wife
said this to him, he was pleased, and he made festal rejoicings, and
summoning A&#347;okadatta gave that daughter to him. And the union of
those two, the daughter of the king, and the son of the great
Br&aacute;hman, was such that each enhanced the other&rsquo;s glory,
like the union of prosperity and modesty. And once upon a time the
queen said to the king, with reference to the anklet brought by
A&#347;okadatta: &ldquo;My husband, this anklet by itself does not look
well, so let another be made like it.&rdquo; When the king heard that,
he gave an order to the goldsmiths and other craftsmen of the kind, to
make a second anklet like that. But they, after examining it
said;&mdash;&ldquo;It is impossible, O king, to make another like it,
for the work is heavenly, not human. There are not many jewels of this
kind upon the earth, so let another be sought for where this was
obtained.&rdquo; When the king and the queen heard this, they were
despondent, and A&#347;okadatta who was there, on seeing that,
immediately said, &ldquo;I myself will bring you a fellow to that
anklet.&rdquo; And having made this promise he could not give up the
project on which he was resolved, although the king, terrified at his
temerity, endeavoured to dissuade him out of affection. And taking the
anklet he went again on the fourteenth night of the black fortnight to
the cemetery where he had first obtained it; and after he had entered
that cemetery which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>was full of R&aacute;kshasas as it was of
trees, besmirched with the copious smoke of the funeral pyres, and with
men hanging from their trunks<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6163src" href=
"#xd27e6163" name="xd27e6163src">15</a> which were weighed down and
surrounded with nooses, he did not at first see that woman that he had
seen before, but he thought of an admirable device for obtaining that
bracelet, which was nothing else than the selling of human
flesh.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6168src" href="#xd27e6168" name=
"xd27e6168src">16</a> So he pulled down a corpse from the noose by
which it was suspended on the tree, and he wandered about in the
cemetery, crying aloud&mdash;&ldquo;Human flesh for sale, buy,
buy!&rdquo; And immediately a woman called to him from a distance,
saying, &ldquo;Courageous man, bring the human flesh and come along
with me.&rdquo; When he heard that, he advanced following that woman,
and beheld at no great distance under a tree a lady of heavenly
appearance, surrounded with women, sitting on a throne, glittering with
jewelled ornaments, whom he would never have expected to find in such a
place, any more than to find a lotus in a desert. And having been led
up by that woman, he approached the lady seated as has been described,
and said, &ldquo;Here I am, I sell human flesh, buy, buy!&rdquo; And
then the lady of heavenly appearance said to him, &ldquo;Courageous
hero, for what price will you sell the flesh?&rdquo; Then the hero,
with the corpse hanging over his shoulder and back, said to her,
shewing her at the same time that single jewelled anklet which was in
his hand, &ldquo;I will give this flesh to whoever will give me a
second anklet like this one; if you have got a second like it, take the
flesh.&rdquo; When she heard that, she said to him, &ldquo;I have a
second like it, for this very single anklet was taken by you from me. I
am that very woman who was seen by you near the impaled man, but you do
not recognise me now, because I have assumed another shape. So what is
the use of flesh? If you do what I tell you, I will give you my second
anklet, which matches the one in your hand.&rdquo; When she said this
to the hero, he consented and said, &ldquo;I will immediately do
whatever you say.&rdquo; Then she told him her whole desire from the
beginning: &ldquo;There is, good sir, a city named Trighan&#7789;a on a
peak of the Him&aacute;layas. In it there lived a heroic prince of the
R&aacute;kshasas named Lambajihva. I am his wife, Vidyuchchhikh&aacute;
by name, and I can change my form at will. And as fate would have it,
that husband of mine, after the birth of my daughter, was slain in
battle fighting in front of the king Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a; then
that king being pleased gave me his own city, and I have lived with my
daughter in great comfort on its proceeds up to the present time. And
that daughter of mine has by this time grown up to fresh womanhood, and
I have great anxiety in my mind as to how to obtain for her a brave
husband. Then being here on the fourteenth night of the lunar
fortnight, and seeing you coming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215"
href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>along this way with the king,
I thought&mdash;&lsquo;This good-looking youth is a hero and a fit
match for my daughter. So why should I not devise some stratagem for
obtaining him?&rsquo; Thus I determined, and imitating the voice of an
impaled person, I asked for water, and brought you into the middle of
that cemetery by a trick. And there I exhibited my delusive power in
assuming a false shape and other characteristics, and saying what was
false I imposed upon you there, though only for a moment. And I
artfully left one of my anklets there to attract you again, like a
binding chain to draw you, and then I came away. And to-day I have
obtained you by that very expedient, so come to my house; marry my
daughter and receive the other anklet.&rdquo; When the
R&aacute;kshas&iacute; said this to him, the hero consented, and by
means of her magic power he went with her through the air to her city.
And he saw that city built of gold on a peak of the Him&aacute;layas,
like the orb of the sun fixed in one spot, being weary with the toil of
wandering through the heavens. There he married that daughter of the
prince of the R&aacute;kshasas, by name Vidyutprabh&aacute;, like the
success of his own daring incarnate in bodily form. And A&#347;okadatta
dwelt with that loved one some time in that city, enjoying great
comfort by means of his mother-in-law&rsquo;s wealth. Then he said to
his mother-in-law, &ldquo;Give me that anklet, for I must now go to the
city of Benares, for I myself long ago promised the king that I would
bring a second anklet, that would vie with the first one so
distinguished for its unparalleled beauty.&rdquo; The mother-in-law,
having been thus entreated by her son-in-law, gave him that second
anklet of hers, and in addition a golden lotus.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6182src" href="#xd27e6182" name="xd27e6182src">17</a></p>
<p>Then he left that city with the anklet and the lotus, after
promising to return, and his mother-in-law by the power of her magic
knowledge carried him once more through the air to the cemetery. And
then she stopped under the tree and said to him, &ldquo;I always come
here on the fourteenth night of the black fortnight, and whenever you
come here on that<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6190src" href="#xd27e6190"
name="xd27e6190src">18</a> night, you will find me here under the
banyan-tree.&rdquo; When A&#347;okadatta heard this, he agreed to come
there on that night, and took leave of that R&aacute;kshas&iacute;, and
went first to his father&rsquo;s house. And just as he was gladdening
by his unexpected arrival his parents, who were grieved by such an
absence of his, which doubled their grief for their separation from
their younger son, the king his father-in-law, who had heard of his
arrival, came in. The king indulged in a long outburst of joy,
embracing him who bent before him, with limbs the hairs of which stood
on end like thorns, as if terrified at touching one so daring.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6199src" href="#xd27e6199" name=
"xd27e6199src">19</a> Then A&#347;okadatta entered with him the palace
of the king, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>like joy incarnate in bodily form, and he gave
to the king those two anklets matched together, which so to speak
praised his valour with their tinkling, and he bestowed on that king
the beautiful golden lotus, as it were the lotus, with which the
presiding Fortune of the R&aacute;kshasas&rsquo; treasure plays, torn,
from her hand; then being questioned out of curiosity by the king and
queen he told the story of his exploits, which poured nectar into their
ears. The king then exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Is glittering glory, which
astonishes the mind by the description of wonderful exploits, ever
obtained without a man&rsquo;s bringing himself to display
boldness?&rdquo; Thus the king spake on that occasion, and he and the
queen, who had obtained the pair of anklets, considered their object in
life attained, now that they had such a son-in-law. And then that
palace, resounding with festal instruments, appeared as if it were
chanting the virtues of A&#347;okadatta. And on the next day the king
dedicated the golden lotus in a temple made by himself, placing it upon
a beautiful silver vessel; and the two together, the vessel and the
lotus, gleamed white and red like the glory of the king and the
might<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6204src" href="#xd27e6204" name=
"xd27e6204src">20</a> of A&#347;okadatta. And beholding them thus, the
king, a devout worshipper of &#346;iva, with eyes expanded with joy,
spoke inspired with the rapture of adoration, &ldquo;Ah! this lofty
vessel appears, with this lotus upon it, like &#346;iva white with
ashes, with his auburn matted locks. If I had a second golden lotus
like it, I would place it in this second silver vessel.&rdquo; When
A&#347;okadatta heard this speech of the king&rsquo;s, he said,
&ldquo;I, king, will bring you a second golden lotus;&rdquo; when the
king heard that, he answered him, &ldquo;I have no need of another
lotus, a truce to your temerity!&rdquo; Then as days went on,
A&#347;okadatta being desirous of bringing a golden lotus, the
fourteenth day of the black fortnight returned; and that evening the
sun, the golden lotus of the sky-lake, went to the mountain of setting,
as if out of fear, knowing his desire for a golden lotus; and when the
shades of night, brown as smoke, began immediately to spread everywhere
like R&aacute;kshasas, proud of having swallowed the red clouds of
evening as if they were raw flesh, and the mouth of night, like that of
an awful female goblin, began to yawn, shining and terrible as
<i>tam&aacute;la</i>, full of flickering flames,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6211src" href="#xd27e6211" name="xd27e6211src">21</a>
A&#347;okadatta of his own accord left the palace where the princess
was asleep, and again went to that cemetery. There he beheld at the
foot of that banyan-tree his mother-in-law the R&aacute;kshas&iacute;,
who had again come, and who received him with a courteous welcome, and
with her the youth went again to her home, the peak of the
Him&aacute;layas, where his wife was anxiously awaiting him. And after
he had remained some time with his wife, he said to his mother-in-law,
&ldquo;Give me a second golden lotus from somewhere or other.&rdquo;
When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>she heard that, she said to him, &ldquo;Whence
can I procure another golden lotus? But there is a lake here belonging
to our king Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a, where golden lotuses of this
kind grow on all sides. From that lake he gave that one lotus to my
husband as a token of affection.&rdquo; When she said this, he answered
her, &ldquo;Then take me to that lake, in order that I may myself take
a golden lotus from it.&rdquo; She then attempted to dissuade him
saying, &ldquo;It is impossible; for the lake is guarded by terrible
R&aacute;kshasas;&rdquo; but nevertheless he would not desist from his
importunity.<a id="xd27e6219" name="xd27e6219"></a> Then at last his
mother-in-law was with much difficulty induced to take him there, and
he beheld from afar that heavenly lake on the plateau of a lofty
mountain, covered with dense and tall-stalked lotuses of gleaming gold,
as if from continually facing the sun&rsquo;s rays they had drunk them
in, and so become interpenetrated with them.</p>
<p>So he went there and began to gather the lotuses, and while he was
thus engaged, the terrible R&aacute;kshasas, who guarded it,
endeavoured to prevent him from doing so. And being armed he killed
some of them, but the others fled and told their king
Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6223src" href=
"#xd27e6223" name="xd27e6223src">22</a> and when that king of the
R&aacute;kshasas heard of it, he was enraged and came there himself,
and saw A&#347;okadatta with the lotuses he had carried off. And in his
astonishment he exclaimed as he recognised his brother: &ldquo;What! is
this my brother A&#347;okadatta come here?&rdquo; Then he flung away
his weapon, and with his eyes washed with tears of joy, he quickly ran
and fell at his feet, and said to him: &ldquo;I am Vijayadatta, your
younger brother, we are both the sons of that excellent Br&aacute;hman
Govindasv&aacute;min. And by the appointment of destiny, I became a
R&aacute;kshasa such as you see, and have continued such for this long
time, and I am called Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a from my cleaving the
skull on the funeral pyre.<a id="xd27e6231" name="xd27e6231"></a></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd27e6234" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>But now from seeing you I have remembered
my former Br&aacute;hman nature, and that R&aacute;kshasa nature of
mine, that clouded my mind with delusion, has left me.&rdquo; When
Vijayadatta said this, A&#347;okadatta embraced him, and so to speak,
washed with copious tears of joy his body defiled by the
R&aacute;kshasa nature. And while he was thus engaged, there descended
from heaven by divine command the spiritual guide of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Kau&#347;ika. And he approaching these two
brothers, said, &ldquo;You and your family are all Vidy&aacute;dharas,
who have been reduced to this state by a curse, and now the curse of
all of you has terminated. So receive these sciences, which belong to
you, and which you must share with your relations. And return to your
own proper dwelling taking with you your relations.&rdquo; Having said
this, the spiritual guide, after bestowing the sciences on them,
ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>And they, having become Vidy&aacute;dharas, awoke from their long
dream, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>and went through the air to that peak of the
Him&aacute;layas, taking with them the golden lotuses, and there
A&#347;okadatta repaired to his wife the daughter of the king of the
R&aacute;kshasas, and then her curse came to an end, and she became a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;. And those two brothers went in a moment with
that fair-eyed one to Benares, travelling through the air. And there
they visited their parents, who were scorched with the fire of
separation, and refreshed them by pouring upon them the revivifying
nectar of their own appearance. And those two, who, without changing
the body, had gone through such wonderful transformations, produced joy
not only in their parents, but in the people at large. And when
Vijayadatta&rsquo;s father, after so long a separation, folded him in a
close embrace, he filled full not only his arms, but also his desire.
Then the king Prat&aacute;pamuku&#7789;a, the father-in-law of
A&#347;okadatta, hearing of it, came there in high delight; and
A&#347;okadatta, being kindly received by the king, entered with his
relations the king&rsquo;s palace, in which his beloved was anxiously
awaiting him, and which was in a state of festal rejoicing. And he gave
many golden lotuses to that king, and the king was delighted at getting
more than he had asked for. Then Vijayadatta&rsquo;s father
Govindasv&aacute;min, full of wonder and curiosity, said to him in the
presence of all: &ldquo;Tell me, my son, what sort of adventures you
had, after you had become a R&aacute;kshasa in the cemetery during the
night.&rdquo; Then Vijayadatta said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My father, when
in my reckless frivolity I had cloven the burning skull on the funeral
pyre, as fate would have it, I immediately, as you saw, became a
R&aacute;kshasa by its brains having entered my mouth, being bewildered
with delusion. Then I was summoned by the other R&aacute;kshasas, who
gave me the name of Kap&aacute;laspho&#7789;a, and I joined them. And
then I was led by them to their sovereign the king of the
R&aacute;kshasas, and he, when he saw me, was pleased with me and
appointed me commander-in-chief. And once on a time that king of the
R&aacute;kshasas went in his infatuation to attack the Gandharvas, and
was there slain in battle by his foes. And then his subjects accepted
my rule, so I dwelt in his city and ruled those R&aacute;kshasas, and
while I was there, I suddenly beheld that elder brother of mine
A&#347;okadatta, who had come for golden lotuses, and the sight of him
put a stop to that R&aacute;kshasa nature in me. What follows, how we
were released from the power of the curse, and thereby recovered our
sciences,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6241src" href="#xd27e6241" name=
"xd27e6241src">23</a> all this my elder brother will relate to
you.&rdquo; When Vijayadatta had told this story, A&#347;okadatta began
to tell his from the beginning: &ldquo;Long ago we were
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and from the heaven we beheld the daughters of the
hermits bathing in the Ganges near the hermitage of
G&aacute;lava,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6244src" href="#xd27e6244"
name="xd27e6244src">24</a> and then we fell suddenly in love with them,
and they returned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"
name="pb219">219</a>]</span>our affection; all this took place in
secret, but their relations, who possessed heavenly insight, found it
out and cursed us in their anger: &lsquo;May you two wicked ones be
born both of you to a mortal woman, and then you shall be separated in
a marvellous manner, but when the second of you shall behold the first
arrived in a distant land, inaccessible to man, and shall recognise
him, then you shall have your magic knowledge restored to you by the
spiritual preceptor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and you shall again
become Vidy&aacute;dharas, released from the curse and re-united to
your friends.&rsquo; Having been cursed in this way by those hermits,
we were both born here in this land, and you know the whole story of
our separation, and now by going to the city of the king of the
R&aacute;kshasas, by virtue of my mother-in-law&rsquo;s magic power, to
fetch the golden lotuses, I have found this younger brother of mine.
And in that very place we obtained the sciences from our preceptor
Prajnaptikau&#347;ika, and suddenly becoming Vidy&aacute;dharas we have
quickly arrived here.&rdquo; Thus A&#347;okadatta spoke, and then that
hero of various adventures, delighted at having escaped the darkness of
the curse, bestowed on his parents and his beloved, the daughter of the
king, his own wonderful sciences of many kinds, so that their minds
were suddenly awakened, and they became Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then the
happy hero took leave of the king, and with his brother, his parents,
and his two wives, flew up, and quickly reached through the air the
palace of his emperor. There he beheld him, and received his orders,
and so did his brother, and he bore henceforth the name of
A&#347;okavega, and his brother of Vijayavega. And both the brothers,
having become noble Vidy&aacute;dhara youths, went, accompanied by
their relations, to the splendid mountain named
Govindak&uacute;&#7789;a, which now became their home. And
Prat&aacute;pamuku&#7789;a the king of Benares, overpowered by wonder,
placed one of the golden lotuses in the second vessel in his temple,
and offered to &#346;iva the other golden lotuses presented by
A&#347;okadatta, and delighted with the honour of his connexion,
considered his family highly fortunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus divine persons become incarnate for some reason, and are
born in this world of men, and possessing their native virtue and
courage, attain successes which it is hard to win. So I am persuaded
that you, O sea of courage, are some portion of a divinity, and will
attain success as you desire; daring in achievements hard to accomplish
even by the great, generally indicates a surpassingly excellent nature.
Moreover the princess Kanakarekh&aacute;, whom you love, must surely be
a heavenly being, otherwise being a mere child how could she desire a
husband that has seen the Golden City?&rdquo; Having heard in secret
this long and interesting story from Vish&#7751;udatta, &#346;aktideva
desiring in his heart to behold the Golden City, and supporting himself
with resolute patience, managed to get through the night. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning, while &#346;aktideva was dwelling in
the monastery in the island of Utsthala, Satyavrata, the king of the
fishermen, came to him, and said to him in accordance with the promise
which he had made before, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I have thought of a
device for accomplishing your wish; there is a fair isle in the middle
of the sea named Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a, and in it there is a temple of
the adorable Vish&#7751;u founded by the Ocean, and on the twelfth day
of the white fortnight of <span class="corr" id="xd27e6261" title=
"Source: &Aacute;sh&#803;&aacute;&#7693;ha">&Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;ha</span>
there is a festival there with a procession, and people come there
diligently from all the islands to offer worship. It is possible that
some one there might know about the Golden City, so come let us go
there, for that day is near.&rdquo; When Satyavrata made this proposal,
&#346;aktideva consented gladly, and took with him the provisions for
the journey furnished by Vish&#7751;udatta. Then he went on board the
ship brought by Satyavrata, and quickly set out with him on the
ocean-path, and as he was going with Satyavrata on the home of
marvels<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6264src" href="#xd27e6264" name=
"xd27e6264src">1</a> in which the monsters resembled islands, he asked
the king, who was steering the ship, &ldquo;What is this enormous
object which is seen in the sea far off in this direction, looking like
a huge mountain equipped with wings rising at will out of the
sea?&rdquo; Then Satyavrata said: &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, this is a
banyan-tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6269src" href="#xd27e6269"
name="xd27e6269src">2</a> underneath it they say that there is a
gigantic whirlpool, the mouth of the submarine fire. And we must take
care in passing this way to avoid that spot, for those who once enter
that whirlpool never return again.&rdquo; While Satyavrata was thus
speaking, the ship began to be carried in that very direction by the
force of the wind;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6280src" href=
"#xd27e6280" name="xd27e6280src">3</a> when Satyavrata saw this, he
again said to &#346;aktideva: &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, it is clear that
the time of our destruction has now arrived, for see, this ship
suddenly drifts<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6286src" href="#xd27e6286"
name="xd27e6286src">4</a> in that direction. And now I cannot anyhow
prevent it, so we are certain to be cast into that deep whirlpool, as
into the mouth of death, by the sea which draws us on as if it were
mighty fate, the result of our deeds. And it grieves me not for myself,
for whose body is continuing? But it grieves me to think that your
desire has not been accomplished in spite of all your toils, so while I
keep back this ship for a moment, quickly climb on to the boughs of
this banyan-tree, perhaps some expedient may present itself for saving
the life of one of such noble form, for who can calculate the caprices
of fate or the waves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>of the sea?&rdquo; While the heroic
Satyavrata was saying this, the ship drew near the tree; at that moment
&#346;aktideva made a leap in his terror, and caught a broad branch of
that marine banyan-tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6295src" href=
"#xd27e6295" name="xd27e6295src">5</a> but Satyavrata&rsquo;s body and
ship, which he offered for another, were swept down into the whirlpool,
and he entered the mouth of the submarine fire. But &#346;aktideva,
though he had escaped to the bough of that tree, which filled the
regions with its branches, was full of despair and
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I have not beheld that Golden City, and I am
perishing in an uninhabited place, moreover I have also brought about
the death of that king of the fishermen. Or rather who can resist the
awful goddess of Destiny, that ever places her foot upon the heads of
all men?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd27e6326src"
href="#xd27e6326" name="xd27e6326src">6</a> While the Br&aacute;hman
youth was thus revolving thoughts suited to the occasion on the trunk
of the tree, the day came to an end. And in the evening he saw many
enormous birds, of the nature of vultures, coming into that banyan-tree
from all quarters, filling the sides of heaven with their cries, and
the waves of the sea, that was lashed by the wind of their broad wings,
appeared as if running to meet them out of affection produced by long
acquaintance.</p>
<p>Then he, concealed by the dense leaves, overheard the conversation
of those birds perched on the branches, which was carried on in human
language. One described some distant island, another a mountain,
another a distant region as the place where he had gone to roam during
the day, but an old bird among them said, &ldquo;I went to-day to the
Golden City to disport myself, and to-morrow morning I shall go there
again to feed at my ease, for what is the use of my taking a long and
fatiguing journey?&rdquo; &#346;aktideva&rsquo;s sorrow was removed by
that speech of the bird&rsquo;s, which resembled a sudden shower of
nectar, and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Bravo! that city does exist,
and now I have an instrument for reaching it, this gigantic bird given
me as a means of conveyance.&rdquo; Thinking thus, &#346;aktideva
slowly advanced and hid himself among the back-feathers of that bird
while it was asleep, and next morning, when the other birds went off in
different directions, that vulture exhibiting a strange partiality to
the Br&aacute;hman like destiny,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6338src"
href="#xd27e6338" name="xd27e6338src">7</a> carrying &#346;aktideva
unseen on his back where he had climbed up, went immediately to the
Golden City to feed again.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6343src" href=
"#xd27e6343" name="xd27e6343src">8</a> Then the bird alighted in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>a garden, and &#346;aktideva got down from its
back unobserved and left it, but while he was roaming about there, he
saw two women engaged in gathering flowers; he approached them slowly,
who were astonished at his appearance, and he asked them, &ldquo;What
place is this, good ladies, and who are you?&rdquo; And they said to
him: &ldquo;Friend, this is a city called the Golden City, a seat of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and in it there dwells a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, named Chandraprabh&aacute;, and know that we
are the gardeners in her garden, and we are gathering these flowers for
her.&rdquo; Then the Br&aacute;hman said; &ldquo;Obtain for me an
interview with your mistress here.&rdquo; When they heard this, they
consented, and the two women conducted the young man to the palace in
their city. When he reached it, he saw that it was glittering with
pillars of precious stones, and had walls of gold,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6353src" href="#xd27e6353" name="xd27e6353src">9</a> as it
were the very <i>rendezvous</i> of prosperity. And all the attendants,
when they saw him arrived there, went and told Chandraprabh&aacute; the
marvellous tidings of the arrival of a mortal; then she gave a command
to the warder, and immediately had the Br&aacute;hman brought into the
palace and conducted into her presence; when he entered, he beheld her
there giving a feast to his eyes, like the Creator&rsquo;s ability to
create marvels, represented in bodily form. And she rose from her
jewelled couch, while he was still far off, and honoured him with a
welcome herself, overpowered by beholding him. And when he had taken a
seat, she asked him, &ldquo;Auspicious sir, who are you, that have come
here in such guise, and how did you reach this land inaccessible to
men?&rdquo; When Chandraprabh&aacute; in her curiosity asked him this
question, &#346;aktideva told her his country and his birth and his
name, and he related to her how he had come in order to obtain the
princess Kanakarekh&aacute; as the reward of beholding the Golden City.
When Chandraprabh&aacute; heard that, she thought a little and heaved a
deep sigh, and said to &#346;aktideva in private; &ldquo;Listen, I am
now about to tell you something, fortunate sir. There is in this land a
king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named &#346;a&#347;ikha&#7751;&#7693;a,
and we four daughters were born to him in due course; I am the eldest
Chandraprabh&aacute;, and the next is Chandrarekh&aacute;, and the
third is &#346;a&#347;irekh&aacute; and the fourth
&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;. We gradually grew up to womanhood in our
father&rsquo;s house, and once upon a time those three sisters of mine
went together to the shore of the Ganges to bathe, while I was detained
at home by illness; then they began to play in the water, and in the
insolence of youth they sprinkled with water a hermit named Agryatapas,
while he was in the stream. That hermit in his wrath cursed those
girls, who had carried their merriment too far,
saying:&mdash;&ldquo;You wicked maidens, be born all of you in the
world of mortals.&rdquo; When our father heard that, he went and
pacified the great hermit, and the hermit told how the curse of each of
them severally should end, and appointed to each of them in her mortal
condition the power of remembering her former existence, supplemented
with divine insight. Then, they having left their bodies and gone
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>to the world of men, my father bestowed on me
this city, and in his grief went to the forest, but while I was
dwelling here, the goddess Durg&aacute; informed me in a dream that a
mortal should become my husband. For this reason, though my father has
recommended to me many Vidy&aacute;dhara suitors, I have rejected them
all and remained unmarried up to this day. But now I am subdued by your
wonderful arrival and by your handsome form, and I give myself to you;
so I will go on the approaching fourteenth day of the lunar fortnight
to the great mountain called &#7770;ishabha to entreat my father for
your sake, for all the most excellent Vidy&aacute;dharas assemble there
from all quarters on that day to worship the god &#346;iva, and my
father comes there too, and after I have obtained his permission, I
will return here quickly; then marry me. Now rise up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, Chandraprabh&aacute; supplied &#346;aktideva with
various kinds of luxuries suited to Vidy&aacute;dharas, and while he
remained there, he was as much refreshed, as one heated by a forest
conflagration would be by bathing in a lake of nectar. And when the
fourteenth day had arrived, Chandraprabh&aacute; said to him:
&ldquo;To-day I go to entreat my father&rsquo;s permission to marry
you, and all my attendants will go with me. But you must not be grieved
at being left alone for two days, moreover, while you remain alone in
this palace, you must by no means ascend the middle terrace.&rdquo;
When Chandraprabh&aacute; had said this to that young Br&aacute;hman,
she set out on her journey leaving her heart with him, and escorted on
her way by his. And &#346;aktideva, remaining there alone, wandered
from one magnificent part of the palace to another, to delight his
mind; and then he felt a curiosity to know why that daughter of the
Vidy&aacute;dhara had forbidden him to ascend the roof of the palace,
and so he ascended that middle terrace of the palace, for men are
generally inclined to do that which is forbidden: and when he had
ascended it, he saw three concealed pavilions, and he entered one of
them, the door of which was open, and when he had entered it he saw a
certain woman lying on a magnificently jewelled sofa, on which there
was a mattress placed, whose body was hidden by a sheet. But when he
lifted up the sheet and looked, he beheld lying dead in that guise that
beautiful maiden, the daughter of king Paropak&aacute;rin; and when he
saw her there, he thought, &ldquo;What is this great wonder? Is she
sleeping a sleep from which there is no awaking, or is it a complete
delusion on my part? That woman, for whose sake I have travelled to
this foreign land, is lying here without breath, though she is alive in
my own country, and she still retains her beauty unimpaired, so I may
be certain that this is all a magic show, which the Creator for some
reason or other exhibits to beguile me.&rdquo; Thinking thus, he
proceeded to enter in succession those other two pavilions, and he
beheld within them in the same way two other maidens; then he went in
his astonishment out of the palace, and sitting down he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>remained looking at a very beautiful lake below
it, and on its bank he beheld a horse with a jewelled saddle; so he
descended immediately from where he was, and out of curiosity
approached its side; and seeing that it had no rider on it, he tried to
mount it, and that horse struck him with its heel and flung him into
the lake. And after he had sunk beneath the surface of the lake, he
quickly rose up to his astonishment from the middle of a garden-lake in
his own city of Vardham&aacute;na; and he saw himself suddenly standing
in the water of a lake in his own native city, like the <i lang=
"sa-latn">kumuda</i> plants, miserable without the light of the
moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6372src" href="#xd27e6372" name=
"xd27e6372src">10</a> He reflected &ldquo;How different is this city of
Vardham&aacute;na from that city of the Vidy&aacute;dharas! Alas! what
is this great display of marvellous delusion? Alas! I, ill-fated
wretch, am wonderfully deceived by some strange power; or rather, who
on this earth knows what is the nature of destiny?&rdquo; Thus
reflecting &#346;aktideva rose from the midst of the lake, and went in
a state of wonder to his own father&rsquo;s house. There he made a
false representation, giving as an excuse for his absence that he had
been himself going about with a drum, and being gladly welcomed by his
father he remained with his delighted relations; and on the second day
he went outside his house, and heard again these words being proclaimed
in the city by beat of drum,&mdash;&ldquo;Let whoever, being a
Br&aacute;hman or a Kshatriya, has really seen the Golden City, say so:
the king will give him his daughter, and make him crown-prince.&rdquo;
Then &#346;aktideva hearing that, having successfully accomplished the
task, again went and said to those who were proclaiming this by beat of
drum,&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen that city.&rdquo; And they took him
before that king, and the king recognising him, supposed that he was
again saying what was untrue, as he had done before. But he
said&mdash;&ldquo;If I say what is false, and if I have not really seen
that city, I desire now to be punished with death; let the princess
herself examine me.&rdquo; When he said this, the king went and had his
daughter summoned by his servants. She, when she saw that
Br&aacute;hman, whom she had seen before, again said to the king;
&ldquo;My father, he will tell us some falsehood again.&rdquo; Then
&#346;aktideva said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;Princess, whether I speak
truly or falsely, be pleased to explain this point which excites my
curiosity. How is it that I saw you lying <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>dead on a sofa in the
golden city, and yet see you here alive?&rdquo; When the princess
Kanakarekh&aacute; had been asked this question by &#346;aktideva, and
furnished with this token of his truth, she said in the presence of her
father: &ldquo;It is true that this great-hearted one has seen that
city, and in a short time he will be my husband, when I return to dwell
there. And there he will marry my other three sisters; and he will
govern as king the Vidy&aacute;dharas in that city. But I must to-day
enter my own body and that city, for I have been born here in your
house owing to the curse of a hermit, who moreover appointed that my
curse should end in the following way, &lsquo;When you shall be wearing
a human form, and a man, having beheld your body in the Golden City,
shall reveal the truth, then you shall be freed from your curse, and
that man shall become your husband.&rsquo; And though I am in a human
body I remember my origin, and I possess supernatural knowledge, so I
will now depart to my own Vidy&aacute;dhara home, to a happy
fortune.&rdquo; Saying this the princess left her body, and vanished,
and a confused cry arose in the palace. And &#346;aktideva, who had now
lost both the maidens, thinking over the two beloved ones whom he had
gained by various difficult toils, and who yet were not gained, and not
only grieved but blaming himself, with his desires not accomplished,
left the king&rsquo;s palace and in a moment went through the following
train of thought: &ldquo;Kanakarekh&aacute; said that I should attain
my desire; so why do I despond, for success depends upon courage? I
will again go to the Golden City by the same path, and destiny will
without doubt again provide me with a means of getting there.&rdquo;
Thus reflecting <span class="corr" id="xd27e6389" title=
"Source: &#346;akt&iacute;deva">&#346;aktideva</span> set out from that
city, for resolute men who have once undertaken a project do not turn
back without accomplishing their object. And journeying on, he again
reached after a long time that city named Vi&#7789;ankapura, situated
on the shore of the sea. And there he saw the merchant coming to meet
him, with whom he originally went to sea, and whose ship was wrecked
there. He thought, &ldquo;Can this be Samudradatta, and how can he have
escaped after falling into the sea? But how can it be otherwise? I
myself am a strange illustration of its possibility.&rdquo; While he
approached the merchant thinking thus, the merchant recognised him, and
embraced him in his delight, and he took him to his own house and after
entertaining him, asked him&mdash;&ldquo;When the ship foundered, how
did you escape from the sea?&rdquo; &#346;aktideva then told him his
whole history, how, after being swallowed by a fish, he first reached
the island of Utsthala, and then he asked the good merchant in his
turn: &ldquo;Tell me also how you escaped from the sea.&rdquo; Then the
merchant said, &ldquo;After I fell into the sea that time, I remained
floating for three days supported on a plank. Then a ship suddenly came
that way, and I, crying out, was descried by those in her, and taken on
board her. And when I got on board, I saw my own father who had gone to
a distant island long before, and was now returning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>after a long absence. My father, when he saw me,
recognised me, and embracing me asked my story with tears, and I told
it him as follows&mdash;&lsquo;My father, you had been away for a long
time and had not returned, and so I set about trading myself, thinking
it was my proper employment; then on my way to a distant island my ship
was wrecked, and I was plunged in the sea, and you have found me and
rescued me.&rsquo; When I had said this to him, my father asked me
reproachfully&mdash;&lsquo;Why do you run such risks? For I possess
wealth, my son, and I am engaged in acquiring it, see, I have brought
you back this ship full of gold.&rsquo; Thus spoke my father to me, and
comforting me took me home in that very ship to my own dwelling in
Vi&#7789;ankapura.&rdquo; When &#346;aktideva had heard this account
from the merchant, and had rested that night, he said to him on the
next day&mdash;&ldquo;Great merchant, I must once more go to the island
of Utsthala, so tell me how I can get there now.&rdquo; The merchant
said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Some agents of mine are preparing to go there
to-day, so go on board the ship, and set out with them.&rdquo;
Thereupon the Br&aacute;hman set out with the merchant&rsquo;s agents
to go to that island of Utsthala, and by chance the sons of the king of
the fishermen saw him there, and when they were near him, they
recognised him and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, you went with our
father to search here and there for the Golden City, and how is it that
you have come back here to-day alone?&rdquo; Then &#346;aktideva said,
&ldquo;Your father, when out at sea, fell into the mouth of the
submarine fire, his ship having been dragged down by the
current.&rdquo; When those sons of the fisher-king heard that, they
were angry and said to their servants&mdash;&ldquo;Bind this wicked
man, for he has murdered our father. Otherwise how could it have
happened that, when two men were in the same ship, one should have
fallen into the mouth of the submarine fire, and the other escaped it.
So we must to-morrow morning sacrifice our father&rsquo;s murderer in
front of the goddess Durg&aacute;, treating him as a victim.&rdquo;
Having said this to their servants, those sons of the fisher-king bound
&#346;aktideva, and took him off to the awful temple of Durg&aacute;,
the belly of which was enlarged, as if it continually swallowed many
lives, and which was like the mouth of death devouring
<i>tam&aacute;la</i> with projecting teeth. There &#346;aktideva
remained bound during the night in fear for his life, and he thus
prayed to the goddess Durg&aacute;,&mdash;&ldquo;Adorable one, granter
of boons, thou didst deliver the world with thy form which was like the
orb of the rising sun, appearing as if it had drunk its fill of the
blood gushing freely from the throat of the giant Ruru;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6398src" href="#xd27e6398" name=
"xd27e6398src">11</a> therefore deliver me, thy constant votary, who
have come a long distance out of desire to obtain my beloved, but am
now fallen without cause into the power of my enemies.&rdquo; Thus he
prayed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>the goddess, and with difficulty went off to
sleep, and in the night he saw a woman come out of the inner cell of
the temple; that woman of heavenly beauty came up to him, and said with
a compassionate manner, &ldquo;Do not fear, &#346;aktideva, no harm
shall happen to you. The sons of that fisher-king have a sister named
Vindumat&iacute;, that maiden shall see you in the morning and claim
you for a husband, and you must agree to that, she will bring about
your deliverance: and she is not of the fisher-caste: for she is a
celestial female degraded in consequence of a curse.&rdquo; When he
heard this, he woke up, and in the morning that fisher-maiden came to
the temple, a shower of nectar to his eyes. And announcing herself, she
came up to him and said in her eagerness, &ldquo;I will have you
released from this prison, therefore do what I desire. For I have
refused all these suitors approved of by my brothers, but the moment I
saw you, love arose in my soul, therefore marry me.&rdquo; When
Vindumat&iacute;, the daughter of the fisher-king, said this to him,
&#346;aktideva remembering his dream, accepted her proposal gladly; she
procured his release, and he married that fair one, whose wish was
gratified by her brothers receiving the command to do so from
Durg&aacute; in a dream. And he lived there with that heavenly creature
that had assumed a human form, obtained solely by his merits in a
former life, as if with happy success. And one day, as he was standing
upon the roof of his palace, he saw a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la
coming along with a load of cow&rsquo;s flesh, and he said to his
beloved&mdash;&ldquo;Look, slender one! how can this evildoer eat the
flesh of cows, those animals that are the object of veneration to the
three worlds?&rdquo; Then Vindumat&iacute;, hearing that, said to her
husband; &ldquo;The wickedness of this act is inconceivable, what can
we say in palliation of it. I have been born in this race of fishermen
for a very small offence owing to the might of cows, but what can atone
for this man&rsquo;s sin?&rdquo; When she said this, &#346;aktideva
said to her;&mdash;&ldquo;That is wonderful: tell me, my beloved, who
you are, and how you came to be born in a family of fishermen.&rdquo;
When he asked this with much importunity, she said to him, &ldquo;I
will tell you, though it is a secret, if you promise to do what I ask
you.&rdquo; He affirmed with an oath; &ldquo;Yes, I will do what you
ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then told him first what she desired him to do; &ldquo;In this
island you will soon marry another wife, and she, my husband, will soon
became pregnant, and in the eighth month of her pregnancy you must cut
her open and take out the child, and you must feel no compunction about
it.&rdquo; Thus she said, and he was astonished, exclaiming,
&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; and he was full of horror, but that
daughter of the fisher-king went on to say, &ldquo;This request of mine
you must perform for a certain reason; now hear who I am, and how I
came to be born in a family of fishermen. Long ago in a former birth I
was a certain Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, and now I have fallen into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>world of men in consequence of a curse. For when
I was a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, I bit asunder some strings with my
teeth and fastened them to lyres, and it is owing to that that I have
been born here in the house of a fisherman. So, if such a degradation
is brought about by touching the mouth with the dry sinew of a cow,
much more terrible must be the result of eating cow&rsquo;s
flesh!&rdquo; While she was saying this, one of her brothers rushed in
in a state of perturbation, and said to &#346;aktideva, &ldquo;Rise up,
an enormous boar has appeared from somewhere or other, and after
slaying innumerable persons is coming this way in its pride, towards
us.&rdquo; When &#346;aktideva heard that, he descended from his
palace, and mounting a horse, spear in hand,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6410src" href="#xd27e6410" name="xd27e6410src">12</a> he galloped
to meet the boar, and struck it the moment he saw it, but when the hero
attacked him the boar fled, and managed, though wounded, to enter a
cavern: and &#346;aktideva entered there in pursuit of him, and
immediately beheld a great garden-shrubbery with a house. And when he
was there, he beheld a maiden of very wonderful beauty, coming in a
state of agitation to meet him, as if it were the goddess of the wood
advancing to receive him out of love.</p>
<p>And he asked her,&mdash;&ldquo;Auspicious lady, who are you, and why
are you perturbed?&rdquo;&mdash;Hearing that, the lovely one thus
answered him; &ldquo;There is a king of the name of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;avikrama, lord of the southern region. I am his
daughter, auspicious sir, a maiden named Vindurekh&aacute;. But a
wicked Daitya, with flaming eyes, carried me off by treachery from my
father&rsquo;s house to-day, and brought me here. And he, desiring
flesh, assumed the form of a boar, and sallied out, but while he was
still hungry, he was pierced with a spear to-day by some hero; and as
soon as he was pierced, he came in here and died. And I rushed out and
escaped without being outraged by him.&rdquo; Then &#346;aktideva said
to her, &ldquo;Then why all this perturbation? For I slew that boar
with a spear, princess.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;Tell me who you
are,&rdquo; and he answered her &ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman named
&#346;aktideva.&rdquo; Then she said to him, &ldquo;You must
accordingly become my husband,&rdquo; and the hero consenting went out
of the cavern with her. And when he arrived at home, he told it to his
wife Vindumat&iacute;, and with her consent he married that princess
Vindurekh&aacute;. So, while &#346;aktideva was living there with his
two wives, one of his wives Vindurekh&aacute; became pregnant; and in
the eighth month of her pregnancy, the first wife Vindumat&iacute; came
up to him of her own accord and said to him, &ldquo;Hero, remember what
you promised me; this is the eighth month of the pregnancy of your
second wife: so go and cut her open and bring the child here, for you
cannot act contrary to your own word of honour.&rdquo; When she said
this to &#346;aktideva, he was bewildered by affection and compassion;
but being bound by his promise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229"
href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>he remained for a short time
unable to give an answer; at last he departed in a state of agitation
and went to Vindurekh&aacute;; and she seeing him come with troubled
air, said to him, &ldquo;Husband, why are you despondent to-day? Surely
I know; you have been commissioned by Vindumat&iacute; to take out the
child with which I am pregnant; and that you must certainly do, for
there is a certain object in view, and there is no cruelty in it, so do
not feel compunction; in proof of it, hear the following story of
Devadatta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<h3 class="main">Story of Devadatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in the city of Kambuka a
Br&aacute;hman named Haridatta; and the son of that auspicious man, who
was named Devadatta, though he studied in his boyhood, was, as a young
man, exclusively addicted to the vice of gaming. As he had lost his
clothes and everything by gambling, he was not able to return to his
father&rsquo;s house, so he entered once on a time an empty temple. And
there he saw alone a great ascetic, named J&aacute;lap&aacute;da, who
had attained many objects by magic, and he was muttering spells in a
corner. So he went up to him slowly and bowed before him, and the
ascetic, abandoning his habit of not speaking to any one, greeted him
with a welcome; and after he had remained there a moment, the ascetic,
seeing his trouble, asked him the cause, and he told him of his
affliction produced by the loss of his wealth, which had been
dissipated in gambling. Then the ascetic said to Devadatta; &ldquo;My
child, there is not wealth enough in the whole world to satisfy
gamblers; but if you desire to escape from your calamity, do what I
tell you, for I have made preparations to attain the rank of a
Vidy&aacute;dhara; so help me to accomplish this, O man of fortunate
destiny,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6431src" href="#xd27e6431" name=
"xd27e6431src">13</a> you have only to obey my orders and then your
calamities will be at an end.&rdquo; When the ascetic said this to him,
Devadatta promised to obey him, and immediately took up his residence
with him. And the next day the ascetic went into a corner of the
cemetery and performed worship by night under a <i>banyan</i>-tree, and
offered rice boiled in milk, and flung portions of the oblation towards
the four cardinal points, after worshipping them, and said to the
Br&aacute;hman who was in attendance on him; &ldquo;You must worship
here in this style every day, and say &lsquo;Vidyutprabh&aacute;,
accept this worship.&rsquo; And then I am certain that we shall both
attain our ends;&rdquo; having said this the ascetic went with him to
his own house. Then Devadatta, consenting, went every day and duly
performed worship at the foot of that tree, according to his
instructions. And one day, at the end of his worship, the tree suddenly
clave open, and a heavenly nymph came out of it before his eyes, and
said, &ldquo;My good sir, my mistress summons you to come to
her.&rdquo; And then she introduced him into the middle of that tree.
When he entered it, he beheld a heavenly palace made of jewels, and a
beautiful lady within it reclining upon a sofa. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>And
he immediately thought&mdash;&ldquo;This may be the success of our
enterprise incarnate in bodily form,&rdquo; but while he was thinking
thus, that beautiful lady, receiving him graciously, rose with limbs on
which the ornaments rang as if to welcome him, and seated him on her
own sofa. And she said to him, &ldquo;Illustrious sir, I am the maiden
daughter of a king of the Yakshas, named Ratnavarsha, and I am known by
the name of Vidyutprabh&aacute;; and this great ascetic
J&aacute;lap&aacute;da was endeavouring to gain my favour, to him I
will give the attainment of his ends, but you are the lord of my life.
So, as you see my affection, marry me.&rdquo; When she said this,
Devadatta consented, and did so. And he remained there some time, but
when she became pregnant, he went to the great ascetic with the
intention of returning, and in a state of terror he told him all that
had happened, and the ascetic, desiring his own success, said to him,
&ldquo;My good sir, you have acted quite rightly, but go and cut open
that <span class="corr" id="xd27e6439" title=
"Source: Yakshi">Yaksh&iacute;</span> and taking out the embryo, bring
it quickly here.&rdquo; The ascetic said this to him, and then reminded
him of his previous promise, and being dismissed by him, the
Br&aacute;hman returned to his beloved, and while he stood there
despondent with reflecting on what he had to do, the Yaksh&iacute;
Vidyutprabh&aacute; of her own accord said to him;&mdash;&ldquo;My
husband, why are you cast down? I know, J&aacute;lap&aacute;da has
ordered you to cut me open, so cut me open and take out this child, and
if you refuse, I will do it myself, for there is an object in
it.&rdquo; Though she said this to him, the Br&aacute;hman could not
bring himself to do it, then she cut herself open and took out the
child, and flung it down before him and said, &ldquo;Take this, which
will enable him who consumes it, to obtain the rank of a
Vidy&aacute;dhara. But I, though properly a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;,
have been born as a Yaksh&iacute; owing to a curse, and this is the
appointed end of my curse, strange as it is, for I remember my former
existence. Now I depart to my proper home, but we two shall meet again
in that place.&rdquo; Saying this Vidyutprabh&aacute; vanished from his
eyes. And Devadatta took the child with sorrowful mind, and went to
that ascetic J&aacute;lap&aacute;da, and gave it to him, as that which
would ensure the success of his incantations, for good men do not even
in calamity give way to selfishness. The great ascetic divided the
child&rsquo;s flesh, and sent Devadatta to the wood to worship
Durg&aacute; in her terrific form. And when the Br&aacute;hman came
back after presenting an oblation, he saw that the ascetic had made
away with all the flesh. And while he said&mdash;&ldquo;What, have you
consumed it all?&rdquo; the treacherous J&aacute;lap&aacute;da, having
become a Vidy&aacute;dhara, ascended to heaven. When he had flown up,
with sword blue as the sky, adorned with necklace and bracelet,
Devadatta reflected, &ldquo;Alas! how I have been deceived by this
evil-minded one! Or rather on whom does not excessive compliance entail
misfortune? So how can I revenge myself on him for this ill turn, and
how can I reach <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231"
name="pb231">231</a>]</span>him who has become a Vidy&aacute;dhara?
Well! I have no other resource in this matter except propitiating a
Vet&aacute;la.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6445src" href=
"#xd27e6445" name="xd27e6445src">14</a> After he had made up his mind
to do this, he went at night to the cemetery. There he summoned at the
foot of a tree a Vet&aacute;la into the body of a man, and after
worshipping him, he made an oblation of human flesh to him. And as that
Vet&aacute;la was not satisfied, and would not wait for him to bring
more, he prepared to cut off his own flesh in order to gratify him. And
immediately that Vet&aacute;la said to that brave man;&mdash;&ldquo;I
am pleased with this courage of yours, do not act recklessly. So, my
good sir, what desire have you for me to accomplish for you?&rdquo;
When the Vet&aacute;la said this, the hero answered him; &ldquo;Take me
to the dwelling-place of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, where is the ascetic
J&aacute;lap&aacute;da, who deceives those that repose confidence in
him, in order that I may punish him.&rdquo; The Vet&aacute;la
consented, and placing him on his shoulder, carried him through the air
in a moment to the dwelling of the Vidy&aacute;dharas; and there he saw
J&aacute;lap&aacute;da in a palace, seated on a jewelled throne, elated
at being a king among the Vidy&aacute;dharas, endeavouring by various
speeches to induce that Vidyutprabh&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6448src" href="#xd27e6448" name="xd27e6448src">15</a> who had
obtained the rank of a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, to marry him in spite
of her reluctance. And the moment that the young man saw him, he
attacked him with the help of the Vet&aacute;la, being to the eyes of
the delighted Vidyutprabh&aacute;, what the moon, the repository of
nectar, is to the partridges.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6457src" href=
"#xd27e6457" name="xd27e6457src">16</a> And J&aacute;lap&aacute;da
beholding him suddenly arrived in this way, dropped his sword in his
fright, and fell from his throne on the floor. But Devadatta, though he
had obtained his sword, did not slay him, for the great-hearted feel
pity even for their enemies when they are terrified.</p>
<p>And when the Vet&aacute;la wanted to kill him, he dissuaded him, and
said, &ldquo;Of what use will it be to us to kill this miserable
heretic? So take him and place him in his own house on earth, it is
better that this wicked skull-bearing ascetic should remain
there.&rdquo; At the very moment that Devadatta was saying this, the
goddess Durg&aacute; descended from heaven and appeared to him, and
said to him who bent before her, &ldquo;My son, I am satisfied with
thee now, on account of this incomparable courage of thine; so I give
thee on the spot the rank of king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo;
Having said this, she bestowed the magic sciences<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6462src" href="#xd27e6462" name="xd27e6462src">17</a> on him, and
immediately disappeared. And the Vet&aacute;la immediately took
J&aacute;lap&aacute;da, whose splendour fell from him, and placed him
on earth; (wickedness does not long ensure success;) and Devadatta
accompanied by Vidyutprabh&aacute;, having obtained that sovereignty of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, flourished in his kingdom. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having told this story to her husband &#346;aktideva, the
softly-speaking Vindurekh&aacute; again said to him with eagerness;
&ldquo;Such necessities do arise, so cut out this child of mine as
Vindumat&iacute; told you, without remorse.&rdquo; When
Vindurekh&aacute; said this, &#346;aktideva was afraid of doing wrong,
but a voice sounded from heaven at this juncture, &ldquo;O
&#346;aktideva, take out this child without fear, and seize it by the
neck with your hand, then it will turn into a sword.&rdquo; Having
heard this divine voice, he cut her open; and quickly taking out the
child, he seized it by the throat with his hand; and no sooner did he
seize it, than it became a sword in his hand; like the long hair of
Good Fortune seized by him with an abiding grasp. Then that
Br&aacute;hman quickly became a Vidy&aacute;dhara, and
Vindurekh&aacute; that moment disappeared. And when he saw that, he
went, as he was, to his second wife Vindumat&iacute;, and told her the
whole story. She said to him, &ldquo;My lord, we are three sisters, the
daughter of a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, who have been banished
from Kanakapur&iacute; in consequence of a curse. The first was
Kanakarekh&aacute;, the termination of whose curse you beheld in the
city of Vardham&aacute;na; and she has gone to that city of hers, her
proper home. For such was the strange end of her curse, according to
the dispensation of fate, and I am the third sister, and now my curse
is at an end. And this very day I must go to that city of mine, my
beloved, for there our Vidy&aacute;dhara bodies remain. And my elder
sister, Chandraprabh&aacute;, is dwelling there; so you also must come
there quickly by virtue of the magic power of your sword. And you shall
rule in that city, after obtaining all four of us as wives, bestowed
upon you by our father who has retired to the forest, and others in
addition to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Vindumat&iacute; declared the truth about herself, and
&#346;aktideva consenting, went again to the City of Gold, this time
through the air, together with that Vindumat&iacute;. And when he
arrived, he again saw those three darlings of his bending before him,
Kanakarekh&aacute; and the others, after entering with their souls, as
was fitting, those heavenly female bodies, which he saw on a former
occasion extended lifeless on the couches in those three pavilions. And
he saw that fourth sister there, Chandraprabh&aacute;, who had
performed auspicious ceremonies, and was drinking in his form with an
eye rendered eager by seeing him after so long an absence. His arrival
was joyfully hailed by the servants, who were occupied in their several
duties, as well as by the ladies, and when he entered the private
apartments, that <span class="corr" id="xd27e6470" title=
"Source: Chandrapabh&aacute;">Chandraprabh&aacute;</span> said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Noble sir, here is that princess Kanakarekh&aacute;,
who was seen by you in the city of Vardham&aacute;na, my sister called
Chandrarekh&aacute;. And here is that daughter of the fisher king,
Vindumat&iacute;, whom you first married in the island of Utsthala, my
sister &#346;a&#347;irekh&aacute;. And here is my youngest sister
&#346;a&#347;iprabh&aacute;, the princess who after that was brought
there by the D&aacute;nava, and then became your wife. So now come,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>successful hero, with us into the presence of
our father, and quickly marry us all, when bestowed upon you by
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Chandraprabh&aacute; had swiftly and boldly uttered this decree
of Cupid, &#346;aktideva went with those four to the recesses of the
wood to meet their father, and their father, the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, having been informed of the facts by all his
daughters who bowed at his feet, and also moved by a divine voice, with
delighted soul gave them all at once to &#346;aktideva. Immediately
after that, he bestowed on &#346;aktideva his opulent realm in the City
of Gold, and all his magic sciences, and he gave the successful hero
his name, by which he was henceforth known among his
Vidy&aacute;dharas. And he said to him; &ldquo;No one else shall
conquer thee, but from the mighty lord of Vatsa there shall spring a
universal emperor, who shall reign among you here under the title of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta and be thy superior, to him alone wilt thou have
to submit.&rdquo; With these words the mighty lord of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named &#346;a&#347;ikha&#7751;&#7693;apada,
dismissed his son-in-law from the wood where he was practising
asceticism, after entertaining him kindly, that he might go with his
wives to his own capital. Then that &#346;aktivega, having become a
king, entered the City of Gold, that glory of the Vidy&aacute;dhara
world, proceeding thither with his wives. Living in that city, the
palaces of which gleamed with fabric of gold, which seemed on account
of its great height to be the condensed rays of the sun falling in
brightness, he enjoyed exceeding happiness with those fair-eyed wives,
in charming gardens, the lakes of which had steps made out of
jewels.</p>
<p>Having thus related his wonderful history, the eloquent
&#346;aktivega went on to say to the king of Vatsa, &ldquo;Know me, O
lord of Vatsa, ornament of the lunar race, to be that very
&#346;aktideva come here, full of desire to behold the two feet of your
son who is just born, and is destined to be our new emperor. Thus I
have obtained, though originally a man, the rank of sovereign among the
Vidy&aacute;dharas by the favour of &#346;iva: and now, O king, I
return to my own home; I have seen our future lord; may you enjoy
unfailing felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After finishing his tale, &#346;aktivega said this with clasped
hands, and receiving permission to depart, immediately flew up into the
sky like the moon in brightness, and then the king of Vatsa in the
company of his wives, surrounded by his ministers, and with his young
son, enjoyed, in his own capital a state of indescribable felicity.

"#xd27e6519" name="xd27e6519src">3</a> on the banks of the
Vitast&aacute;, the reflection of whose long line of palaces gleamed in
the waters of the river, as if it were the capital of the lower regions
come to gaze at its splendour. In it there dwelt a king named
Kalingadatta, a distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>Buddhist, all whose subjects
were devoted to the great Buddha the bridegroom of
T&aacute;r&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6524src" href=
"#xd27e6524" name="xd27e6524src">4</a> His city shone with splendid
Buddhist temples densely crowded together, as if with the horns of
pride elevated because it had no rival upon earth. He not only
cherished his subjects like a father, but also himself taught them
knowledge like a spiritual guide. Moreover there was in that city a
certain rich Buddhist merchant called Vitastadatta, who was exclusively
devoted to the honouring of Buddhist mendicants. And he had a son, a
young man named Ratnadatta. And he was always expressing his
detestation of his father, calling him an impious man. And when his
father said to him, &ldquo;Son, why do you blame me?&rdquo;&mdash;the
merchant&rsquo;s son answered with bitter scorn, &ldquo;My father, you
abandon the religion of the three Vedas and cultivate irreligion. For
you neglect the Br&aacute;hmans and are always honouring
&#346;rama&#7751;as.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6530src" href=
"#xd27e6530" name="xd27e6530src">5</a> What have you to do with that
Buddhist discipline, which all kinds of low-caste men resort to, to
gratify their desire to have a convent to dwell in, released from
bathing and other strict ordinances, loving to feed whenever it is

"xd27e6535src">6</a> rejecting the Br&aacute;hmanical lock and other
prescribed methods of doing the hair, quite at ease with only a rag
round their loins?&rdquo; When the merchant heard that he
said&mdash;&ldquo;Religion is not confined to one form; a transcendent
religion is a different thing from a religion that embraces the whole
world. People say that Br&aacute;hmanism too consists in avoiding
passion and other sins, in truth, and compassion to creatures, not in
quarrelling causelessly with one&rsquo;s relations.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6545src" href="#xd27e6545" name="xd27e6545src">7</a> Moreover
you ought not to blame generally that school which I follow, which
extends security to all creatures, on account of the fault of an
individual. Nobody questions the propriety of conferring benefits, and
my beneficence consists simply in giving security to creatures. So, if
I take exceeding pleasure in this system, the principal characteristic
of which is abstinence from injuring any creature, and which brings
liberation, wherein am I irreligious in doing so?&rdquo; When his
father said this to him, that merchant&rsquo;s son obstinately refused
to admit it, and only blamed his father all the more. Then his father,
in disgust, went and reported the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>whole matter to the king
Kalingadatta, who superintended the religion of his people. The king,
for his part, summoned on some pretext the merchant&rsquo;s son into
his judgement-hall, and feigning an anger he did not feel, said to the
executioner, &ldquo;I have heard that this merchant&rsquo;s son is
wicked and addicted to horrible crimes, so slay him without mercy as a
corrupter of the realm.&rdquo; When the king had said this, the father
interceded, and then the king appointed that the execution should be
put off for two months, in order that he might learn virtue, and
entrusted the merchant&rsquo;s son to the custody of his father, to be
brought again into his presence at the end of that time. The
merchant&rsquo;s son, when he had been taken home to his father&rsquo;s
house, was distracted with fear, and kept thinking, &ldquo;What crime
can I have committed against the king?&rdquo; and pondering over his
causeless execution which was to take place at the end of two months;
and so he could get no sleep day or night, and was exhausted by taking
less than his usual food at all times. Then, the reprieve of two months
having expired, that merchant&rsquo;s son was again taken, thin and
pale, into the presence of the king. And the king seeing him in such a
depressed state said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Why have you become so thin?
Did I order you not to eat?&rdquo; When the merchant&rsquo;s son heard
that, he said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot myself for fear, much
more my food. Ever since I heard your majesty order my execution, I
have been thinking every day of death slowly advancing.&rdquo; When the
merchant&rsquo;s son said this, the king said to him, &ldquo;I have by
an artifice made you teach yourself what the fear of death is.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6553src" href="#xd27e6553" name="xd27e6553src">8</a>
Such must be the fear which every living creature entertains of death,
and tell me what higher piety can there be than the benefit of
preserving creatures from that? So I shewed you this in order that you
might acquire religion and the desire of salvation,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6561src" href="#xd27e6561" name="xd27e6561src">9</a> for a
wise man being afraid of death strives to attain salvation. Therefore
you must not blame your father who follows this religion.&rdquo; When
the merchant&rsquo;s son heard this, he bowed and said to the
king&mdash;&ldquo;Your majesty has made me a blessed man by teaching me
religion, and now a desire for salvation has arisen in me, teach me
that also, my lord.&rdquo; When the king heard that, as it was a feast
in the city, he gave a vessel full of oil into the hand of the
merchant&rsquo;s son and said to him, &ldquo;Take this vessel in your
hand and walk all round this city, and you must avoid spilling a single
drop of it, my son; if you spill one drop of it, these men will
immediately cut you down.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6566src"
href="#xd27e6566" name="xd27e6566src">10</a> Having said this, the king
dismissed the merchant&rsquo;s son to walk round the city, ordering men
with drawn swords to follow him. The merchant&rsquo;s son, in his fear,
took care to avoid spilling a drop of oil, and having perambulated that
city with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>much difficulty, returned into the presence of
the king. The king, when he saw that he had brought the oil without
spilling it, said to him: &ldquo;Did you see any one to-day, as you
went along in your perambulation of the city?&rdquo; When the
merchant&rsquo;s son heard that, he clasped his hands, and said to the
king&mdash;&ldquo;In truth, my lord, I neither saw nor heard any thing,
for at the time when I was perambulating the city I had my undivided
attention fixed on avoiding spilling a drop of oil, lest the swords
should descend upon me.&rdquo; When the merchant&rsquo;s son said this,
the king said to him; &ldquo;Because your whole soul was intent on
looking at the oil, you saw nothing. So practise religious
contemplation with the same undivided attention. For a man, who with
intent concentration averts his attention from all outward operations,
has intuition of the truth, and after that intuition he is not
entangled again in the meshes of works. Thus I have given you in a
compendious form instruction in the doctrine of salvation.&rdquo; Thus
the king spoke and dismissed him, and the merchant&rsquo;s son fell at
his feet and went home rejoicing to his father&rsquo;s house, having
attained all his objects. This Kalingadatta, who superintended in this
way the religion of his subjects, had a wife named
T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, of equal birth with the king, who being
politic <span class="corr" id="xd27e6574" title=
"Source: and and">and</span> well-conducted, was such an ornament to
the king as language is to a poet, who delights in numerous
illustrations. She was meritorious for her bright qualities and was
inseparable from that beloved king, being to him what the moonlight is
to the moon, the receptacle of nectar. The king lived happily there
with that queen, and passed his days like Indra with &#346;ach&iacute;
in heaven.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Apsaras Surabhidatt&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this point of my tale Indra, for some cause or
other, had a great feast in heaven. All the Apsarases assembled there
to dance, except one beautiful Apsaras named Surabhidatt&aacute;, who
was not to be seen there. Then Indra by his divine power of insight
perceived her associating in secret with a certain Vidy&aacute;dhara in
Nandana. When Indra saw it, wrath arose in his bosom, and he
thought&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! these two, blinded with love, are both wicked:
the Apsaras, because forgetting us she acts in a wilful manner, the
Vidy&aacute;dhara, because he enters the domain of the gods and commits
improprieties. Or rather, what fault is that miserable
Vidy&aacute;dhara guilty of? For she has enticed him here, ensnaring
him with her beauty. A lovely one will sweep away with the sea of her
beauty, flowing between the lofty banks of her breasts, even one who
can restrain his passions. Was not even &#346;iva disturbed long ago
when he beheld Tilottam&aacute;, whom the Creator made by taking an
atom from all the noblest beings?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6582src"
href="#xd27e6582" name="xd27e6582src">11</a> And did not

old age for love of &#346;armish&#7789;&aacute;? So this young
Vidy&aacute;dhara has committed no crime in allowing himself to be
allured by an Apsaras with her beauty, which is able to bewilder the
three worlds.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6587src" href="#xd27e6587"
name="xd27e6587src">12</a> But this heavenly nymph is in fault, wicked
creature, void of virtue, who has deserted the gods, and introduced
this fellow into Nandana.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the lover of
Ahaly&aacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6590src" href="#xd27e6590"
name="xd27e6590src">13</a> spared the Vidy&aacute;dhara youth, but
cursed that Apsaras in the following words: &ldquo;Wicked one, take
upon thyself a mortal nature, but after thou hast obtained a daughter
not sprung from the womb, and hast accomplished the object of the gods,
thou shalt return to this heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, the consort of that
king in the city of Taksha&#347;il&aacute;, reached the period
favourable for procreation. And Surabhidatt&aacute;, the Apsaras who
had been degraded from heaven by the curse of Indra, was conceived in
her, giving beauty to her whole body. Then
T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute; beheld in a dream a flame descending
from heaven and entering into her womb; and in the morning she
described with astonishment her dream to her husband, the king
Kalingadatta; and he being pleased said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;Queen,
heavenly beings owing to a curse fall into human births, so I am
persuaded that this is some divine being conceived in you. For beings,
bound by various works, good and evil, are ever revolving in the state
of mundane existence in these three worlds, to receive fruits blessed
and miserable.&rdquo; When the queen was thus addressed by the king,
she took the opportunity of saying to him; &ldquo;It is true, actions,
good and bad, have a wonderful power, producing the perception of joy
and sorrow,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6595src" href="#xd27e6595" name=

<h3 class="main">Story of king Dharmadatta and his wife
N&aacute;ga&#347;r&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once lived a king named Dharmadatta, the lord of
Ko&#347;ala; he had a queen named N&aacute;ga&#347;r&iacute;, who was
devoted to her husband and was called Arundhat&iacute; on the earth,
as, like her, she was the chief of virtuous women. And in course of
time, O slayer of your enemies, I was born as the daughter of that king
by that queen; then, while I was a mere child, that mother of mine
suddenly remembered her former birth and said to her husband; &ldquo;O
king, I have suddenly to-day remembered my former birth; it is
<span class="corr" id="xd27e6609" title=
"Source: disagreable">disagreeable</span> to me not to tell it, but if
I do tell it, it will cause my death, because they say that, if a
person suddenly remembers his or her former birth and tells it, it
surely brings death. Therefore, king, I feel excessively
despondent.&rdquo; When his queen said this to him, the king answered
her; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>&ldquo;My beloved, I, like you, have suddenly
remembered my former birth; therefore tell me yours, and I will tell
you mine, let what will be, be; for who can alter the decree of
fate.&rdquo; When thus urged by her husband, the queen said to him,
&ldquo;If you press the matter, king, then I will tell you, listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my former birth I was a well-conducted female slave in
this very land, in the house of a certain Br&aacute;hman named
M&aacute;dhava. And in that birth I had a husband named
Devad&aacute;sa, an excellent hired servant in the house of a certain
merchant. And so we two dwelled there, having built a house that suited
us, living on the cooked rice brought from the houses of our respective
masters. A water vessel and a pitcher, a broom and a brazier, and I and
my husband, formed three couples. We lived happy and contented in our
house into which the demon of quarrelling never entered, eating the
little food that remained over after we had made offerings to the gods,
the manes and guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And any clothes which either of us had over, we gave to some
poor person or other. Then there arose a grievous famine in our
country, and owing to that the allowance of food, which we had to
receive every day, began to come to us in small quantities. Then our
bodies became attenuated by hunger, and we began to despond in mind,
when once on a time at meal-time there arrived a weary Br&aacute;hman
guest. To him we both gave all our own food, as much as we had, though
we were in danger of our lives. When the Br&aacute;hman had eaten and
departed, my husband&rsquo;s breath left him, as if angry that he
respected a guest more than it. And then I heaped up in honour of my
husband a suitable pyre, and ascended it, and so laid down the load of
my own calamity. Then I was born in a royal family, and I became your
queen, for the tree of good deeds produces to the righteous
inconceivably glorious fruit.&rdquo; When his queen said this to him,
the king Dharmadatta said&mdash;&ldquo;Come, my beloved, I am that
husband of thine in a former birth; I was that very Devad&aacute;sa the
merchant&rsquo;s servant, for I have remembered this moment this former
existence of mine.&rdquo; Having said this, and mentioned the tokens of
his own identity, the king, despondent and yet glad, suddenly went with
his queen to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way my parents went to another world, and my
mother&rsquo;s sister brought me to her own house to rear me, and while
I was unmarried, there came there a certain Br&aacute;hman guest, and
my mother&rsquo;s sister ordered me to wait on him. And I diligently
strove to please him as Kunt&iacute; to please Durv&aacute;sas, and
owing to a boon conferred by him, I obtained you, a virtuous husband.
Thus good fortune is the result of virtue, owing to which my parents
were both born at the same time in royal families, and also remembered
their former birth.&rdquo; Having heard this speech of the queen
T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, the king Kalingadatta, who was
exclusively devoted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>righteousness, answered her,
&ldquo;It is true, a trifling act of righteousness duly performed will
bring much fruit, and in proof of this, O queen, hear the ancient tale
of the seven Br&aacute;hmans.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, in a city called Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina, a
certain Br&aacute;hman teacher had for pupils seven sons of
Br&aacute;hmans. Then that teacher, under pressure of famine, sent
those pupils to ask his father-in-law, who was rich in cows, to give
him one. And those pupils of his went, with their bellies pinched by
hunger, to his father-in-law, who dwelt in another land, and asked him,
as their teacher had ordered them, for a cow. He gave them one cow to
support them, but the miserly fellow did not give them food, though
they were hungry. Then they took the cow, and as they were returning
and had accomplished half the journey, being excessively pained by
hunger, they fell exhausted on the earth. They said&mdash;&ldquo;Our
teacher&rsquo;s house is far off, and we are afflicted by calamity far
from home, and food is hard to obtain everywhere, so it is all over
with our lives. And in the same way this cow is certain to die in this
wilderness without water, wood, or human beings, and our teacher will
not derive even the smallest advantage from it. So let us support our
lives with its flesh, and quickly restore our teacher and his family
with what remains over: for it is a time of sore distress.&rdquo;
Having thus deliberated, those seven students treated that cow as a
victim, and sacrificed it on the spot according to the system
prescribed in the sacred treatises. After sacrificing to the gods and
manes, and eating its flesh according to the prescribed method, they
went and took what remained of it to their teacher. They bowed before
him, and told him all that they had done, to the letter, and he was
pleased with them, because they told the truth, though they had
committed a fault. And after seven days they died of famine, but
because they told the truth on that occasion, they were born again with
the power of remembering their former birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus even a small germ of merit, watered with the water of
holy aspiration, bears fruit to men in general, as a seed to
cultivators, but the same corrupted by the water of impure aspiration
bears fruit in the form of misfortune, and <i>&agrave; propos</i> of

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time two men remained for the same length of
time fasting on the banks of the Ganges, one a Br&aacute;hman and the
other a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la. Of those two, the Br&aacute;hman
being overpowered with hunger, and seeing some Nish&aacute;das<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6642src" href="#xd27e6642" name=
"xd27e6642src">16</a> come that way bringing fish and eating them, thus
reflected in his folly&mdash;&ldquo;O happy in the world are these
fishermen, sons of female <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>slaves though they be, for they
eat to their fill of the fresh meat of fish!&rdquo; But the other, who
was a Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, thought, the moment he saw those
fishermen, &ldquo;Out on these destroyers of life, and devourers of raw
flesh! So why should I stand here and behold their faces?&rdquo; Saying
this to himself, he closed his eyes and remained buried in his own
thoughts. And in course of time those two, the Br&aacute;hman and the
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, died of starvation; the Br&aacute;hman was
eaten by dogs on the bank, the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la rotted in
the water of the Ganges. So that Br&aacute;hman, not having disciplined
his spirit, was born in the family of a fisherman, but owing to the
virtue of the holy place, he remembered his former existence. As for
that Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la, who possessed self-control, and whose
mind was not marred by passion, he was born as a king in a palace on
that very bank of the Ganges, and recollected his former birth. And of
those two, who were born with a remembrance of their former existence,
the one suffered misery being a fisherman, the other being a king
enjoyed happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the root of the tree of virtue; according to the
purity or impurity of a man&rsquo;s heart is without doubt the fruit
which he receives.&rdquo; Having said this to the queen
T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, king Kalingadatta again said to her in
the course of conversation,&mdash;&ldquo;Moreover actions which are
really distinguished by great courage produce fruit, since prosperity
follows on courage; and to illustrate this I will tell the following
wonderful tale. Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vikramasinha and the two
Br&aacute;hmans.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in Avanti a city named Ujjayin&iacute;,
famous in the world, which is the dwelling-place of &#346;iva,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6654src" href="#xd27e6654" name=
"xd27e6654src">17</a> and which gleams with its white palaces as if
with the peaks of Kail&aacute;sa, come thither in the ardour of their
devotion to the god. This vast city, profound as the sea, having a
splendid emperor for its water, had hundreds of armies entering it, as
hundreds of rivers flow into the sea, and was the refuge of allied
kings, as the sea is of mountains that retain their wings.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6657src" href="#xd27e6657" name=
"xd27e6657src">18</a> In that city there was a king who had the name of
Vikramasinha,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6660src" href="#xd27e6660"
name="xd27e6660src">19</a> a name that thoroughly expressed his
character, for his enemies were like deer and never met him in fight.
And he, because he could never find any enemy to face him, became
disgusted with weapons and the might of his arm, and was inwardly
grieved as he never obtained the joy of battle. Then his minister
Amaragupta, who discovered his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>longing, said to him
incidentally in the course of conversation&mdash;&ldquo;King, it is not
hard for kings to incur guilt, if through pride in their strong arms,
and confidence in their skill in the use of weapons, they even long for
enemies; in this way B&aacute;&#7751;a in old time, through pride in
his thousand arms, propitiated &#346;iva and asked for an enemy that
was a match for him in fight, until at last <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e6667" title="Source: h&iacute;s">his</span> prayer was actually
granted, and Vish&#7751;u became his enemy, and cut off his innumerable
arms in battle. So you must not shew dissatisfaction because you do not
obtain an opportunity of fighting, and a terrible enemy must never be
desired. If you want to shew here your skill in weapons and your
strength, shew it in the forest an appropriate field for it, and in
hunting. And since kings are not generally exposed to fatigue, hunting
is approved to give them exercise and excitement, but warlike
expeditions are not recommended. Moreover the malignant wild animals
desire that the earth should be depopulated, for this reason the king
should slay them; on this ground too hunting is approved. But wild
animals should not be too unremittingly pursued, for it was owing to
the vice of exclusive devotion to hunting that former kings,
P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;u and others, met destruction.&rdquo; When the
wise minister Amaragupta said this to him, the king Vikramasinha
approved the advice saying&mdash;&ldquo;I will do so.&rdquo; And the
next day the king went out of the city to hunt, to a district beset
with horses, footmen and dogs, and where all the quarters were filled
with the pitching of various nets, and he made the heaven resound with
the shouts of joyous huntsmen. And as he was going out on the back of
an elephant, he saw two men sitting together in private in an empty
temple outside the walls. And the king, as he beheld them from afar,
supposed that they were only deliberating together over something at
their leisure, and passed on to the forest where his hunting was to be.
There he was delighted with the drawn swords, and with the old tigers,
and the roaring of lions, and the scenery, and the elephants. He
strewed that ground with pearls fallen from the nails of
elephant-slaying lions whom he killed, resembling the seeds of his
prowess. The deer leaping sideways, being oblique-goers,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6671src" href="#xd27e6671" name=
"xd27e6671src">20</a> went obliquely across his path; his
straight-flying arrow easily transfixing them first, reached afterwards
the mark of delight. And after the king had long enjoyed the sport of
hunting, he returned, as his servants were weary, with slackened
bowstring to the city of Ujjayin&iacute;. There he saw those two men,
whom he had seen as he was going out, who had remained the whole time
in the temple occupied in the same way. He thought to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Who are these, and why do they deliberate so long?
Surely they must be spies, having a long talk over secrets.&rdquo; So
he sent his warder, and had those men <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>captured and brought
into his presence, and then thrown into prison. And the next day he had
them brought into his judgement-hall, and asked them&mdash;&ldquo;Who
are you and why did you deliberate together so long?&rdquo; When the
king in person asked them this, they entreated him to spare their
lives, and one of these young men began to say; &ldquo;Hear, O king, I
will now tell the whole story as it happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There lived a Br&aacute;hman, of the name of Karabhaka, in
this very city of yours. I, whom you see here, am the son of that
learned student of the Vedas, born by his propitiating the god of fire
in order to obtain a heroic son. And, when my father went to heaven,
and his wife followed him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6682src" href=
"#xd27e6682" name="xd27e6682src">21</a> I being a mere boy, though I
had learned the sciences, abandoned the course of life suited to my
caste, because I was friendless. And I set myself to practise gaming
and the use of arms; what boy does not become self-willed if he is not
kept in order by some superior? And, having passed my childhood in this
way, I acquired overweening confidence in my prowess, and went one day
to the forest to practise archery. And while I was thus engaged, a
bride came out of the city in a covered <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e6687" title="Source: palankeen">palanquin</span>, surrounded by
many attendants of the bridegroom. And suddenly an elephant, that had
broken its chain, came from some quarter or other at that very moment,
and attacked that bride in its fury. And through fear of that elephant,
all those cowardly attendants and her husband with them deserted the
bride, and fled in all directions. When I saw that, I immediately said
to myself in my excitement,&mdash;&lsquo;What! have these miserable
wretches left this unfortunate woman alone? So I must defend this
unprotected lady from this elephant. For what is the use of life or
courage, unless employed to succour the unfortunate?&rsquo; Thus
reflecting I raised a shout and ran towards that huge elephant; and the
elephant, abandoning the woman, charged down upon me. Then I, before
the eyes of that terrified woman, shouted and ran, and so drew off that
elephant to a distance, at last I got hold of a bough of a tree thickly
covered with leaves, which had been broken off, and covering myself
with it, I went into the middle of the tree; and placing the bough in
front of me, I escaped by a dexterous oblique movement, while the
elephant trampled the bough to pieces. Then I quickly went to that
lady, who remained terrified there, and asked her whether she had
escaped without injury. She, when she saw me, said with afflicted and
yet joyful manner; &lsquo;How can I be said to be uninjured, now that I
have been bestowed on this coward, who has deserted me in such straits,
and fled somewhere or other; but so far at any rate I am uninjured,
that I again behold you unharmed. So my husband is nothing to me; you
henceforth are my husband, by whom regardless of your life, I have been
delivered from the jaws of death. And here I see <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>my
husband coming with his servants, so follow us slowly; for when we get
an opportunity, you and I will elope somewhere together.&rsquo; When
she said this, I consented. I ought to have thought&mdash;&lsquo;Though
this woman is beautiful, and flings herself at my head, yet she is the
wife of another; what have I to do with her?&rsquo; But this is the
course of calm self-restraint, not of ardent youth. And in a moment her
husband came up and greeted her, and she proceeded to continue her
journey with him and his servants. And I, without being detected,
followed her through her long journey, being secretly supplied with
provisions for the journey by her, though I passed for some one
unconnected with her. And she, throughout the journey, falsely asserted
that she suffered pain in her limbs, from a strain produced by falling
in her terror at the elephant, and so avoided even touching her
husband. A passionate woman, like a female snake, terrible from the
condensed venom she accumulates within, will never, if
injured<span class="corr" id="xd27e6692" title="Not in source">,</span>
neglect to wreak her vengeance. And in course of time we reached the
city of Lohanagara, where was the house of the husband of that woman,
who lived by trading. And we all remained during that day in a temple
outside the walls. And there I met my friend this second
Br&aacute;hman. And though we had never met before, we felt a
confidence in one another at first sight; the heart of creatures
recognises friendships formed in a previous birth. Then I told him all
my secret. When he heard it, he said to me of his own accord;
&lsquo;Keep the matter quiet, I know of a device by which you can
attain the object for which you came here; I know here the sister of
this lady&rsquo;s husband. She is ready to fly from this place with me,
and take her wealth with her. So with her help I will accomplish your
object for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Br&aacute;hman had said this to me, he departed, and
secretly informed the merchant&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s sister-in-law of
the whole matter. And on the next day the sister-in-law, according to
arrangement, came with her brother&rsquo;s wife and introduced her into
the temple. And while we were there, she made my friend at that very
time, which was the middle of the day, put on the dress of her
brother&rsquo;s wife. And she took him so disguised into the city, and
went into the house in which her brother lived, after arranging what we
were to do. But I left the temple, and fleeing with the
merchant&rsquo;s wife dressed as a man, reached at last this city of
Ujjayin&iacute;. And her sister-in-law at night fled with my friend
from that house, in which there had been a feast, and so the people
were in a drunken sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he came with her by stealthy journeys to this city;
so we met here. In this way we two have obtained our two wives in the
bloom of youth, the sister-in-law and her brother&rsquo;s wife, who
bestowed themselves on us out of affection. Consequently, king, we are
afraid to dwell anywhere; for whose mind is at ease after performing
deeds of reckless temerity? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href=
"#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>So the king saw us yesterday from
a distance, while we were debating about a place to dwell in, and how
we should subsist. And your majesty, seeing us, had us brought and
thrown into prison on the suspicion of being thieves, and to-day we
have been questioned about our history, and I have just told it; now it
is for your highness to dispose of us at pleasure.&rdquo; When one of
them had said this, the king Vikramasinha said to those two
Br&aacute;hmans,&mdash;&ldquo;I am satisfied, do not be afraid, remain
in this city, and I will give you abundance of wealth.&rdquo; When the
king had said this, he gave them as much to live on as they wished, and
they lived happily in his court accompanied by their wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus prosperity dwells for men even in questionable deeds, if
they are the outcome of great courage, and thus kings, being satisfied,
take pleasure in giving to discreet men who are rich in daring. And
thus this whole created world with the gods and demons will always reap
various fruits, corresponding exactly to their own stock of deeds good
or bad, performed in this or in a former birth. So rest assured, queen,
that the flame which was seen by you falling from heaven in your dream,
and apparently entering your womb, is some creature of divine origin,
that owing to some influence of its works has been conceived in
you.&rdquo; The pregnant queen T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, when she
heard this from the mouth of her own husband Kalingadatta, was
exceedingly delighted.</p>

oppressed with the burden of her unborn child. And she, now that her

child against evil spirits, blazing with oil,<a class="noteref" id=

eclipsed by her beauty, and darkened, as if through grief that a son of

when he saw her born, beautiful though she was, <span class=

filled with despondency at the disappointment of his hope to obtain a
son like her. Though he divined that she was of heavenly origin, he was
grieved because he longed for a son. For a son, being embodied joy, is
far superior to a daughter, that is but a lump of grief. Then in his
affliction, the king went out of his palace to divert his mind, and he
entered a monastery full of many images of Buddha. In a certain part of
the monastery, he heard this speech being uttered by a begging hermit,
who was a religious preacher, as he sat in the midst of his
hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that the bestowal of wealth in this world is great
asceticism; a man who gives wealth is said to give life, for life
depends on wealth. And Buddha, with mind full of pity, offered up
himself for another, as if he were worthless straw, much more should
one offer up sordid pelf. And it was by such resolute asceticism, that
Buddha, having got rid of desire, and obtained heavenly insight,
attained the rank of a Buddha. Therefore a wise man should do what is
beneficial to other beings, by abstaining from selfish aspirations even
so far as to sacrifice his own body, in order that he may obtain
perfect insight.&rdquo;</p>

disgusted with the world, and he, though young and handsome, adopted
the life of a wandering hermit. Once on a time that beggar entered the
house of a certain merchant, and was beheld by his young wife with his
eyes long as the leaf of a lotus. She, with heart captivated by the
beauty of his eyes said to him, &ldquo;How came such a handsome man as
you to undertake such a severe vow as this? Happy is the woman who is
gazed upon with this eye of yours!&rdquo; When the begging hermit was
thus addressed by the lady, he tore out one eye, and holding it in his
hand, said, &ldquo;Mother, behold this eye, such as it is; take the
loathsome mass of flesh and blood, if it pleases <span class=

said, &ldquo;Alas! I, unhappy wretch that I am, have done an evil deed,
in that I have become the cause of the tearing out of your eye!&rdquo;

<h3 class="main">Story of the ascetic who conquered anger.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived long ago, in a certain beautiful garden on
the banks of the Ganges, a hermit animated by the desire of
experiencing all asceticism. And while he was engaged in mortifying the
flesh, it happened that a certain king came there to amuse himself with
the women of his harem. And after he had amused himself, he fell asleep
under the influence of his potations, and while he was in this state,
his queens left him out of thoughtlessness and roamed about in the
garden. And beholding in a corner of the garden that hermit engaged in
meditation, they stood round him out of curiosity, wondering what on
earth he could be. And as they remained there a long time, that king
woke up, and not seeing his wives at his side, wandered all round the
garden. And then he saw the queens standing all round the hermit, and
being enraged, he slashed the hermit with his sword out of jealousy.
What crime will not sovereign power, jealousy, cruelty, drunkenness,
and indiscretion cause separately, much more deadly are they when
combined, like five fires.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6764src" href=
"#xd27e6764" name="xd27e6764src">5</a> Then the king departed, and
though the hermit&rsquo;s limbs were gashed, he remained free from
wrath; whereupon a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>certain deity appeared and said to
him,&mdash;&ldquo;Great-souled one, if you approve I will slay by my
power that wicked man who did this to you in a passion.&rdquo; When the
hermit heard that, he said, &ldquo;O goddess, say not so, for he is my
helper in virtue, not a harmer of me. For by his favour I have attained
the grace of patience; to whom could I have shown patience, O goddess,
if he had not acted thus towards me? What anger does the wise man shew
for the sake of this perishing body? To shew patience equally with
regard to what is agreeable and disagreeable is to have attained the
rank of Brahm&aacute;.&rdquo; When the hermit said this to the deity,
she was pleased, and after healing the wounds in his limbs, she
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same way as that king was considered a benefactor by
the hermit, you, my mother, have increased my asceticism by causing me
to tear out my eye.&rdquo; Thus spake the self-subduing hermit to the
merchant&rsquo;s wife, who bowed before him, and being regardless of
his body, lovely though it was, he passed on to perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, though our youth be very charming, why should we
cling to this perishable body? But the only thing which, in the eye of
the wise man, it is good for, is to benefit one&rsquo;s
fellow-creatures. So we will lay down our bodies to benefit living
creatures in this cemetery, the natural home of happiness.&rdquo;
Having said this to their attendants, those seven princesses did so,
and obtained therefrom the highest beatitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus you see that the wise have no selfish affection even for
their own bodies, much less for such worthless things<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6775src" href="#xd27e6775" name="xd27e6775src">6</a> as son,
wife, and servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king Kalingadatta had heard these and other such things
from the religious teacher in the monastery, having spent the day
there, he returned to his palace. And when he was there, he was again
afflicted with grief on account of the birth of a daughter to him, and
a certain Br&aacute;hman, who had grown old in his house, said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;King, why do you despond on account of the birth of a
pearl of maidens? Daughters are better even than sons, and produce
happiness in this world and the next. Why do kings care so much about
those sons that hanker after their kingdom, and eat up their fathers
like crabs? But kings like Kuntibhoja and others, by the virtues of
daughters like <span class="corr" id="xd27e6780" title=
"Source: Kunti">Kunt&iacute;</span> and others, have escaped harm from
sages like the terrible Durv&aacute;sas. And how can one obtain from a
son the same fruit in the next world, as one obtains from the marriage
of a daughter? Moreover I now proceed to tell the tale of
Sulochan&aacute;, listen to it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Sulochan&aacute; and Sushena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a young king named Sushena on the mountain
of Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a, who was created like another god of love by
the Creator to spite &#346;iva. He made at the foot of that great
mountain a heavenly garden, which was calculated to make the gods
averse to dwelling in the garden of Nandana. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>And
in the middle of it he made a lake with full-blown lotuses, like a new
productive bed for the lotuses with which the goddess of Fortune plays.
This lake had steps leading down into it made of splendid gems, and the
king used to linger on its bank without a bride, because there were no
eligible matches for him. Once on a time Rambh&aacute;, a fair one of
heaven, came that way, wandering at will through the air from the
palace of Indra. She beheld the king roaming in that garden like an
incarnation of the Spring in the midst of a garden of full-blown
flowers. She said&mdash;&ldquo;Can this be the moon, that has swooped
down from heaven in pursuit of the goddess of Fortune fallen into a
cluster of lotuses of the lake? But that cannot be, for this
hero&rsquo;s fortune in the shape of beauty never passes away.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6790src" href="#xd27e6790" name="xd27e6790src">7</a>
Surely this must be the god of the flowery arrows come to the garden in
quest of flowers. But where has Rati, his companion, gone?&rdquo; Thus
Rambh&aacute; described him in her eagerness, and descending from
heaven in human form, she approached that king. And when the king
suddenly beheld her advancing towards him, he was astonished and
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Who can this be of incredible beauty? She cannot
surely be a human being, since her feet do not touch the dust, and her
eye does not wink, therefore she must be some divine person. But I must
not ask her who she is, for she might fly from me. Divine beings, who
visit men for some cause or other, are generally impatient of having
their secrets revealed.&rdquo; While such thoughts were passing in the
monarch&rsquo;s mind, she began a conversation with him, which led in
due course to his throwing his arms round her neck then and there. And
he sported long there with this Apsaras, so that she forgot heaven;
love is more charming than one&rsquo;s native home. And the land of
that king was filled with heaps of gold, by means of the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;s, friends of hers, who transformed themselves
into trees, as the heaven is filled with the peaks of Meru. And in
course of time that excellent Apsaras became pregnant, and bore to king
Sushena an incomparably beautiful daughter, and no sooner had she given
her birth, than she said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;O king, such has been
my curse, and it is now at an end; for I am Rambh&aacute;, a heavenly
nymph that fell in love with you on beholding you: and as I have given
birth to a child, I must immediately leave you and depart. For such is
the law that governs us heavenly beings; therefore take care of this
daughter; when she is married, we shall again be united in
heaven.&rdquo; When the Apsaras Rambh&aacute; had said this, she
departed, sorely against her will, and through grief at it, the king
was bent on abandoning life. But his ministers said to him, &ldquo;Did
Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra, though despondent, abandon life when
Menak&aacute; had departed after giving birth to
&#346;akuntal&aacute;?&rdquo; When the king had been plied by them with
such arguments, he took the right view of the matter, and slowly
recovered his self-command, taking to his heart <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>the
daughter who was destined to be the cause of their re-union. And that
daughter, lovely in all her limbs, her father, who was devoted to her,
named Sulochan&aacute;, on account of the exceeding beauty of her
eyes.</p>
<p>In time she grew up to womanhood, and a young hermit, named Vatsa,
the descendant of Ka&#347;yapa, as he was roaming about at will, beheld
her in a garden. He, though he was all compact of asceticism, the
moment he beheld that princess, felt the emotion of love, and he said
to himself then and there; &ldquo;Oh! exceedingly wonderful is the
beauty of this maiden! If I do not obtain her as a wife, what other
fruit of my asceticism can I obtain?&rdquo; While thinking thus, the
young hermit was beheld by Sulochan&aacute;, and he seemed to her all
glorious with brightness, like fire free from smoke. When she saw him
with his rosary and water vessel, she fell in love also and
thought&mdash;&ldquo;Who can this be that looks so self-restrained and
yet so lovely?&rdquo; And coming towards him as if to select him for
her husband, she threw over his body the garland<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6797src" href="#xd27e6797" name="xd27e6797src">8</a> of the blue
lotuses of her eyes, and bowed before that hermit. And he, with mind
overpowered by the decree of Cupid, hard for gods and Asuras to evade,
pronounced on her the following blessing&mdash;&ldquo;Obtain a
husband.&rdquo; Then the excellent hermit was thus addressed by that
lady, whose modesty was stolen away by love for his exceeding beauty,
and who spoke with downcast face&mdash;&ldquo;If this is your desire,
and if this is not jesting talk, then, Br&aacute;hman, ask the king, my
father, who has power to dispose of me.&rdquo; Then the hermit, after
hearing of her descent from her attendants, went and asked the king
Sushena, her father, for her hand. He, for his part, when he saw that
the young hermit was eminent both in beauty and asceticism, entertained
him, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Reverend sir, this daughter is mine
by the nymph Rambh&aacute;, and by my daughter&rsquo;s marriage I am to
be re-united with her in heaven; so Rambh&aacute; told me when she was
returning to the sky; consider, auspicious sir, how that is to be
accomplished.&rdquo; When the hermit heard that, he thought for a
moment&mdash;&ldquo;Did not the hermit Ruru, when Pramadvar&aacute; the
daughter of Menak&aacute; was bitten by a snake, give her the half of
his life, and make her his wife? Was not the
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la Tri&#347;anku carried to heaven by
Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra? So why should not I do the same by expending my
asceticism upon it?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Having thus reflected, the hermit
said&mdash;&ldquo;There is no difficulty in it,&rdquo; and
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Hearken ye gods, may this king mount with his
body to heaven to obtain possession of Rambh&aacute; by virtue of part
of my asceticism.&rdquo; Thus the hermit spoke in the hearing of the
court, and a distinct answer was heard from heaven&mdash;&ldquo;So be
it.&rdquo; Then the king gave his daughter Sulochan&aacute; to the
hermit Vatsa, the descendant of Ka&#347;yapa, and ascended to heaven.
There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>he obtained a divine nature, and lived happily
with that Rambh&aacute; of god-like dignity, appointed his wife by
Indra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, O king, Sushena obtained all his ends by means of a
daughter. For such daughters become incarnate in the houses of such as
you. And this daughter is surely some heavenly nymph, fallen from her
high estate owing to a curse, and born in your house, so do not grieve,
monarch, on account of her birth.&rdquo; When king Kalingadatta had
heard this tale from the Br&aacute;hman that had grown old in his
house, he left off being distressed, and was comforted. And he gave to
his dear young daughter, who gave pleasure to his eyes, as if she had
been a digit of the moon, the name of Kalingasen&aacute;. And the
princess Kalingasen&aacute; grew up in the house of her father amongst
her companions. And she sported in the palaces, and in the
palace-gardens, like a wave of the sea of infancy that is full of the
passion<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6807src" href="#xd27e6807" name=
"xd27e6807src">9</a> for amusement.</p>
<p>Once on a time the daughter of the Asura Maya, named
Somaprabh&aacute;, as she was journeying through the sky, saw her on
the roof of a palace engaged in play. And Somaprabh&aacute;, while in
the sky, beheld her lovely enough to bewilder with her beauty the mind
even of a hermit, and feeling affection for her,
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this? Can she be the form of the moon? If
so, how is it that she gleams in the day? But if she is Rati, where is
K&aacute;ma? Therefore I conclude that she is a mortal maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be some celestial nymph that has descended into a
king&rsquo;s palace in consequence of a curse; and I am persuaded I was
certainly a friend of her&rsquo;s in a former life. For my mind&rsquo;s
being full of exceeding affection for her, tells me so. Therefore it is
fitting that I should again select her as my chosen friend.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting Somaprabh&aacute; descended invisible from heaven, in order
not to frighten that maiden; and she assumed the appearance of a mortal
maiden to inspire confidence, and slowly approached that
Kalingasen&aacute;. Then Kalingasen&aacute;, on beholding her,
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Bravo! here is a princess of wonderful beauty
come to visit me of her own accord! she is a suitable friend for
me.&rdquo; So she rose up politely and embraced that Somaprabh&aacute;.
And making her take a seat, she asked her immediately her descent and
name. And Somaprabh&aacute; said to her; &ldquo;Be patient, I will tell
you all.&rdquo; Then in the course of their conversation they swore
friendship to each other with plighted hands. Then Somaprabh&aacute;,
said&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, you are a king&rsquo;s daughter, and it is
hard to keep up friendship with the children of kings. For they fly
into an immoderate passion on account of a small fault. Hear, with
regard to this point, the story of the prince and the merchant&rsquo;s
son which I am about to tell you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Story of the prince and the merchant&rsquo;s son who
saved his life.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6821src" href="#xd27e6821"
name="xd27e6821src">10</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute; there was a
king named G&uacute;&#7693;hasena, and to him there was born one son.
That prince was overbearing, and whatever he did, right or wrong, his
father acquiesced in, because he was an only son. And once upon a time,
as he was roaming about in a garden, he saw the son of a merchant,
named Brahmadatta, who resembled himself in wealth and beauty. And the
moment he saw him, he selected him for his special friend, and those
two, the prince and the merchant&rsquo;s son, immediately became like
one another in all things.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6847src" href=
"#xd27e6847" name="xd27e6847src">11</a> And soon they were not able to
live without seeing one another, for intimacy in a former birth quickly
knits friendship. The prince never tasted food that was not first
prepared for that merchant&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Once on a time the prince set out for Ahichchhatra in order to be
married, having first decided on his friend&rsquo;s marriage. And, as
he was journeying with his troops, in the society of that friend,
mounted on an elephant, he reached the bank of the Ikshuvat&iacute;,
and encamped there. There he had a wine-party, when the moon arose; and
after he had gone to bed, he began to tell a story at the solicitation
of his nurse. When he had begun his story, being tired and intoxicated
he was overcome by sleep, and his nurse also, but the merchant&rsquo;s
son kept awake out of love for him. And when the others were asleep,
the merchant&rsquo;s son, who was awake, heard in the air what seemed
to be the voices of women engaged in conversation. The first
said&mdash;&ldquo;This wretch has gone to sleep without telling his
tale, therefore I pronounce this curse on him. To-morrow morning he
shall see a necklace, and if he take hold of it, it shall cling to his
neck, and that moment cause his death.&rdquo; Then the first voice
ceased, and the second went on: &ldquo;And if he escape that peril, he
shall see a mango-tree, and if he eat the fruit of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>it,
he shall then and there lose his life.&rdquo; Having uttered this, that
voice also ceased, and then the third said&mdash;&ldquo;If he escape
this also, then, if he enter a house to be married, it shall fall on
him and slay him.&rdquo; Having said so much, that voice also ceased,
and the fourth said, &ldquo;If he escape this also, when he enters that
night into his private apartments, he shall sneeze a hundred times; and
if some one there does not a hundred times say to him, &lsquo;God bless
you,&rsquo; he shall fall into the grasp of death. And if the person,
who has heard all this, shall inform him of it in order to save his
life, he also shall die,&rdquo; having said this, the voice
ceased.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6854src" href="#xd27e6854" name=
"xd27e6854src">12</a> And the merchant&rsquo;s son having heard all
this, terrible as a thunderstroke, being agitated on account of his
affection for the prince, reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Beshrew this tale that
was begun, and not finished, for divinities have come invisible to hear
it, and are cursing him out of disappointed curiosity. And if this
prince dies, what good will my life do to me? So I must by some
artifice deliver my friend whom I value as my life. And I must not tell
him what has taken place, lest I too should suffer.&rdquo; Having thus
reflected, the merchant&rsquo;s son got through the night with
difficulty.</p>
<p>And in the morning the prince set out with him on his journey, and
he saw a necklace in front of him, and wished to lay hold of it. Then
the merchant&rsquo;s son said, &ldquo;Do not take the necklace, my
friend, it is an illusion, else why do not these soldiers see
it?&rdquo; When the prince heard that, he let the necklace alone, but
going on further he saw a mango-tree, and he felt a desire to eat its
fruit. But he was dissuaded by the merchant&rsquo;s son, as before. He
felt much annoyed in his heart, and travelling on slowly he reached his
father-in-law&rsquo;s palace. And he was about to enter a building
there for the purpose of being married, but just as his friend had
persuaded him not to do so, the house fell down. So he escaped this
danger by a hair&rsquo;s breadth, and then he felt some confidence in
his friend&rsquo;s prescience. Then the prince and his wife entered at
night another building. But the merchant&rsquo;s son slipped in there
unobserved. And the prince, when he went to bed, sneezed a hundred
times, but the merchant&rsquo;s son underneath it said a hundred
times&mdash;&ldquo;God bless you&rdquo;&mdash;and then the
merchant&rsquo;s son, having accomplished his object, of his own accord
left the house in high spirits. But the prince, who was with his wife,
saw him going out, and through jealousy, forgetting his love for him,
he flew into a passion and said to the sentinels at his gate:
&ldquo;This designing wretch has entered my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>private apartments when I wished to be alone, so
keep him in durance for the present, and he shall be executed in the
morning.&rdquo; When the guards heard that, they put him under arrest,
and he spent the night in confinement, but as he was being led off to
execution in the morning, he said to them&mdash;&ldquo;First take me
into the presence of the prince, in order that I may tell him a certain
reason, which I had for my conduct; and then put me to death.&rdquo;
When he said this to the guards, they went and informed the prince, and
on their information and the advice of his ministers, the prince
ordered him to be brought before him. When he was brought, he told the
prince the whole story, and he believed it to be true, for the fall of
the house carried conviction to his mind. So the prince was satisfied,
and countermanded the order for his friend&rsquo;s execution, and he
returned with him to his own city, a married man. And there his friend
the merchant&rsquo;s son married, and lived in happiness, his virtues
being praised by all men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the children of kings break loose from restraint and
slaying their guides, disregard benefits, like infuriated
elephants<span class="corr" id="xd27e6865" title=

Vet&aacute;las, who take people&rsquo;s lives by way of a joke.
Therefore, my princess, never abandon your friendship with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kalingasen&aacute; heard this story in the palace from the
mouth of Somaprabh&aacute;, she answered her affectionate
friend,&mdash;&ldquo;Those of whom you speak are considered
Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, not the children of kings, and I will tell you a
story of the evil importunity of Pi&#347;&aacute;chas,

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman and the <span class="corr"
id="xd27e6876" title=
"Source: Pis&aacute;cha">Pi&#347;&aacute;cha</span>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there was a Br&aacute;hman dwelling on a
royal grant, which was called Yajnasthala. He once upon a time, being
poor, went to the forest to bring home wood. There, a piece of wood
being cleft with the axe, fell, as chance would have it, upon his leg,
and piercing it, entered deep into it. And as the blood flowed from
him, he fainted, and he was beheld in that condition by a man who
recognised him, and taking him up carried him home. There his
distracted wife washed off the blood, and consoling him, placed a
plaster upon the wound. And then his wound, though tended day by day,
not only did not heal, but formed an ulcer. Then the man, afflicted
with his ulcerated wound, poverty-stricken, and at the point of death,
was thus advised in secret by a Br&aacute;hman friend, who came to him;
&ldquo;A friend of mine, named Yajnadatta, was long very poor, but he
gained the aid of a Pi&#347;&aacute;cha by a charm, and so, having
obtained wealth, lived in happiness. And he told me that charm, so do
you gain, my friend, by means of it, the aid of a Pi&#347;&aacute;cha;
he will heal your wound.&rdquo; Having said this, he told him the form
of words and described to him the ceremony as follows: &ldquo;Rise up
in the last watch of the night, and with dishevelled hair and naked,
and without rinsing your mouth, take two handfuls of rice as large as
you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>can grasp with your two hands, and muttering the
form of words go to a place where four roads meet, and there place the
two handfuls of rice, and return in silence without looking behind you.
Do so always until that Pi&#347;&aacute;cha appears, and himself says
to you, &lsquo;I will put an end to your ailment.&rsquo; Then receive
his aid gladly, and he will remove your complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his friend had said this to him, the Br&aacute;hman did as he
had been directed. Then the Pi&#347;&aacute;cha, being conciliated,
brought heavenly herbs from a lofty peak of the Him&aacute;layas and
healed his wound. And then he became obstinately persistent, and said
to the Br&aacute;hman, who was delighted at being healed, &ldquo;Give
me a second wound to cure, but if you will not, I will do you an injury
or destroy your body.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he was
terrified, and immediately said to him to get rid of him&mdash;&ldquo;I
will give you another wound within seven days.&rdquo; Whereupon the
Pi&#347;&aacute;cha left him, but the Br&aacute;hman felt hopeless
about his life. But eventually he baffled the Pi&#347;&aacute;cha by
the help of his daughter, and having got over the disease, he lived in
happiness.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6885src" href="#xd27e6885" name=
"xd27e6885src">14</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Such are Pi&#347;&aacute;chas, and some young princes are
just like them, and, though conciliated, produce misfortune, my friend,
but they can be guarded against by counsel. But princesses of good
family have never been heard to be such. So you must not expect any
injury from associating with me.&rdquo; When Somaprabh&aacute; heard
from the mouth of <span class="corr" id="xd27e6896" title=
"Source: Kaling&aacute;sen&aacute;">Kalingasen&aacute;</span> in due
course this sweet, entertaining, and amusing tale, she was delighted.
And she said to her&mdash;&ldquo;My house is sixty <i>yojanas</i>
distant hence, and the day is passing away; I have remained long, so
now I must depart, fair one.&rdquo; Then, as the lord of day was slowly
sinking to the eastern mountain, she took leave of her friend who was
eager for a second interview, and in a moment flew up into the air,
exciting the wonder of the spectators, and rapidly returned to her own
house. And, after beholding that wonderful sight, Kalingasen&aacute;
entered into her house with much perplexity, and reflected, &ldquo;I do
not know, indeed, whether my friend is a Siddha female, or an Apsaras,
or a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;. She is certainly a heavenly female that
travels through the upper air. And heavenly females associate with
mortal ones led by excessive love. Did not Arundhat&iacute; live in
friendship with the daughter of king P&#7771;ithu? Did not P&#7771;ithu
by means of her friendship bring Surabhi from heaven to earth. And did
not he by consuming its milk return to heaven though he had fallen from
it. And were not thenceforth perfect cows born upon earth? So I am
fortunate; it is by good luck that I have obtained this heavenly
creature as a friend; and when she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>comes to-morrow I will
dexterously as her her descent and name.&rdquo; Thinking such thoughts
in her heart, Kalingasen&aacute; spent that night there, and
Somaprabh&aacute; spent the night in her own house being eager to
behold her again.</p>

<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Shortly after that came a certain
nobleman unto Dubthach to ask for his daughter in marriage. Dubthach
and his sons were willing, but Brigit refused. Said a brother of her
brethren named Becc&aacute;n unto her: &lsquo;Idle is the fair eye that
is in thy head not to be on a pillow near a husband.&rsquo; &lsquo;The
son of the Virgin knoweth&rsquo; said Brigit, &lsquo;it is not lively
for us if it brings harm upon us.&rsquo; Then Brigit put her finger
under her eye and drew it out of her head till it was on her cheek; and
she said: &lsquo;Lo, here is thy delightful eye, O
Becc&aacute;n.&rsquo; Then his eye burst forthwith. When Dubthach and
his brethren saw that, they promised that she should never be told to
go to a husband. Then she put her palm to her eye and it was whole at

of the faithful servant V&iacute;ravara in the Hitopade&#347;a, which
is also found in the Vet&aacute;lapanchavin&#347;ati, (see chapter 78
of this work.) V&iacute;ravara, according to the account in the
Vet&aacute;lapanchavin&#347;ati, hears the weeping of a woman. He finds
it is the king&rsquo;s fortune deserting him. He accordingly offers up
his son, and finally slays himself. The king is about to do the same
when the goddess Durg&aacute; restores the dead to life. The story of
&ldquo;Der Treue Johannes&rdquo; will at once occur to readers of
Grimm&rsquo;s tales. According to Benfey, it is also found in the
Pentamerone of Basile. The form of the tale in our text is very similar
to that in Grimm. (See Benfey&rsquo;s Panchatantra, Vol. I, p. 416.)
The story of the faithful V&iacute;ravara occurs twice in this
collection, in chapter 53, and also in chapter 78. Sir G. Cox (in his
Aryan Mythology, Vol. I p. 148), compares the German story with one in
Miss Frere&rsquo;s Old Deccan Days, the 5th in that collection. Other
parallels will be found in the notes in Grimm&rsquo;s third volume.

parallel will be found in Bernhard Schmidt&rsquo;s <span lang=

the three Moirai predict evil. The young prince is saved by his sister,

<p class="first">Then in the morning Somaprabh&aacute; took with her a
basket, in which she had placed many excellent mechanical dolls of wood
with magic properties in order to amuse her friend, and travelling
through the air she came again to Kalingasen&aacute;. And when
Kalingasen&aacute; saw her, she was full of tears of joy, and rising up
she threw her arms round her neck, and said to her, as she sat by her
side&mdash;&ldquo;The dark night of three watches has this time seemed
to me to be of a hundred watches without the sight of the full moon of
your countenance. So, if you know, my friend, tell me of what kind may

said to that princess: &ldquo;Such knowledge I do not possess, for I do
not remember my former birth; and hermits are not acquainted with this,
but if any know, they are perfectly acquainted with the highest truth,
and they are the original founders of the science by which it is
attained.&rdquo; When she had spoken thus, Kalingasen&aacute;, being
full of curiosity, again asked her in private in a voice tender from
love and confidence, &ldquo;Tell me, friend, of what divine father you
have adorned the race by your birth, since you are completely virtuous

href="#xd27e6909" name="xd27e6909src">1</a> And what, auspicious one,
is your name, that is nectar to the ears of the world. What is the
object of this basket? And what thing is there in it?&rdquo; On hearing
this affectionate speech from Kalingasen&aacute;, Somaprabh&aacute;
began to tell the whole story in due course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a mighty Asura of the name of Maya, famous in the
three worlds. And he, abandoning the condition of an Asura, fled to
&#346;iva as his protector. And &#346;iva having promised him security,
he built the palace of Indra. But the Daityas were angry with him,
affirming that he had become a partizan of the gods. Through fear of
them he made in the Vindhya mountains a very wonderful magic
subterranean palace, which the Asuras could not reach. My sister and I
are the two daughters of that Maya. My elder sister named
Svayamprabh&aacute; follows a vow of virginity, and lives as a maiden
in my father&rsquo;s house. But I, the younger daughter, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>named Somaprabh&aacute;, have been bestowed in
marriage on a son of Kuvera named Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara, and my
father has taught me innumerable magic artifices, and as for this
basket, I have brought it here to please you.&rdquo; Having said this,
Somaprabh&aacute; opened the basket and shewed to her some very
interesting mechanical dolls constructed by her magic, made of wood.
One of them, on a pin in it being touched,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6918src" href="#xd27e6918" name="xd27e6918src">2</a> went through
the air at her orders and fetched a garland of flowers and quickly
returned. Another in the same way brought water at will;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6921src" href="#xd27e6921" name="xd27e6921src">3</a>
another danced, and another then conversed. With such very wonderful
contrivances Somaprabh&aacute; amused Kalingasen&aacute; for some time,
and then she put that magic basket in a place of security, and taking
leave of her regretful friend, she went, being obedient to her husband,
through the air to her own palace. But Kalingasen&aacute; was so
delighted that the sight of these wonders took away her appetite, and
she remained averse to all food. And when her mother perceived that,
she feared she was ill; however a physician named &Aacute;nanda having
examined the child, told her mother that there was nothing the matter
with her. He said, &ldquo;She has lost her appetite through delight at
something, not from disease; for her countenance, which appears to be
laughing, with eyes wide open, indicates this.&rdquo; When she heard
this report from the physician, the girl&rsquo;s mother asked her the
real cause of her joy; and the girl told her. Then her mother believed
that she was delighted with the society of an eligible friend, and
congratulated her, and made her take her proper food.</p>
<p>Then the next day Somaprabh&aacute; arrived, and having found out
what had taken place, she proceeded to say to Kalingasen&aacute; in
secret, &ldquo;I told my husband, who possesses supernatural knowledge,
that I had formed a friendship with you, and obtained from him, when he
knew the facts, permission to visit you every day. So you must now
obtain permission from your parents, in order that you may amuse
yourself with me at will without fear.&rdquo; When she had said this,
Kalingasen&aacute; took her by the hand, and immediately went to her
father and mother, and there introduced her friend to her father, king
Kalingadatta, proclaiming her descent and name, and in the same way she
introduced her to her mother T&aacute;r&aacute;datt&aacute;, and they,
on beholding her, received her politely in accordance with their
daughter&rsquo;s account of her. And both those two, pleased with her
appearance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>hospitably received that beautiful wife of the
distinguished Asura out of love for their daughter, and said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Dear girl, we entrust this Kalingasen&aacute; to your
care, so amuse yourselves together as much as you please.&rdquo; And
Kalingasen&aacute; and Somaprabh&aacute; having gladly welcomed this
speech of theirs, went out together. And they went, in order to amuse
themselves, to a temple of Buddha built by the king. And they took
there that basket of magic toys. Then Somaprabh&aacute; took a magic
Yaksha, and sent it on a commission from herself to bring the
requisites for the worship of Buddha. That Yaksha went a long distance
through the sky, and brought a multitude of pearls, beautiful gems, and
golden lotuses. Having performed worship with these, Somaprabh&aacute;
exhibiting all kinds of wonders, displayed the various Buddhas with
their abodes. When the king Kalingadatta heard of that, he came with
the queen and beheld it, and then asked Somaprabh&aacute; about the
magic performance. Then Somaprabh&aacute; said, &ldquo;King, these
contrivances of magic machines, and so on, were created in various ways
by my father in old time. And even as this vast machine, called the
world, consists of five elements, so do all these machines: I will
describe them one by one. That machine, in which earth predominates,
shuts doors and things of the kind. Not even Indra would be able to
open what had been shut with it. The shapes produced by the
water-machine appear to be alive. But the machine in which fire
predominates, pours forth flames. And the wind-machine performs
actions, such as going and coming. And the machine produced from ether
utters distinct language. All these I obtained from my father, but the
wheel-machine, which guards the water of immortality, my father knows
and no one else.&rdquo; While she was saying this, there arose the
sound of conchs being blown in the middle of the day, that seemed to
confirm her words. Then she entreated the king to give her the food
that suited her, and taking Kalingasen&aacute; as a companion, by
permission of the king she set out through the air for her
father&rsquo;s house in a magic chariot, to return to her elder sister.
And quickly reaching that palace, which was situated in the Vindhya
mountains, she conducted her to her sister Svayamprabh&aacute;. There
Kalingasen&aacute; saw that Svayamprabh&aacute; with her head encircled
with matted locks, with a long rosary, a nun clothed in a white
garment, smiling like P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, in whom love, the highest
joy of earth, had undertaken a severe vow of mortification. And
Svayamprabh&aacute;, when the princess, introduced by
Somaprabh&aacute;, kneeled before her, received her hospitably and
entertained her with a meal of fruits. And Somaprabh&aacute; said to
the princess: &lsquo;My friend, by eating these fruits, you will escape
old age which otherwise would destroy this beauty, as the nipping cold
does the lotus: and it was with this object that I brought you here out
of affection.<span class="corr" id="xd27e6931" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> Then that Kalingasen&aacute; ate those
fruits, and immediately her limbs seemed to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>bathed in the water of life. And roaming about
there to amuse herself, she saw the garden of the city, with tanks
filled with golden lotuses, and trees bearing fruit as sweet as nectar:
the garden was full of birds of golden and variegated plumage, and
seemed to have pillars of bright gems; it conveyed the idea of walls
where there was no partition, and where there were partitions, of
unobstructed space. Where there was water, it presented the appearance
of dry land, and where there was dry land, it bore the semblance of
water. It resembled another and a wonderful world, created by the
delusive power of the Asura Maya. It had been entered formerly by the
monkeys searching for S&iacute;t&aacute;, which, after a long time,
were allowed to come out by the favour of Svayamprabh&aacute;. So
Svayamprabh&aacute; bade her adieu, after she had been astonished with
a full sight of her wonderful city, and had obtained immunity from old
age; and Somaprabh&aacute; making Kalingasen&aacute; ascend the chariot
again, took her through the air to her own palace in
Taksha&#347;il&aacute;. There Kalingasen&aacute; told the whole story
faithfully to her parents, and they were exceedingly pleased.</p>
<p>And while those two friends spent their days in this way,
Somaprabh&aacute; once upon a time said to Kalingasen&aacute;:
&ldquo;As long as you are not married, I can continue to be your
friend, but after your marriage, how could I enter the house of your
husband? For a friend&rsquo;s husband ought never to be seen or
recognised<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6938src" href="#xd27e6938" name=
"xd27e6938src">4</a>; * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>As for a mother-in-law she eats the flesh of a daughter-in-law as a
she-wolf does of a sheep. And <i>&agrave; propos</i> of this, hear the
story of K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; which I am about to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in the city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a merchant named, not without cause,
Dhanap&aacute;lita,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6956src" href=
"#xd27e6956" name="xd27e6956src">6</a> for he was the richest of the
rich. And there was born to him a daughter, named
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, who was incomparably beautiful, and dearer to
him than life. And he took his daughter to Magadha and married her to a
rich merchant, named Devasena. And though Devasena was himself very
virtuous, he had a wicked mother as mistress in his house, for his
father was dead. She, when she saw that her daughter-in-law
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; was beloved by her husband, being inflamed with
anger, ill-treated her in her husband&rsquo;s absence. But
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; was afraid to let her husband know it, for the
position of a bride in the power of a treacherous mother-in-law is a
difficult one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time her husband Devasena, instigated by his relations,
was preparing to go to the city of Vallabh&iacute; for the sake of
trade. Then that K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; said to her
husband,&mdash;&ldquo;I have not told you for this long time what I am
now going to say: your mother ill-treats me though you are here, but I
do not know what she will do to me when you are in a foreign
country.&rdquo; When Devasena heard that, he was perplexed, and being
alarmed on account of his affection for his wife, he went and humbly
said to his mother&mdash;&ldquo;K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; is committed to
your care, mother, now that I am going to a foreign land; you must not
treat her unkindly, for she is the daughter of a man of good
family.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When
Devasena&rsquo;s mother heard that, she summoned
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, and elevating her eyes, said to him then and
there,&mdash;&ldquo;What have I done? ask her. This is the way in which
she eggs you on, my son, trying to make mischief in the house, but both
of you are the same in my eyes.&rdquo; When the good merchant heard
that, he departed with his mind easy on her account. For who is not
deceived by the hypocritically affectionate speeches of a mother? But
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; stood there silent, smiling in bewilderment,
and the next day the merchant set out for Vallabh&iacute;. Then, when
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; began to suffer torture at being separated from
her husband, the merchant&rsquo;s mother gradually forbade the female
slaves to attend on her. And making an agreement with a handmaid of her
own, that worked in the house, she took K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; inside
and secretly stripped her. And saying to her, &ldquo;Wicked woman, you
rob me of my son,&rdquo; she pulled her hair, and with the help of her
servant, mangled her with kicks, bites, and scratches. And she threw
her into a cellar that was closed with a trap-door and strongly
fastened, after first taking out all the things that were in it
previously. And the wretch put in it every day half a plate of rice, in
the evening, for the girl who was in such a state. And she thought,
&ldquo;I will say in a few days &lsquo;she died of herself during her
husband&rsquo;s absence in a distant land, take her corpse
away.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6967src" href=
"#xd27e6967" name="xd27e6967src">7</a> Thus K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;,
who deserved all happiness, was thrown into a cellar by that cruel
mother-in-law, and while there she reflected with tears, &ldquo;My
husband is rich, I was born in a good family, I am fortunately endowed
and virtuous, nevertheless I suffer such calamity, thanks to my
mother-in-law. And this is why relations lament the birth of a
daughter, exposed to the terrors of mother-in-law, and sister-in-law,
marred with inauspiciousness of every kind.&rdquo; While thus
lamenting, K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; suddenly found a small shovel in
that cellar, like a thorn extracted from her heart by the Creator. So
she dug a passage underground with that iron instrument, until by good
luck she rose up in her own private apartment. And she was able to see
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>room by the light of a lamp that had been left
there before, as if she were lighted by her own undiminished virtue.
And she took out of it her clothes and her gold, and leaving it
secretly at the close of the night, she went out of the city. She
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;It is not fitting that I should go to my
father&rsquo;s house after acting thus; what should I say there, and
how would people believe me? So I must manage to repair to my husband
by means of my own ingenuity; for a husband is the only refuge of
virtuous women in this world and the next.&rdquo; Reflecting thus, she
bathed in the water of a tank, and put on the splendid dress of a
prince. Then she went into the bazar and after exchanging some gold for
money, she sojourned that day in the house of a certain merchant.</p>
<p>The next day she struck up a friendship with a merchant named
Samudrasena who wished to go to Vallabh&iacute;. And wearing the
splendid dress of a prince, she set out for Vallabh&iacute; with the
merchant and his servants in order to catch up her husband who had set
out beforehand. And she said to that merchant, &ldquo;I am oppressed by
my clansmen,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6986src" href="#xd27e6986"
name="xd27e6986src">8</a> so I will go with you to my friends in
Vallabh&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having heard that, the merchant&rsquo;s son waited upon her on the
journey, out of respect, thinking to himself that she was some
distinguished prince or other; and that caravan preferred for its march
the forest road, which was much frequented by travellers, who avoided
the other routes because of the heavy duties they had to pay. In a few
days they reached the entrance of the forest, and while the caravan was
encamped in the evening, a female jackal, like a messenger of death,
uttered a terrific howl. Thereupon the merchants, who understood what
that meant, became apprehensive of an attack by bandits, and the guards
on every side took their arms in hand; and the darkness began to
advance like the vanguard of the bandits; then K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;,
in man&rsquo;s dress, beholding that, reflected, &ldquo;Alas! the deeds
of those who have sinned in a former life seem to propagate themselves
with a brood of evils! Lo! the calamity which my mother-in-law brought
upon me has borne fruit here also! First I was engulphed by the wrath
of my mother-in-law as if by the mouth of death, then I entered the
cellar like a second prison of the womb. By good fortune, I escaped
thence, being, as it were, born a second time, and having come here, I
have again run a risk of my life. If I am slain here by bandits, my
mother-in-law, who hates me, will surely say to my husband, &lsquo;She
ran off somewhere being attached to another man.&rsquo; But if some one
tears off my clothes and recognises me <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>for a woman, then
again I run a risk of outrage, and death is better than that. So I must
deliver myself, and disregard this merchant my friend. For good women
must regard the duty of virtuous wives, not friends and things of that
kind.&rdquo; Thus she determined, and searching about, found a hollow
like a house in the middle of a tree, as it were, an opening made for
her by the earth out of pity. There she entered and covered her body
with leaves and such like things; and remained supported by the hope of
reunion with her husband. Then, in the dead of night, a large force of
bandits suddenly fell upon the caravan with uplifted weapons, and
surrounded it on all sides. And there followed a storm of fight, with
howling bandits for thunder-clouds, and the gleam of weapons for
long-continued lightning-flashes, and a rain of blood. At last the
bandits, being more powerful, slew the merchant-prince Samudrasena and
his followers, and went off with all his wealth.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; was listening to the
tumult, and that she was not forcibly robbed of breath is to be
ascribed to fate only. Then the night departed, and the keen-rayed sun
arose, and she went out from that hollow in the middle of the tree.
Surely the gods themselves preserve in misfortune good women
exclusively devoted to their husbands, and of unfailing virtue; for not
only did a lion beholding her in the lonely wood spare her, but a
hermit that had come from somewhere or other, when she asked him for
information, comforted her and gave her a drink of water from his
vessel, and then disappeared in some direction or other, after telling
her the road to take. Then satisfied as if with nectar, free from
hunger and thirst, that woman, devoted to her husband, set out by the
road indicated by the hermit. Then she saw the sun mounted on the
western mountain, stretching forth his rays like fingers, as if
saying&mdash;&ldquo;Wait patiently one night&rdquo;&mdash;and so she
entered an opening in the root of a forest tree which looked like a
house, and closed its mouth with another tree. And in the evening she
saw through the opening of a chink in the door of her retreat a
terrible R&aacute;kshas&iacute; approaching, accompanied by her young
sons. She was terrified, thinking to herself&mdash;&ldquo;Lo! I shall
be devoured by this R&aacute;kshas&iacute; after escaping all my other
misfortunes&rdquo;&mdash;and in the meanwhile the
R&aacute;kshas&iacute; ascended that tree. And her sons ascended after
her, and immediately said to that R&aacute;kshas&iacute;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6997src" href="#xd27e6997" name=
"xd27e6997src">9</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, give us something to
eat.&rdquo; Then the R&aacute;kshas&iacute; said to her
children,&mdash;&ldquo;To-day, my children, I went to a great cemetery,
but I did not obtain any food, and though I entreated the congregation
of witches, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>gave me no portion; then grieved thereat I
appealed to &#346;iva in his terrific form and asked him for food. And
the god asked me my name and lineage, and then said to
me&mdash;&lsquo;Terrible one, thou art of high birth as belonging to
the race of Khara and D&uacute;sha&#7751;a;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7024src" href="#xd27e7024" name="xd27e7024src">10</a> so go to
the city of Vasudatta, not far from here. In that city there lives a
great king named Vasudatta addicted to virtue; he defends this whole
forest, dwelling on its border, and himself takes duties and chastises
robbers. Now, one day, while the king was sleeping in the forest,
fatigued with hunting, a centipede quickly entered his ear unobserved.
And in course of time it gave birth to many others inside his head.
That produced an illness which now dries up all his sinews. And the
physicians do not know what is the cause of his disease, but if some
one does not find out, he will die in a few days. When he is dead, eat
his flesh; for by eating it, you will, thanks to your magic power,
remain satiated for six months!&rsquo; In these words &#346;iva
promised me a meal, that is attended with uncertainty, and cannot be
obtained for a long time, so what must I do, my children?&rdquo; When
the R&aacute;kshas&iacute; said this to her children, they asked her,
&ldquo;If the disease is discovered and removed, will that king live,
mother? And tell us how such a disease can be cured in him?&rdquo; When
the children said this, the R&aacute;kshas&iacute; solemnly said to
them, &ldquo;If the disease is discovered and removed, the king will
certainly live. And hear how his great disease may be taken away. First
his head must be anointed by rubbing warm butter on it, and then it
must be placed for a long time in the heat of the sun intensified by
noonday. And a hollow cane-tube must be inserted into the aperture of
his ear, which must communicate with a hole in a plate, and this plate
must be placed above a pitcher of cool water. Accordingly the
centipedes will be annoyed by heat and perspiration, and will come out
of his head, and will enter that cane-tube from the aperture of the
ear, and desiring coolness will fall into the pitcher. In this way the
king may be freed from that great disease.&rdquo; Thus spake the
R&aacute;kshas&iacute; to her sons on the tree, and then ceased; and
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, who was in the trunk of the tree, heard it.
And hearing it, she said to herself, &ldquo;If ever I get safe away
from here, I will go and employ this artifice to save the life of that
king. For he takes but small duties, and dwells on the outskirts of
this forest; and so all the merchants come this way because it is more
convenient. This is what the merchant, Samudrasena, who is gone to
heaven, told me; accordingly that husband of mine will be sure to
return by this very path. So I will go to the city of Vasudatta, which
is on the borders of the forest, and I will deliver the king from his
sickness, and there await the arrival of my husband.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting, she managed, though with difficulty, to get through the
night: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>in the morning, the R&aacute;kshasas having
disappeared, she went out from the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>Then she travelled along slowly in the dress of a man, and in the
afternoon she saw a good cowherd. He was moved to compassion by seeing
her delicate beauty, and that she had accomplished a long journey, and
then she approached him, and said&mdash;&ldquo;What country is this,
please tell me?&rdquo; The cowherd said&mdash;&ldquo;This city in front
of you is the city of Vasudatta, belonging to the king Vasudatta: as
for the king, he lies there at the point of death with illness.&rdquo;
When K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; heard that, she said to the cowherd,
&ldquo;If any one will conduct me into the presence of that king, I
know how to remove his disease.&rdquo; When the cowherd heard that, he
said, &ldquo;I am going to that very city, so come with me, that I may
point it out to you.&rdquo; K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;
answered&mdash;&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and immediately that herdsman
conducted her to the city of Vasudatta, wearing her male dress. And
telling the circumstances exactly as they were, he immediately
commended that lady with auspicious marks to the afflicted warder. And
the warder, having informed the king, by his orders introduced the
blameless lady into his presence. The king Vasudatta, though tortured
with his disease, was comforted the moment he beheld that lady of
wonderful beauty; the soul is able to distinguish friends from enemies.
And he said to the lady who was disguised as a man, &ldquo;Auspicious
sir, if you remove this disease, I will give you half my kingdom; I
remember a lady stripped off from me in my dream a black blanket, so
you will certainly remove this my disease.&rdquo; When
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; heard that, she said&mdash;&ldquo;This day is
at an end, O king; to-morrow I will take away your disease; do not be
impatient.&rdquo; Having said this, she rubbed cow&rsquo;s butter on
the king&rsquo;s head; that made sleep come to him, and the excessive
pain disappeared. And then all there praised K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;This is some god come to us in the disguise of a
physician, thanks to our merits in a previous state of
existence.&rdquo; And the queen waited on her with various attentions,
and appointed for her a house in which to rest at night, with female
attendants. Then on the next day, at noon, before the eyes of the
ministers and ladies of the harem, K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; extracted
from the head of that king, through the aperture of the ear, one
hundred and fifty centipedes, by employing the wonderful artifice
previously described by the R&aacute;kshas&iacute;. And after getting
the centipedes into the pitcher, she comforted the king by fomenting
him with milk and melted butter. The king having gradually recovered,
and being free from disease, everybody there was astonished at
beholding those creatures in the pitcher. And the king, on beholding
these harmful insects that had been extracted from his head, was
terrified, puzzled and delighted, and considered himself born again.
And he made high feast, and honoured K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, who did
not care for half the kingdom, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>with villages, elephants,
horses, and gold. And the queens and the ministers loaded her with gold
and garments, saying that they ought to honour the physician who had
saved the life of their sovereign. But she deposited for the present
that wealth in the hand of the king, waiting for her husband, and
saying&mdash;&ldquo;I am under a vow for a certain time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; remained there some days in man&rsquo;s
clothes, honoured by all men, and in the meanwhile she heard from the
people that her own husband, the great merchant Devasena, had come that
way from Vallabh&iacute;. Then, as soon as she knew that that caravan
had arrived in the city, she went to it, and saw that husband of hers
as a peahen beholds the new cloud. And she fell at his feet, and her
heart, weeping from the pain of long separation, made her bestow on him
the <i lang="sa-latn">argha</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e7037src"
href="#xd27e7037" name="xd27e7037src">11</a> with her tears of joy. Her
husband, for his part, after he had examined her, who was concealed by
her disguise, like the form of the moon invisible in the day on account
of the rays of the sun, recognised her. It was wonderful that the heart
of Devasena, who was handsome as the moon, did not dissolve like the
moonstone,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7046src" href="#xd27e7046" name=
"xd27e7046src">12</a> on beholding the moon of her countenance.</p>
<p>Then, K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; having thus revealed herself, and her
husband remaining in a state of wonder, marvelling what it could mean,
and the company of merchants being astonished, the king Vasudatta,
hearing of it, came there full of amazement. And
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, being questioned by him, told in the presence
of her husband her whole adventure, that was due to the wickedness of
her mother-in-law. And her husband Devasena, hearing it, conceived an
aversion to his mother, and was affected at the same time by anger,
forbearance, astonishment, and joy. And all the people present there,
having heard that wonderful adventure of K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;,
exclaimed joyfully&mdash;&ldquo;Chaste women, mounted on the chariot of
conjugal affection, protected by the armour of modesty, and armed with
the weapon of intellect, are victorious in the struggle.&rdquo; The
king too said&mdash;&ldquo;This lady, who has endured affliction for
the sake of her husband, has surpassed even queen S&iacute;t&aacute;,
who shared the hardships of R&aacute;ma. So she is henceforth my sister
in the faith, as well as the saviour of my life.&rdquo; When the king
said that, K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; answered him&mdash;&ldquo;O king,
let your gift of affection which I deposited in your care, consisting
of villages, elephants, and horses, be made over to my husband.&rdquo;
When she said this to the king, he bestowed on her husband Devasena the
villages and other presents, and being pleased gave him a turban of
honour. Then Devasena, having his purse suddenly filled with stores of
wealth, part of which was given by the king, and part acquired by his
own trading, avoiding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>his mother, and praising
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute;, remained dwelling in that town. And
K&iacute;rtisen&aacute; having found a happy lot, from which her wicked
mother-in-law was removed, and having obtained glory by her
unparalleled adventures, dwelt there in the enjoyment of all luxury and
power, like all the rich fruit of her husband&rsquo;s good deeds
incarnate in a body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus chaste women, enduring the dispensations of hostile
fate, but preserving in misfortunes the treasure of their virtue, and
protected by the great power of their goodness, procure good fortune
for their husbands and themselves. And thus, O daughter of a king, many
misfortunes befall wives, inflicted by mothers-in-law and
sisters-in-law, therefore I desire for you a husband&rsquo;s house of
such a kind, that in it there shall be no mother-in-law and no cruel
sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this delightful and marvellous story from the mouth of the
Asura princess Somaprabh&aacute;, the mortal princess
Kalingasen&aacute; was highly delighted<span class="corr" id=

these tales, the matter of which was so various, had come to an end,

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then Kalingasen&aacute; out of love went to the top of
a palace on the high road, to follow with her eyes the course of
Somaprabh&aacute;, who had set out for her own home, and by chance a
young king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Madanavega, travelling
through the air, had a near view of her. The youth beholding her,
bewildering the three worlds with her beauty, like the bunch of peacock
feathers of the conjuror Cupid, was much troubled. He
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Away with the Vidy&aacute;dhara beauties! Not
even the Apsarases deserve to be mentioned in presence of the
surpassing loveliness of this mortal lady. So if she will not consent
to become my wife, what is the profit of my life? But how can I
associate with a mortal lady, being a Vidy&aacute;dhara?&rdquo;
Thereupon he called to mind the science named Prajnapti, and that
science, appearing in bodily form, thus addressed him, &ldquo;She is
not really a mortal woman, she is an Apsaras, degraded in consequence
of a curse, and born in the house of the august king
Kalingadatta.&rdquo; When the Vidy&aacute;dhara had been thus informed
by the science, he went off delighted and distracted with love; and
averse from all other things, reflected in his palace; &ldquo;It is not
fitting for me to carry her off by force; for the possession of women
by force is, according to a curse, fated to bring me death. So in order
to obtain her, I must propitiate &#346;iva by asceticism, for happiness
is procurable by asceticism, and no other expedient presents
itself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>Thus he resolved, and the next day he went to
the &#7770;ishabha mountain, and standing on one foot, performed
penance without taking food. Then the husband of Ambik&aacute; was soon
won over by Madanavega&rsquo;s severe asceticism, and appearing to him,
thus enjoined him, &ldquo;This maiden, named Kalingasen&aacute;, is
famous for beauty on the earth, and she cannot find any husband equal
to her in the gift of loveliness. Only the king of Vatsa is a fitting
match for her, and he longs to possess her, but through fear of
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, does not dare to court her openly. And this
princess, who is longing for a handsome husband, will hear of the king
of Vatsa from the mouth of Somaprabh&aacute;, and repair to him to
choose him as her husband. So, before her marriage takes place, assume
the form of the impatient king of Vatsa, and go and make her your wife
by the G&aacute;ndharva ceremony. In this way, fair sir, you will
obtain Kalingasen&aacute;.&rdquo; Having received this command from
&#346;iva, Madanavega prostrated himself before him, and returned to
his home on the slope of the K&aacute;lak&uacute;&#7789;a mountain.</p>
<p>Then Kalingasen&aacute; went on enjoying herself in the city of
Taksha&#347;il&aacute;, in the society of Somaprabh&aacute;, who went
every night to her own home, and came back every morning to her friend,
in her chariot that travelled through the air: and one day she said to
Somaprabh&aacute; in private; &ldquo;My friend, you must not tell any
one what I tell you. Listen, and I will give you a reason that makes me
think the time of my marriage has arrived. Ambassadors have been sent
here by many kings to ask me in marriage. And they, after an interview
with my father, have always hitherto been dismissed by him as they
came. But now the king of the name of Prasenajit, who lives in
&#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;, has sent a messenger, and he alone has
been received with honourable distinction by my father. And that course
has been recommended by my mother, so I conjecture, the king, my
suitor, has been approved of by my father and mother, as of
sufficiently noble lineage. For he is born in that family, in which
were born Amb&aacute; and Amb&aacute;lik&aacute;, the paternal
grandmothers of the Kurus and P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;us. So, my friend,
it is clear that they have now determined to bestow me in marriage on
this king Prasenajit in the city of &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;.&rdquo;
When Somaprabh&aacute; heard this from Kalingasen&aacute;, she suddenly
shed from grief a copious shower of tears, creating, as it were, a
second necklace. And when her friend asked her the cause of her tears,
that daughter of the Asura Maya, who had seen all the terrestrial
world, said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Of the desirable requisites in a
suitor, youth, good looks, noble birth, good disposition, and wealth,
youth is of the greatest importance; high birth, and so on, are of
subordinate importance. But I have seen that king Prasenajit, and he is
an old man; who cares about his high lineage, as he is old, any more
than about the birth of the jasmine-flower? You will be to be pitied
when linked to him who is white as snow, as the lotus-bed, when linked
to the winter, and your face will be a withered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>lotus. For this reason despondency has arisen in
me, but I should be delighted if Udayana, the king of Vatsa, were to
become your husband, O auspicious lady. For there is no king upon the
earth equal to him in form, beauty, lineage, daring and riches. If,
fair one, you should be married to that fitting mate, the display which
the Creator has made in your case of his power to create beauty, would
have brought forth fruit.&rdquo; By means of these speeches, artfully
framed by Somaprabh&aacute;, the mind of Kalingasen&aacute; was
impelled as if by engines, and flew towards the king of Vatsa. And then
the princess asked the daughter of Maya, &ldquo;Friend, how is it that
he is called the king of Vatsa? In what race was he born? And whence
was he named Udayana? Tell me.&rdquo; Then Somaprabh&aacute;
said&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, friend, I will tell you that. There is a
land, the ornament of the earth, named Vatsa. In it there is a city
named Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, like a second
Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;; and he is called the king of Vatsa because he
rules there. And hear his lineage, my friend, related by me. Arjuna of
the P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;ava race had a son named Abhimanyu, and he,
skilled in breaking the close rings of the hostile army, destroyed the
force of the Kauravas. From him there sprang a king named
Par&iacute;kshit, the head of the race of Bharata, and from him sprang
Janamejaya, who performed the snake-sacrifice. His son was
&#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka who settled in Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;,
and he was slain in a war between the gods and Asuras after slaying
many giants. His son was king Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, an object of
praise to the world, to whom Indra sent his chariot, and he went to
heaven and returned thence. To him was born this Udayana by the queen
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;, the ornament of the race of the Moon, a
king that is a feast to the eyes of the world. Hear too the reason of
his name. That M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;, the mother of this
high-born king, being pregnant, felt a desire to bathe in a lake of
blood, and her husband, afraid of committing sin, had a lake made of
liquid <i>lac</i> and other coloured fluids in which she plunged. Then
a bird of the race of Garu&#7693;a pounced upon her, thinking she was
raw flesh, and carried her off, and, as fate would have it, left her
alive on the mountain of the sunrise. And there the hermit Jamadagni
saw her, and comforted her, promising her reunion with her husband, and
she remained there in his hermitage. For such was the curse inflicted
upon her husband by Tilottam&aacute; jealous on account of his
neglecting her, which caused him separation from his wife for a season.
And in some days she brought forth a son in the hermitage of Jamadagni
on that very mountain of the sunrise, as the sky brings forth the new
moon. And because he was born on the mountain of the sunrise, the gods
then and there gave him the name of Udayana, uttering from heaven this
bodiless voice&mdash;&lsquo;This Udayana, who is now born, shall be
sovereign of the whole earth, and there shall be born to him a son, who
shall be emperor of all the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sahasr&aacute;n&iacute;ka, for his part, who had been
informed of the real state of the case by M&aacute;tali, and had fixed
his hope on the termination of his curse, with difficulty got through
the time without that M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;. But when the curse
had expired, the king obtained his token from a &#346;avara who, as
fate would have it, had come from the mountain of the sunrise. And then
he was informed of the truth by a voice that came from heaven, and
making that &#346;avara his guide, he went to the mountain of the
sunrise. There he found his wife M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute; like the
success of his wishes, and her son Udayana like the realm of fancy.
With them he returned to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, and appointed his
son crown-prince, pleased with the excellence of his qualities; and he
gave him the sons of his ministers, <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
and others. When his son took the burden of the kingdom off his
shoulders, he enjoyed pleasures for a long time in the society of
M&#7771;ig&aacute;vat&iacute;. And in time the king established his
son, that very Udayana, on the throne, and being old, went with his
wife and ministers on the long journey. So, Udayana has obtained that
kingdom that belonged to his father, and having conquered all his
enemies, rules the earth with the help of
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having in these words quickly told her in confidence the story of
Udayana, she again said to her friend
Kalingasen&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;Thus that king is called the king of
Vatsa, fair one, because he rules in Vatsa, and since he comes of the
P&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;ava lineage, he is also descended from the race
of the sun. And the gods gave him the name of Udayana, because he was
born on the mountain of the sunrise, and in this world even the god of
love is not a match for him in beauty. He alone is a husband fit for
you, most beautiful lady of the three worlds, and he, being a lover of
beauty, no doubt longs for you, who are famous for it. But, my friend,
his head-wife is V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, the daughter of
Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena. And she selected him herself,
deserting her relations in the ardour of her passion, and so sparing
the blushes of Ush&aacute;, &#346;akuntal&aacute; and other maidens.
And a son has been born to him by her, called Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
who is appointed by the gods as the future emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. So it is through fear of her that the king of Vatsa
does not send here to ask for your hand, but she has been seen by me,
and she does not vie with you in the gift of beauty.&rdquo; When her
friend Somaprabh&aacute; said this, Kalingasen&aacute;, being in love
with the king of Vatsa, answered her&mdash;&ldquo;I know all this, but
what can I do, as I am under the power of my parents? But in this, you,
who know all things and possess magic power, are my refuge.&rdquo;
Somaprabh&aacute; then said to her&mdash;&ldquo;The whole matter
depends on destiny; in proof of it hear the following tale.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Tejasvat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time there lived in Ujjayin&iacute; a king
named Vikramasena, and he had a daughter named Tejasvat&iacute;,
matchless in beauty. And she disapproved of every king who sued for her
hand. But one day, while she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>was on the roof of her palace, she
saw a man, and as fate would have it, she felt a desire to meet him as
he was very handsome, and she sent her confidante to him, to
communicate to him her desire. The confidante went and entreated the
man, who shrank from such an audacious step, and at last with much
difficulty she made him against his will agree to an assignation,
saying, &ldquo;Await, good sir, the arrival of the princess at night in
this retired temple which you see here.&rdquo; After saying this, she
took leave of him, and went and told the princess Tejasvat&iacute;, who
for her part remained watching the sun. But that man, though he had
consented, fled somewhere else out of fear; a frog is not capable of
relishing the fibres of a bed of red lotuses.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a certain prince of high lineage came, as his
father was dead, to visit the king who had been his father&rsquo;s
friend. And that handsome young prince, named Somadatta, whose kingdom
and wealth had been taken by pretenders, arriving at night, entered by
accident, to pass the night there, that very temple in which the
confidante of the princess had arranged a meeting with the man. While
he was there, the princess, blind with passion, approached him, without
distinguishing who he was, and made him her self-chosen husband. The
wise prince gladly received in silence the bride offered him by fate,
who foreshadowed his union with the future Fortune of Royalty. And the
princess soon perceived that he was very charming, and considered that
she had not been deceived by the Creator. Immediately they conversed
together, and the two separated according to agreement; the princess
went to her own palace, while the king spent the rest of the night
there. In the morning the prince went and announced his name by the
mouth of the warder, and being recognised, entered into the presence of
the king. There he told his sorrow on account of his kingdom having
been taken away, and other insults, and the king agreed to assist him
in overthrowing his enemies. And he determined to give him the daughter
he had long desired to give away, and then and there told his intention
to the ministers. Then the queen told the king his daughter&rsquo;s
adventure, having been informed of it before by herself, through the
mouths of trusty confidantes. Then the king was astonished at finding
that calamity had been averted and his desire attained by mere chance,
as in the fable of the crow and the palm,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7094src" href="#xd27e7094" name="xd27e7094src">1</a> and
thereupon one of the ministers said to the king, &ldquo;Fate watches to
ensure the objects of auspicious persons, as good servants of their
masters, when the latter are not on the look-out. And to illustrate
this, I will tell you the following tale: listen!&rdquo; <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a certain Br&aacute;hman in a certain
village, named Hari&#347;arman.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7104src"
href="#xd27e7104" name="xd27e7104src">2</a> He was poor and foolish and
in evil ease for want of employment, and he had very many children,
that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in a former life. He
wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a
certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called
Sth&uacute;ladatta. He made his sons keepers of this
householder&rsquo;s cows and other possessions, and his wife a servant
to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an
attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the
daughter of Sth&uacute;ladatta, largely attended by many friends of the
bridegroom, and merry-makers. And then Hari&#347;arman entertained a
hope that he would be able to fill himself up to the throat with ghee
and flesh and other dainties, together with his family, in the house of
his patron. While he was anxiously expecting that occasion, no one
thought of him. Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and
he said to his wife at night; &ldquo;It is owing to my poverty and
stupidity that I am treated with such disrespect here: so I will
display by means of an artifice an assumed knowledge, in order that I
may become an object of respect to this Sth&uacute;ladatta, and when
you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess supernatural
knowledge.&rdquo; He said this to her, and after turning the matter
over in his mind, while people were asleep he took away from the house
of Sth&uacute;ladatta a horse on which his son-in-law rode. He placed
it in concealment at some distance, and in the morning the friends of
the bridegroom could not find the horse, though they searched in every
direction. Then, while Sth&uacute;ladatta was distressed at the evil
omen, and searching for the thieves who had carried off the horse, the
wife of Hari&#347;arman came and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My husband is
a wise man, skilled in astrology and sciences of that kind; and he will
procure for you the horse; why do you not ask him?&rdquo; When
Sth&uacute;ladatta heard that, he called that Hari&#347;arman, who
said, &ldquo;Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is
stolen, I am called to mind,&rdquo; and Sth&uacute;ladatta then
propitiated the Br&aacute;hman with these words&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot
you, forgive me&rdquo;&mdash;and asked him to tell him who had taken
away their horse? Then Hari&#347;arman drew all kinds of pretended
diagrams and said,&mdash;&ldquo;The horse has been placed by thieves on
the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and
before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day,
quickly go and bring it.&rdquo; When they heard that, many men ran and
brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Hari&#347;arman.
Then Hari&#347;arman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there
in happiness, honoured by Sth&uacute;ladatta. Then, as days went on,

"pb273">273</a>]</span>wealth consisting of gold and jewels was carried
off by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not known,
the king quickly summoned Hari&#347;arman on account of his reputation
for supernatural knowledge. And he, when summoned, tried to gain time,
and said &ldquo;I will tell you to-morrow,&rdquo; and then he was
placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was
despondent about his pretended knowledge.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7109src" href="#xd27e7109" name="xd27e7109src">3</a> Now in that
palace there was a maid named Jihv&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7118src" href="#xd27e7118" name="xd27e7118src">4</a> who, with
the assistance of her brother had carried off that wealth from the
interior of the palace: she, being alarmed at Hari&#347;arman&rsquo;s
knowledge, went at night and applied her ear to the door of that
chamber in order to find out what he was about. And Hari&#347;arman,
who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming his own tongue,
that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said&mdash;&ldquo;O
Tongue, what is this that you have done, through desire of enjoyment?
Ill-conducted one, endure now punishment in this place.&rdquo; When
Jihv&aacute; heard this, she thought in her terror, that she had been
discovered by this wise man, and by an artifice she managed to get in
where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to that supposed
sage;&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, here I am, that Jihv&aacute; whom
you have discovered to be the thief of the wealth, and after I took it,
I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a
pomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold
which is in my possession.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When Hari&#347;arman heard that, he said
to her proudly, &ldquo;Depart, I know all this; I know the past,
present and future: but I will not denounce you, being a miserable
creature that has implored my protection. But whatever gold is in your
possession you must give back to me.&rdquo; When he said this to the
maid, she consented and departed quickly. But Hari&#347;arman reflected
in his astonishment; &ldquo;Fate, if propitious, brings about, as if in
sport, a thing that cannot be accomplished, for in this matter when
calamity was near, success has unexpectedly been attained by me. While
I was blaming my tongue (<i lang="sa-latn">jihv&aacute;</i>), the thief
Jihv&aacute; suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes I see,
manifest themselves by means of fear<span class="corr" id="xd27e7128"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; In these reflections he passed
the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the
king by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden, and
led him up to the treasure, which was buried there and he said that the
thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the king was pleased and
proceeded to give him villages. But the minister, named
Devajn&aacute;nin, whispered in the king&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;How can a
man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied
treatises; so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>you may be certain that this is a specimen of
the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret
intelligence with thieves. So it will be better to test him by some new
artifice.&rdquo; Then the king of his own accord brought a new covered
pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to that
Hari&#347;arman&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, if you can guess what
there is in this pitcher, I will do you great honour to-day.&rdquo;
When the Br&aacute;hman Hari&#347;arman heard that, he thought that his
last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of frog which
his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and impelled by the
deity he apostrophized himself by it, lamenting his hard fate, and
suddenly exclaimed there&mdash;&ldquo;This is a fine pitcher for you,
frog, since suddenly it has become the swift destroyer of your helpless
self in this place.&rdquo; The people there, when they heard that, made
a tumult of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the
object presented to him, and murmured,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! a great sage,
he knows even about the frog!&rdquo; Then the king, thinking that this
was all due to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave
Hari&#347;arman villages with gold, umbrella, and vehicles of all
kinds. And immediately Hari&#347;arman became like a feudal chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus good objects are brought about by fate for those whose
actions in a former life have been good. Accordingly fate made that
daughter of yours, Tejasvat&iacute;, approach Somadatta a man of equal
birth, and kept away one who was unsuited to her.&rdquo; Hearing this
from the mouth of his minister, the king Vikramasena gave his daughter
to that prince as if she were the goddess of fortune. Then the prince
went and overcame his enemies by the help of his father-in-law&rsquo;s
host, and being established in his own kingdom, lived happily in the
company of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So true is it that all this happens by the special favour of
fate; who on earth would be able to join you, lovely as you are, with
the king of Vatsa, though a suitable match for you, without the help of
fate? What can I do in this matter, friend Kalingasen&aacute;?&rdquo;
Kalingasen&aacute;, hearing this story in private from the mouth of
Somaprabh&aacute;, became eager in her soul for union with the king of
Vatsa, and, in her aspirations after him, began to feel in a less
degree the fear of her relations and the warnings of modesty. Then, the
sun, the great lamp of the three worlds, being about to set,
Somaprabh&aacute; the daughter of the Asura Maya, having with
difficulty taken leave, until her morning return, of her friend, whose
mind was fixed upon her proposed attempt, went through the air to her
own home.</p>

<h3 class="main">Note on the story of <span class="corr" id="xd27e7140"
title="Source: Haris&aacute;rman">Hari&#347;arman</span>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of Hari&#347;arman resembles closely that of
<span lang="de">Doctor Allwissend</span> in Grimm&rsquo;s Tales. It is
shown by Benfey to exist in various forms in many countries. It is
found in the Siddhik&uuml;r, the Mongolian form of the Sanskrit
Vet&aacute;lapanchavin&#347;ati. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>this form of the
story the incident of the frog in the pot is omitted, and the other
incidents are considerably altered. Instead of the king&rsquo;s
treasure we find a magic gem, on which the prosperity of the country
depends; it is not stolen but lost by the king&rsquo;s daughter.
Instead of the horse we have the cure of a sick Kh&aacute;n who had
been driven mad by evil spirits. The folly of the man who represents
the Br&aacute;hman consists in his choosing worthless presents for his
reward. (The story is the IVth in Sagas from the Far East.) Benfey
considers the fullest form of the story to be that in
Schleicher&rsquo;s Lithuanian Legends. In this form of the story we
have the stealing of the horse. In other points it resembles the
Mongolian version. The Br&aacute;hman is represented by a poor
cottager, who puts up over his door a notice saying that he is a
Doctor, who knows everything and can do everything. The third exploit
of the cottager is the finding of a stolen treasure which is the second
in the Indian story, but his second is a miraculous cure which is in
accordance with the Siddik&uuml;r. The latter is probably a late work;
and we may presume that the Mongols brought the Indian story to Europe,
in a form resembling that in the Kath&aacute; Sarit S&aacute;gara more
nearly than the form in the Siddik&uuml;r does. In the third exploit of
the cottager in the Lithuanian tale, which corresponds to the second in
the Indian, the treasure has been stolen by three servants. They listen
outside while the Doctor is alone in his room. When the clock strikes
one,&mdash;he says, &ldquo;We have one.&rdquo; When it strikes two, he
says&mdash;&ldquo;We have two.&rdquo; When it strikes three, he
says,&mdash;&ldquo;We have now three.&rdquo; In their terror they go to
the doctor and beg him not to betray them. He is richly rewarded.</p>
<p>But after all, Grimm&rsquo;s form of the tale is nearest to the
Sanskrit. The dish with crabs in it, the contents of which the Doctor
has to guess, makes him exclaim&mdash;&rdquo;<i lang="de">Ach ich armer
Krebs</i>.&rdquo; This might almost have been translated from the
Sanskrit; it is so similar in form. The guilty servants, who stole the
gold are detected by the Doctor&rsquo;s saying to his
wife&mdash;&ldquo;Margaret, that is the first&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the
first who waited at table, and so on.</p>
<p>The story is also found in the Faceti&aelig; of Henricus Bebelius,
1506. Here a poor charcoal-burner represents the Br&aacute;hman. He
asks three days to consider. The king gives him a good dinner, and
while the first thief is standing at the window, he exclaims
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Jam unus accessit</i>&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;one day
is at an end.&rdquo; The next day the second thief comes to listen. The
charcoal-burner exclaims &ldquo;<i lang="la">Secundus
accessit</i>&rdquo; and so with the third, whereupon they all
confess.</p>
<p>Benfey conceives himself to have found the incident of the horse in
Poggii Faceti&aelig; (LXXXVI ed. Cracov. 1592, p. 59). Here a doctor
boasts a wonder-working pill. A man who has lost his ass takes one of
these pills. It conducts him to a bed of reeds where he finds his ass.

<h3 class="main">Story of Ush&aacute; and Aniruddha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Asura B&aacute;&#7751;a had a daughter, famous
under the name of Ush&aacute;. And she propitiated Gaur&iacute;, who
granted her a boon in order that she might obtain a husband, saying to
her, &ldquo;He to whom you shall be united in a dream, shall be your
husband.&rdquo; Then she saw in a dream a certain man looking like a
divine prince. She was married by him according to the G&aacute;ndharva
form of marriage, and after obtaining the joy of union with him, she
woke up at the close of night. When she did not see the husband she had
seen in her dream, but beheld the traces of his presence, she
remembered the boon of Gaur&iacute;, and was full of disquietude, fear,
and astonishment. And being miserable without the husband whom she had
seen in her dream, she confessed all to her friend Chitralekh&aacute;,
who questioned her. And Chitralekh&aacute;, being acquainted with
magic, thus addressed that Ush&aacute;, who knew not the name of her
lover nor any sign whereby to recognise him,&mdash;&ldquo;My friend,
this is the result of the boon of the goddess Gaur&iacute;, what doubt
can we allege in this matter? But how are you to search for your lover
as he is not to be recognised by any token? I will sketch for you the
whole world, gods, Asuras, and men, in case you may be able to
recognise him;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7183src" href="#xd27e7183"
name="xd27e7183src">1</a> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"
href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>point him out to me among
them, in order that I may bring him.&rdquo; Thus spoke
Chitralekh&aacute;, and when Ush&aacute; answered &ldquo;By all
means!&rdquo; she painted for her with coloured pencils the whole world
in order. Thereupon Ush&aacute; exclaimed joyfully, &ldquo;There he
is,&rdquo; and pointed out with trembling finger Aniruddha in
Dv&aacute;ravat&iacute; of the race of Yadu. Then Chitralekh&aacute;
said&mdash;&ldquo;My friend, you are fortunate, in that you have
obtained for a husband Aniruddha the grandson of the adorable
Vish&#7751;u. But he lives sixty thousand <i>yojanas</i> from
here.&rdquo; When Ush&aacute; heard that, she said to her, overpowered
by excessive longing, &ldquo;Friend, if I cannot to-day repair to his
bosom cool as sandal wood, know that I am already dead, being burnt up
with the uncontrollable fire of love.&rdquo; When Chitralekh&aacute;
heard this, she consoled her dear friend, and immediately flew up and
went through the air to the city of Dv&aacute;ravat&iacute;; and she
beheld it in the middle of the sea, producing with its vast and lofty
palaces an appearance as if the peaks of the churning mountain<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7199src" href="#xd27e7199" name="xd27e7199src">2</a>
had again been flung into the ocean<span class="corr" id="xd27e7202"
title="Not in source">.</span> She found Aniruddha asleep in that city
at night, and woke him up, and told him that Ush&aacute; had fallen in
love with him on account of having seen him in a dream. And she took
the prince, who was eager for the interview, looking exactly as he had
before appeared in Ush&aacute;&rsquo;s dream, and returned from
Dv&aacute;ravat&iacute; in a moment by the might of her magic. And
flying with him through the air, she introduced that lover secretly
into the private apartments of Ush&aacute;, who was awaiting him. When
Ush&aacute; beheld that Aniruddha arrived in bodily form, resembling
the moon, there was a movement in her limbs resembling the tide of the
sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7206src" href="#xd27e7206" name=
"xd27e7206src">3</a> Then she remained there with that sweet-heart who
had been given her by her friend, in perfect happiness, as if with Life
embodied in visible form. But her father B&aacute;&#7751;a, when he
heard it, was angry; however Aniruddha conquered him by his own valour
and the might of his grandfather. Then Ush&aacute; and Aniruddha
returned to Dv&aacute;ravat&iacute; and became inseparable like
&#346;iva and P&aacute;rvat&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7211src" href="#xd27e7211" name="xd27e7211src">4</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus Chitralekh&aacute; united Ush&aacute; with her lover in
one day, but I consider you, my friend, far more powerful than her. So
bring me the king of Vatsa here, do not delay.&rdquo; When
Somaprabh&aacute; heard this from Kalingasen&aacute;, she
said&mdash;&ldquo;Chitralekh&aacute;, a nymph of heaven, might take up
a strange man and bring him, but what can one like myself do in the
matter, who never touch any man but my husband? So I will take you, my
friend, to the place where the king of Vatsa is, having first shewn you
your suitor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>Prasenajit.&rdquo; When Somaprabh&aacute; made
this proposal to Kalingasen&aacute;, she consented, and immediately
ascended with her the magic chariot prepared by her, and setting out
through the air with her treasures and her retinue, she went off
unknown to her parents. For women impelled by love regard neither
height nor depth in front of them, as a horse urged on by his rider
does not fear the keenest sword-edge.</p>
<p>First she came to &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;, and beheld from a
distance the king Prasenajit white with age, who had gone out to hunt,
distinguished by a <i>chouri</i> frequently waved, which seemed at a
distance to repel her as if saying&mdash;&ldquo;Leave this old
man.&rdquo; And Somaprabh&aacute; pointed him out with a scornful
laugh, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Look! this is the man to whom your father
wishes to give you.&rdquo; Then she said to
Somaprabh&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;Old age has chosen him for her own, what
other female will choose him?&rdquo; &ldquo;So take me away from here
quickly, my friend, to the king of Vatsa.&rdquo; Immediately
Kalingasen&aacute; went with her to the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; through the air. Then she beheld from a
distance with eagerness that king of Vatsa, pointed out by her friend
in a garden, as the female partridge beholds the nectar-rayed moon.
With dilated eye, and hand placed on the heart, she seemed to say
&ldquo;He has entered my soul by this path.&rdquo; Then she exclaimed,
&ldquo;Friend, procure me a meeting here with the king of Vatsa this
very day; for having seen him I am not able to wait a moment.&rdquo;
But when she said this, her friend Somaprabh&aacute; answered
her&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen to-day an unfavourable omen, so remain, my
friend, this day quiet and unobserved in this garden, do not, my
friend, send go-betweens backwards and forwards. To-morrow I will come
and devise some expedient for your meeting: at present, O thou whose
home is in my heart, I desire to return to the home of my
husband.&rdquo; Having said this, Somaprabh&aacute; departed thence
after leaving her there; and the king of Vatsa, leaving the garden,
entered his palace. Then Kalingasen&aacute;, remaining there, sent her
chamberlain, giving him her message explicitly, to the king of Vatsa;
and this she did, though previously forbidden by her friend, who
understood omens. Love, when recently enthroned in the breasts of young
women, is impatient of all restraint. And the chamberlain went and
announced himself by the mouth of the warder, and immediately entering,
thus addressed the king of Vatsa&mdash;&ldquo;O king, the daughter of
Kalingadatta the king who rules over Taksha&#347;il&aacute;,
Kalingasen&aacute; by name, having heard that you are most handsome,
has come here to choose you for a husband, abandoning her relatives,
having accomplished the journey in a magic car that travels through the
air, together with her attendants; and she has been conducted here by
her confidante named Somaprabh&aacute;, who travels invisible, the
daughter of the Asura Maya, the wife of Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara. I have
been sent by her to inform you; do you receive her; let there be union
of you two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>as of the moonlight and the moon.&rdquo; When
the king heard this from the chamberlain, he welcomed him,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; and being delighted, he honoured
him with gold and garments. And summoning his chief minister
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
he said to him, &ldquo;The daughter of king Kalingadatta, who is called
Kalingasen&aacute;, and whose beauty is famed on the earth, has come of
her own accord to choose me as a husband; so tell me quickly, when
shall I marry her, for she is not to be rejected?&rdquo; The minister
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
when the king of Vatsa said this to him, regarding what would be best
for his master in the long run, reflected for a moment as
follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7231src" href="#xd27e7231" name=
"xd27e7231src">5</a> &ldquo;Kalingasen&aacute; is certainly famed for
beauty in the three worlds, there is no other like her; even the gods
are in love with her. If this king of Vatsa obtain her, he will abandon
everything else, and then the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; will lose
her life, and then the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta will perish, and
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; out of love for him will find life hard to
retain: and then Cha&#7751;&#7693;amah&aacute;sena and Pradyota, the
fathers of the two queens, will lose their lives or become hostile; and
thus utter ruin will follow. On the other hand it will not do to forbid
the match, since the vicious passion of this king will increase if he
is thwarted. So I will put off the time of his marriage in order to
attain a favourable issue.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, <span class=
"corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
said to the king of Vatsa, &ldquo;O king, you are fortunate in that
this Kalingasen&aacute; has of her own accord come to your house, and
the king, her father, has become your servant. So you must consult the
astrologers, and marry her in accordance with good custom at an
auspicious time, for she is the daughter of a great king. To-day give
her a suitable palace to dwell in by herself, and send her male and
female slaves, and robes and ornaments.&rdquo; When his chief minister
gave him this advice, the king of Vatsa approved it, and with glad
heart performed it all with special attention. Then Kalingasen&aacute;
entered the palace assigned her for residence, and considering her
desire attained, was exceedingly delighted.</p>
<p>The wise <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
for his part, immediately left the king&rsquo;s court, went to his own
house, and reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Often procrastination serves to avert
an inauspicious measure. For long ago, when Indra had fled on account
of having caused the death of a Br&aacute;hman, and Nahusha obtained
the sovereignty over the gods, he fell in love with
&#346;ach&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7249src" href=
"#xd27e7249" name="xd27e7249src">6</a> and she was saved by the
preceptor of the gods<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7252src" href=
"#xd27e7252" name="xd27e7252src">7</a>, to whom she had fled for
refuge. For in order to gain time, he kept saying&mdash;&lsquo;She will
come to you to-day or to-morrow,&rsquo;&mdash;until Nahusha was
destroyed by the curse of a Br&aacute;hman, uttered with an angry roar,
and Indra regained the sovereignty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280"
href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>of the gods. In the same way
I must keep putting off my master.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the
minister secretly made an arrangement with the astrologers that they
were to fix a distant date.</p>
<p>Then the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; found out what had taken
place, and summoned the prime-minister to her palace. When he entered
and bowed before her, the queen said to him, weeping&mdash;&ldquo;Noble
sir, you said to me long ago, &lsquo;Queen, as long as I remain where I
am, you shall have no other rival but Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;,&rsquo;
and observe now, this Kalingasen&aacute; is about to be married here:
and she is beautiful, and my husband is attached to her, so you have
proved a prophet of falsehood and I am now a dead woman.&rdquo; When
the minister <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
heard this, he said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Be composed, for how could this
happen, queen, while I am alive? However, you must not oppose the king
in this matter, but must on the contrary take refuge in self-restraint,
and shew him all complaisance. The sick man is not induced to place
himself in the physician&rsquo;s hands by disagreeable speeches, but he
is by agreeable speeches, if the physician does his work by a
conciliatory method. If a man is dragged against the current, he will
never escape from the stream of a river, or from a vicious tendency,
but if he is carried with the current, he will escape from both. So
when the king comes into your presence, receive him with all
attentions, without anger, concealing your real feelings. Approve at
present of his marrying Kalingasen&aacute;, saying that his kingdom
will be made more powerful by her father also becoming his ally. And if
you do this, the king will perceive that you possess in a high degree
the virtue of magnanimity, and his love and courtesy towards you will
increase, and thinking that Kalingasen&aacute; is within his reach, he
will not be impatient, for the desire of a man for any object increases
if he is restrained. And you must teach this lesson to
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; also, O blameless one, and so that king may
submit to our putting him off in this matter. And after this, I ween,
you will behold my skill in stratagem. For the wise are tested in
difficulty, even as heroes are tested in fight. So, queen, do not be
despondent.&rdquo; In these words <span class="corr" title=

admonished the queen, and, as she received his counsels with respect,
he departed thence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7267src" href=

throughout that day, neither in light nor darkness entered the private
apartments of either of the two queens, for his mind was eager for a
new well-matched union with Kalingasen&aacute;, who had approached him
in such an ardour of spontaneous choice. And then the queen and the
prime-minister and the king and Kalingasen&aacute; spent the night in
wakefulness like that of a great feast, apart in their respective
houses, the second couple through impatience for a rare delight, and
the first through very profound anxiety. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then the artful minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
came the next morning to the king of Vatsa, who was expecting him, and
made the following representation&mdash;&ldquo;O king, why do you not
immediately enquire about an auspicious moment for celebrating the
happy marriage of your highness with Kalingasen&aacute;, the daughter
of Kalingadatta, the king of Taksha&#347;il&aacute;?&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="n281.1src" href="#n281.1" name="n281.1src">1</a> When the
king heard that, he said&mdash;&ldquo;The same desire is fixed in my
heart, for my mind cannot endure to remain a moment without
her<span class="corr" id="xd27e7289" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; Having said this, the simple-hearted
monarch gave orders to a warder, who stood before him, and summoned the
astrologers. When he questioned them, they, having had their cue
previously given them by the prime minister, said, &ldquo;For the king
there will be a favourable moment in six months from this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a heard this, he pretended to be
angry, and the cunning fellow said to the king, &ldquo;Out on these
blockheads! That astrologer, whom your highness previously honoured on
the ground of his cleverness, has not come to-day, ask him, and then do
what is proper<span class="corr" id="xd27e7294" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; When he heard this speech of his
minister&rsquo;s, the king of Vatsa immediately summoned that very
astrologer with mind in an agony of suspense. He also stuck to his
agreement, and in order to put off the day of the marriage he named
when asked, after some reflection, a moment six months off. Then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a pretending to be
distracted, said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;Let your majesty command what
is to be done in this matter!&rdquo; The king, being impatient and
longing for a favourable moment, said, after
reflecting&mdash;&ldquo;You must ask Kalingasen&aacute;, and see what
she says.&rdquo; When Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a heard this, he took
with him two astrologers and went into the presence of
Kalingasen&aacute;. She received him politely, and beholding her
beauty, he reflected&mdash;&ldquo;If the king were to obtain her, he
would abandon the whole kingdom in his reckless passion.&rdquo; And he
said to her, &ldquo;I am come with these astrologers to fix the moment
of your marriage; so let these servants inform me of the particular
star in the lunar mansions under which you were born.&rdquo; When the
astrologers heard the lunar mansion stated by her attendants, they
pretended to investigate the matter, and kept saying in the course of
their calculations, &ldquo;It is not on this side, it must be after
that.&rdquo; At last, in accordance with their agreement with the
minister, they named again that very moment at the end of six months.
When Kalingasen&aacute; heard that distant date fixed, she was cast
down in spirit, but her chamberlain said, &ldquo;You must first fix a
favourable moment, so that this couple may be happy all their lives,
what matters it whether it be near or far off?&rdquo; When they heard
this speech of the chamberlain&rsquo;s, all there immediately
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Well said.&rdquo; And
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a said, &ldquo;Yes, and if an inauspicious
moment is appointed for us, the king Kalingadatta, our proposed
connexion, will be grieved.&rdquo; Then Kalingasen&aacute;, being
helpless, said to them all&mdash;&ldquo;Let it be as you appoint in
your wisdom&rdquo;&mdash;and remained silent. And at once accepting
that speech of hers, Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a took leave of her,
and went with the astrologers into the presence of the king. Then he
told the proceedings to the king of Vatsa, exactly as they had
happened, and so having settled his mind by an artifice, he went to his
own house.</p>
<p>So having attained his object of putting off the marriage, in order
to complete the scheme he had in view, he called to mind his friend,
the Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa, named Yoge&#347;vara. He, according
to his previous promise, when thought of, readily came to the minister,
and bowed before him and said&mdash;&ldquo;Why am I called to
mind?&rdquo; Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a told him the whole
incident of Kalingasen&aacute; which was tempting his master to vice,
and again said to him&mdash;&ldquo;I have managed to gain time, my
friend; in that interval, do you, remaining concealed, observe by your
skill the behaviour of Kalingasen&aacute;. For the Vidy&aacute;dharas
and other spirits are without doubt secretly in love with her, since
there is no other woman in the three worlds equal to her in beauty. So,
if she were to have an intrigue with some Siddha or Vidy&aacute;dhara,
and you were to see it, it would be a fortunate thing. And you must
observe the divine lover, though he come disguised, when he is asleep,
for divine beings, when asleep, assume their own form. If in this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>way we are able to discover any offence in her
by means of your eyes, the king will be disgusted with her, and will
accomplish that object of ours.&rdquo; When the minister said this to
him, the <span class="corr" id="xd27e7303" title=
"Source: Br&aacute;hman-Rakshasa">Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa</span>
answered, &ldquo;Why should I not by some artifice cause her to fall or
slay her?&rdquo; When the great minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a
heard that, he said to him&mdash;&ldquo;This must not be done, for it
would be a very wicked deed. And whoever goes his own way without
offending against the god of justice, finds that that god comes to his
assistance to enable him to attain his objects. So you must discover in
her, my friend, a fault self-caused, in order that through your
friendship the king&rsquo;s objects may be accomplished by me.&rdquo;
Having received this order from the excellent minister, the
Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa departed, and disguised by magic entered
the house of Kalingasen&aacute;.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Somaprabh&aacute;, her friend, the daughter of the
Asura Maya, went again into the presence of Kalingasen&aacute;. And the
daughter of Maya, after asking her friend what had happened in the
night, said to her who had abandoned her relations, in the hearing of
that R&aacute;kshasa&mdash;&ldquo;I came here in the forenoon after
searching for you, but I remained concealed at your side, seeing
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a. However I heard your conversation, and I
understood the whole state of affairs. So why did you make this attempt
yesterday though you were forbidden to do so by me? For any business
which is undertaken, my friend, without first counteracting the evil
omen, will end in calamity; as a proof of this, hear the following
tale:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son
Vish&#7751;udatta and his seven foolish companions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived in Antarvedi a Br&aacute;hman
named Vasudatta, and he had a son born to him named Vish&#7751;udatta.
That Vish&#7751;udatta, after he reached the age of sixteen years, set
out for the city of Vallabh&iacute; in order to acquire learning. And
there joined him seven other young Br&aacute;hmans his fellows, but
those seven were fools, while he was wise and sprung from a good
family. After they had taken an oath not to desert one another,
Vish&#7751;udatta set out with them at night without the knowledge of
his parents. And after he had set forth, he saw an evil omen presenting
itself in front of him, and he said to those friends of his who were
travelling with him,&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! Here is a bad omen! it is
advisable to turn back now; we will set out again with good hope of
success, when we have auspicious omens with us.&rdquo; When those seven
foolish companions heard that, they said, &ldquo;Do not entertain
groundless fear, for we are not afraid of the omen. If you are afraid,
do not go, but we will start this moment; to-morrow morning our
relations will abandon us, when they hear of our proceedings.&rdquo;
When those ignorant creatures said that, Vish&#7751;udatta set out with
them, urged on by his oath, but he first called to mind Hari, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>dispeller of sin. And at the end of the night he
saw another evil omen, and again mentioned it, and he was rebuked by
all those foolish friends of his in the following words; &ldquo;This is
our evil omen, you coward afraid to travel, that you have been brought
by us, since you shudder at a crow at every step you take; we require
no other evil omen.&rdquo; Having reviled him in these words, they
continued their journey and Vish&#7751;udatta went with them, as he
could not help it, but kept silence, reflecting&mdash;&ldquo;One ought
not to give advice to a fool bent on going his own crooked way, for it
only entails ridicule, being like the beautifying of ordure. A single
wise man fallen among many fools, like a lotus in the path of the
waves, is surely overwhelmed. So I must not henceforth give these men
either good or bad advice, but I must go on in silence; destiny will
educe prosperity.&rdquo; Engaged in these reflections,
Vish&#7751;udatta proceeded on the way with those fools, and at the end
of the day he reached a &#346;avara village. There he wandered about in
the night and reached a certain house inhabited by a young woman, and
asked the woman for a lodging there. She gave him a room, and he
entered it with his friends, and those seven in a moment went to sleep.
He alone remained awake, as he had entered a house belonging to a
savage. For the stupid sleep resolutely, how can the understanding
sleep?</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile a certain young man secretly entered the inner
apartment of the house, and went into the presence of that woman. And
she remained in confidential conversation with him, and as fate would
have it, they both fell asleep. And Vish&#7751;udatta, perceiving it
all through the half-open door by the light of a candle, reflected
despondently, &ldquo;Alas! have we entered the house of a profligate
woman? Surely this is her paramour, and not the husband of her youth,
for otherwise we should not have this timid secret proceeding; I saw at
the first that she was of a flighty disposition; but we have entered
here as mutual witnesses, for lack of others.&rdquo; While he was
thinking he heard outside a noise of men, and he saw entering a young
chief of the &#346;avaras with a sword, looking about him, while his
attendants remained in the sleeping apartment. When the chief
said&mdash;&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Vish&#7751;udatta, supposing him
to be the master of the house, said in his terror&mdash;&ldquo;We are
travellers.&rdquo; But the &#346;avara entered, and seeing his wife in
such a position, he cut off with his sword the head of her sleeping
paramour. But he did not punish or even wake his wife; but placing his
sword on the ground he went to sleep on another couch. Seeing that by
the light of the candle, Vish&#7751;udatta reflected&mdash;&ldquo;He
did right not to kill his wife, but to kill the adulterer; but that he
should sleep here in confidence, after performing such a deed, is an
act of surprising courage, characteristic of men of mighty
minds.&rdquo; While Vish&#7751;udatta was thus reflecting, that wicked
woman awoke and beheld her paramour <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>slain, and that
husband of hers asleep. So she rose up, and took on her shoulder the
body of her lover, and carrying his head in one hand, she went out. And
going outside quickly, she threw into an ash-heap the trunk with the
head, and came secretly back. And Vish&#7751;udatta going out beheld it
all from a distance, and again entering remained as he was, in the
midst of his sleeping companions. But the wicked woman came back, and
entering the room, cut off with that very sword the head of her
sleeping husband. And going out she raised a cry so as to make all the
servants hear, &ldquo;Alas! I am ruined, my husband has been slain by
these travellers.&rdquo; Then the servants, hearing the cry, rushed
forward and beholding their master slain, ran upon Vish&#7751;udatta
and his friends with uplifted weapons. And when those others, his
companions, rose up in terror, as they were about to be slain,
Vish&#7751;udatta said quickly&mdash;&ldquo;Cease your attempt to slay
Br&aacute;hmans! We did not do this deed; this wicked woman herself did
it, being in love with another man. But I saw the whole affair from the
very beginning, through a half-open door; and I went out and observed
what she did, and if you will have patience with me, I will tell
you.&rdquo; Vish&#7751;udatta with these words restrained the
&#346;avaras, and told them the whole affair from the beginning, and
took them out and showed them the trunk with the head freshly severed
and thrown by the woman on that heap of refuse. Then the woman
confessed the truth by the paleness of her face, and all there reviled
the wanton, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Whom will not a wicked woman kill,
when won over by another man, like a sword in an enemy&rsquo;s hand,
since enticed by love she commits reckless crime without being
taught.&rdquo; Having said this, they thereupon let Vish&#7751;udatta
and his companions go; and then the seven companions praised
Vish&#7751;udatta, saying, &ldquo;You became to us, while we were
asleep at night, a protecting jewel-lamp, through your kindness we
escaped to-day from death produced by an evil omen.&rdquo; In these
words they praised Vish&#7751;udatta, and ceased henceforth their
reviling, and after bowing before him they set out in the morning on
their errand, accompanied by him.</p>
<p>Having told this story to Kalingasen&aacute; in their mutual
conversation, Somaprabh&aacute; again said to that friend of hers in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;.&mdash;&ldquo;Thus, my friend, an evil omen
presenting itself to people engaged in any undertaking, if not
counteracted by delay and other methods, produces misfortune. And so
people of dull intelligence, neglecting the advice of the wise, and
acting impetuously, are afflicted in the end. Accordingly you did not
act wisely in sending a messenger to the king of Vatsa, asking him to
receive you, when there was an inauspicious omen. May Fate grant you to
be married without any impediment, but you came from your house in an
unlucky moment, therefore your marriage is far off. And the gods too
are in love with you, so you must be on your guard against this. And
you must think <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>of the minister Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a,
who is expert in politic wiles; he, fearing that the king may become
engrossed in pleasure, may throw impediments in your way in this
business; or he may even bring a charge against you after your marriage
is celebrated: but no, being virtuous, he will not bring a false
accusation; nevertheless, my friend, you must at all events be on your
guard against your rival wife, I will tell you a story illustrative of
this, listen.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this land a city named Ikshumat&iacute;,
and by the side of it there runs a river called by the same name; both
were created by Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra. And near it there is a great
forest, and in it a hermit of the name of Manka&#7751;aka had made
himself a hermitage and performed penance with his heels upwards. And
while he was performing austerities, he saw an Apsaras of the name of
Menak&aacute; coming through the air, with her clothes floating on the
breeze. Then his mind was bewildered by Cupid, who had found his
opportunity, and there was born to him a daughter named
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7328src" href=
"#xd27e7328" name="xd27e7328src">2</a> beautiful in every limb. And
since she was born in the interior of a plantain, her father, the
hermit Manka&#7751;aka, gave her the name of
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;. She grew up in his hermitage like
K&#7771;ip&iacute; the wife of Dro&#7751;a, who was born to Gautama on
his beholding Rambh&aacute;. And once on a time
D&#7771;i&#7693;havarman, a king born in Madhyade&#347;a,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7333src" href="#xd27e7333" name="xd27e7333src">3</a>
who in the excitement of the chase was carried away by his horse,
entered that hermitage. He beheld Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute; clothed in
garments of bark, having her beauty exceedingly set off by the dress
appropriate to the daughter of an ascetic. And she, when seen,
captivated the heart of that king so completely, that she left no room
in it for the women of his harem. While thinking to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I be able to obtain as a wife this daughter
of some hermit or other, as Dushyanta obtained &#346;akuntal&aacute;
the daughter of the hermit Kanva?&rdquo;&mdash;the king beheld that
hermit Manka&#7751;aka coming with fuel and <i>ku&#347;a</i>-grass. And
leaving his horse, he approached him and worshipped at his feet, and
when questioned, discovered himself to that hermit. Then the hermit
gave the following order to Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear child, prepare the <i>arghya</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7341src" href="#xd27e7341" name="xd27e7341src">4</a> for this
king our guest.&rdquo; She said&mdash;&ldquo;I will do
so&rdquo;&mdash;and bowing, prepared the hospitable offering, and then
the king said to the hermit&mdash;&ldquo;Whence did you obtain this
maiden who is so beautiful?&rdquo;&mdash;Then the hermit told the king
the story of her birth, and her name <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, which indicated the
manner of it. Then the king, considering the maiden born from the
hermit&rsquo;s thinking on Menak&aacute; to be an Apsaras, earnestly
craved her hand of her father. And the sage gave him that daughter
named Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, for the actions of the sages of old
time, guided by divine insight, were without hesitation. And the nymphs
of heaven, discovering the fact by their divine power, came there out
of love for Menak&aacute;, and adorned her for the wedding. And on that
very occasion they put mustard-seeds into her hand and said to
her,&mdash;&ldquo;As you are going along the path, sow them, in order
that you may know it again. If, daughter, at any time your husband
should scorn you, and you should wish to return here, then you will be
able, as you come along, to recognise the path by these, which will
have sprung up.&rdquo; When they had said this to her, and her marriage
had been celebrated, the king D&#7771;i&#7693;havarman placed
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute; on his horse, and departed thence. His army
came up and escorted him, and in company with that bride of his, who
sowed the mustard-seeds all along the path, he reached his own palace.
There he became averse to the society of his other wives, and dwelt
with that Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, after telling her story to his
ministers.</p>
<p>Then his principal wife, being exceedingly afflicted, said to his
minister in secret, after reminding him of the benefits she had
conferred upon him: &ldquo;The king is now exclusively attached to his
new wife and has deserted me, so take steps to make this rival of mine
depart.&rdquo; When that minister heard that, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;Queen, it is not appropriate for people like me to
destroy or banish their masters&rsquo; wives. This is the business of
the wives of wandering religious mendicants, addicted to jugglery and
such practices, associating with men like themselves. For those
hypocritical female ascetics, creeping unforbidden into houses, skilled
in deception, will stick at no deed whatever.&rdquo; When he said this
to her, the queen, as if abashed, said to him in affected
shame&mdash;&ldquo;Then I will have nothing to do with this proceeding
disapproved of by the virtuous.&rdquo; But she laid up his speech in
her heart, and dismissing that minister, she summoned by the mouth of
her maid a certain wandering female ascetic. And she told her all that
desire of hers from the beginning, and promised to give her great
wealth if the business were successfully accomplished. And the wicked
female ascetic, from desire of gain, said to the afflicted
queen&mdash;&ldquo;Queen, this is an easy matter, I will accomplish it
for you, for I know very many expedients of various kinds.&rdquo;
Having thus consoled the queen, that female ascetic departed; and after
reaching her house, she reflected as one afraid, &ldquo;Alas! whom will
not excessive desire of gain delude, since I rashly made such a promise
before the queen? But the fact is, I know no device of the kind, and it
is not possible to carry on any deception in the palace, as I do in
other places, for the authorities might perhaps find it out and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>punish me. There may be one resource in this
difficulty, for I have a friend, a barber, and as he is skilled in
devices of the kind, all may yet go well, if he exert himself in the
matter.&rdquo; After thus reflecting, she went to the barber, and told
him all her plan that was to bring her prosperity. Then the barber, who
was old and cunning, reflected&mdash;&ldquo;This is good luck, that an
opportunity of making something has now presented itself to me. So we
must not kill the king&rsquo;s new wife, but we must preserve her
alive, for her father has divine insight, and would reveal the whole
transaction. But by separating her from the king we will now batten
upon the queen, for great people become servants to a servant who
shares their criminal secrets. And in due time I will re-unite her to
the king, and tell him the whole story, in order that he and the
sage&rsquo;s daughter may become a source of subsistence to me. And
thus I shall not have done anything very wrong, and I shall have a
livelihood for a long time.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the barber
said to the hypocritical female ascetic&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, I will do
all this, but it would not be proper to slay that new wife of the
king&rsquo;s by means of magic, for the king might some day find it
out, and then he would destroy us all: besides we should incur the sin
of woman-murder, and her father the sage would curse us. Therefore it
is far better that she should be separated from the king by means of
our ingenuity, in order that the queen may be happy, and we may obtain
wealth [punctuation missing in scan] And this is an easy matter to me,
for what can I not accomplish by force of intellect? Hear my ingenuity,
I will relate a story which illustrates it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the king and the barber&rsquo;s wife</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This king D&#7771;i&#7693;havarman had an immoral
father. And I was then his servant, being engaged in the duties which
belong to me. He, one day, as he was roaming about here, cast eyes on
my wife; and as she was young and beautiful, his mind became attached
to her. And when he asked his attendants who she was, they
said&mdash;&ldquo;The barber&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; He
thought&mdash;&ldquo;What can the barber do?&rdquo; So the wicked king
entered my house, and after enjoying at will the society of my wife,
departed. But, as it happened, I was away from my house that day, being
absent somewhere or other. And the next day, when I entered, I saw that
my wife&rsquo;s manner had altered, and when I asked her the reason,
she told me the whole story, being full of pride at what had occurred.
And in that way the king went on puffing up my wife by continual
visits, which I was powerless to prevent. A prince distracted by unholy
passion makes no distinction between what is lawful and what is
illicit. The forest is like straw to a sylvan fire fanned by the wind.
So, not being in possession of any other expedient for restraining my
sovereign, I reduced myself with spare diet, and took refuge in feigned
sickness. And in this state I went into the presence of that king to
perform my duties, sighing deeply, pale and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>emaciated. Then the king, seeing that I seemed
to be ill, asked me meaningly the following
question&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd27e7360" title=
"Source: Hola">Holla</span>! tell me why you have become thus?&rdquo;
And after he had questioned me persistently, I answered the king in
private, after imploring immunity from punishment&mdash;&ldquo;King, my
wife is a witch. And when I am asleep she extracts my entrails and
sucks them, and then replaces them as before&mdash;This is how I have
become lean. So how can continual refreshment and eating nourish
me?&rdquo; When I said this to the king, he became anxious and
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Can she really be a witch? Why was I captivated
by her? I wonder whether she will suck my entrails also, since I am
well nourished with food. So I will myself contrive to test her this
very night.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, the king caused food to be
given me on the spot. Then I went home and shed tears in the presence
of my wife, and when she questioned me, I said to her&mdash;&ldquo;My
beloved, you must not reveal to any one what I am about to tell you.
Listen! That king has teeth as sharp as the edge of a thunderbolt,
where teeth are not usually found, and they broke my razor to-day while
I was performing my duties. And in this way I shall break a razor every
time. So how am I to be continually procuring fresh razors? This is why
I weep, for the means of supporting myself in my home are
destroyed.&rdquo; When I had said this to my wife, she made up her mind
to investigate the marvel of the concealed teeth while the king was
asleep, since he was to visit her at night. But she did not perceive
that such a thing had never been seen since the world was, and could
not be true. Even clever women are deceived by the tales of an
impostor.</p>
<p>So the king came at night and visited my wife at will, and as if
fatigued, pretended to go to sleep, remembering what I had said. Then
my wife, thinking he was asleep, slowly stretched out her hand to find
his concealed teeth. And as soon as her hand reached him, the king
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;A witch! A witch!&rdquo; and left the house in
terror. Henceforth my wife, having been abandoned by the king out of
fear, became satisfied with me and devoted to me exclusively. In this
way I saved my wife on a former occasion from the king by my
intelligence.</p>
<p>Having told this story to the female ascetic, the barber went on to
say&mdash;&ldquo;So, my good lady, this desire of yours must be
accomplished by wisdom; and I will tell you, mother, how it is to be
done, listen to me. Some old servant of the harem must be won over to
say to this king in secret every day, &lsquo;Your wife
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute; is a witch.&rsquo; For she, being a forest
maiden, has no attendants of her own, and what will not all alien
servants do for gain, being easily corrupted? Accordingly, when the
king becomes apprehensive on hearing what the old servant says, you
must contrive to place at night hands and feet and other limbs in the
chamber of Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7367src" href="#xd27e7367" name="xd27e7367src">5</a> Then the
king will see them in the morning, and concluding that what the old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>man says is true, will be afraid of
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute; and desert her of his own accord. So the
queen will be delighted at getting rid of a rival wife, and entertain a
favourable opinion of you, and we shall gain some advantage.&rdquo;
When the barber said this to the female ascetic, she consented and went
and told the whole matter to the king&rsquo;s head queen. And the queen
carried out her suggestions, and the king, who had been warned, saw the
hands and feet in the morning with his own eyes, and abandoned
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, thinking her to be wicked. So the female
ascetic, together with the barber, enjoyed to the full the presents
which the queen secretly gave to her, being pleased with her aid.</p>
<p>So Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, being abandoned by
D&#7771;i&#7693;havarman, went out from the palace, grieved because the
king would be cursed. And she returned to the hermitage of her father
by the same path by which she came, which she was able to recognise by
the mustard-seeds she had sown, which had sprung up.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7374src" href="#xd27e7374" name="xd27e7374src">6</a> Her
father, the hermit Manka&#7751;aka, when he saw her suddenly arrived
there, remained for some time suspecting immorality on her part. And
then he perceived the whole occurrence by the power of contemplation,
and after lovingly comforting her, departed thence with her. And he
went and told the king, who bowed before him, the whole treacherous
drama, which the head queen had got up out of hatred for her rival. At
that moment the barber himself arrived, and related the whole
occurrence to the king, and then proceeded to say this to him;
&ldquo;In this way, my sovereign, I sent away the lady
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, and so delivered her from the danger of the
incantations which would have been practised against her, since I
satisfied the head queen by an artifice.&rdquo; When the king heard
that, he saw that the speech of the great hermit was certainly true,
and he took back Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;, recovering his confidence
in her. And after respectfully accompanying the departing hermit, he
rewarded the barber with wealth, thinking that he was attached to his
person: kings are the appointed prey of rogues. Then the king, being
averse to the society of his queen, lived in great comfort with
Kadal&iacute;garbh&aacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many false accusations of this kind do rival wives bring, O
Kalingasen&aacute; of irreproachable beauty. And you are a maiden, the
auspicious moment of whose marriage is fixed at a distant date, and
even the gods, whose goings transcend our thought, are in love with
you. So do you yourself preserve yourself now, as the one jewel of the
world, dedicated to the king of Vatsa only, from all assaults, for your
own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>excellence brings you enmity. I indeed, my
friend, shall never return to you, since you are now established in the
palace of your husband: good women do not visit the house of a
friend&rsquo;s husband, O fair one! besides I have been forbidden by my
own lord. And it is not possible for me to come here secretly, induced
by my affection for you, inasmuch as my husband possesses divine
insight and would find it out; with difficulty in truth did I obtain
his permission to come here to-day. And since I can be of no use to you
now, my friend, I will return home, but if my husband should give me
permission, I will come here again, disregarding modesty.&rdquo; Thus
Somaprabh&aacute;, the daughter of the Asura king, spake weeping to
Kalingasen&aacute;, the daughter of the mortal king, whose face also
was washed with tears, and after embracing her, departed swiftly to her
own palace, as the day was passing away.</p>

capital of the king of Vatsa, which Kalingasen&aacute; reached in one
day in the magic chariot, has not been ascertained. He says: &ldquo;It
has been discovered by General Cunningham. The place is still called
Kosam, and is on the Yamun&aacute;, about 30 miles above Allahabad. The
ruins consist of an immense fortress, with earthen ramparts from 30 to
35 feet high, and bastions considerably higher, forming a circuit of
23,100 feet, or exactly four miles and 3 furlongs. The parapets were of
brick and stone, some of the bricks measuring 19 in. &times; 12&frac12;
&times; 2&frac12;, which is a proof of their great antiquity. In the
midst of these ruins is a large stone monolith, similar to those at
Allahabad and Delhi, but without any inscription. The portion of the
shaft above ground is 14 feet in length, and an excavation made at the
base for a depth of 20 feet did not come to the end of it. Its total
length probably exceeds 40 feet. There was, I believe, some talk of
removing it to Allahabad and setting it up there, but it was found to
be too expensive an undertaking.&rdquo; &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then the princess Kalingasen&aacute;, who had deserted
her own country and relations, remembering her dear friend
Somaprabh&aacute; who had left her, and finding the great festival of
her marriage with the king of Vatsa delayed, remained in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; like a doe that had strayed from the
forest.</p>
<p>And the king of Vatsa, feeling a little bitter against the
astrologers, who were so dexterous in deferring the marriage of
Kalingasen&aacute;, being despondent with love-longing, went that day
to divert his mind, to the private apartments of
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. There the queen, who had been tutored
beforehand by the excellent minister, let fall no sign of anger, but
shewed especial sedulity in honouring her husband with her usual
attentions. And the king, wondering how it was that, even though she
knew the episode of Kalingasen&aacute;, the queen was not angry, being
desirous of knowing the cause, said to her; &ldquo;Do you know, queen,
that a princess named Kalingasen&aacute; has come here to choose me for
her husband?&rdquo; The moment she heard it, she answered, without
changing the hue of her countenance, &ldquo;I know it; I am exceedingly
delighted, for in her the goddess of Fortune has come to our house; for
by gaining her you will also get her father Kalingadatta under your
influence, and the earth will be more completely in your power. Now I
am delighted on account of his great power and your pleasure, and long
ago did I know this circumstance with regard to you. So am I not
fortunate, since I have such a husband as you, whom princesses fall in
love with, that are themselves sought <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>by other
kings?&rdquo; When thus addressed by queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;,
who had been previously tutored by <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
the king rejoiced in his heart. And after enjoying a drinking-bout with
her, he slept that night in her apartments, and waking up in the
morning he reflected&mdash;&ldquo;What, does the magnanimous queen obey
me so implicitly as even to acquiesce in having Kalingasen&aacute; for
a rival? But how could this same proud woman endure her, since it was
owing to the special favour of destiny that she did not yield her
breath, even when I married Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;? So, if anything
were to happen to her, it would be utter ruin; upon her hang the lives
of my son, my brother-in-law, my father-in-law, and
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and the welfare of the kingdom; what higher
tribute can I pay her? So how can I marry that
Kalingasen&aacute;?&rdquo; Thus reflecting the king of Vatsa left her
chamber at the close of night, and the next day went to the palace of
queen Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;. She too, having been taught her lesson
by V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, shewed him attentions after the very same
fashion, and when questioned by him, gave a similar answer. The next
day the king, thinking over the sentiments and speeches of the queens,
which were completely in unison, commended them to
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a. And the minister
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who knew how to seize the right moment,
seeing that the king was plunged in doubt, spake slowly to him as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;I know well, the matter does not end where you
think, there is a terrible resolve here. For the queens spoke thus,
because they are steadfastly bent on surrendering their lives. Chaste
women, when their beloved is attached to another, or has gone to
heaven, become careless about all enjoyments, and determined to die,
though their intentions are inscrutable on account of the haughtiness
of their character. For matrons cannot endure the interruption of a
deep affection; and in proof of this hear now, O king, this story of
&#346;rutasena.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of &#346;rutasena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived long ago in the Dekhan, in a city called
Gokar&#7751;a, a king named &#346;rutasena, who was the ornament of his
race, and possessed of learning. And this king, though his prosperity
was complete, had yet one source of sorrow, that he had not as yet
obtained a wife who was a suitable match for him. And once on a time
the king, while brooding over that sorrow, began to talk about it, and
was thus addressed by a Br&aacute;hman, named Agni&#347;arman: &ldquo;I
have seen two wonders, O king, I will describe them to you: listen!
Having gone on a pilgrimage to all the sacred bathing-places, I reached
that Panchat&iacute;rth&iacute;, in which five Apsarases were reduced
to the condition of crocodiles by the curse of a holy sage, and were
rescued from it by Arjuna, who had come there while going round the
holy spots. There I bathed in the blessed water, which possesses the
power of enabling those men, who bathe in it and fast for five nights,
to become followers of N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a. And while I was
departing, I beheld a cultivator in the middle of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>field, who had furrowed the earth with his
plough, singing. That cultivator was asked about the road by a certain
wandering hermit, who had come that way, but did not hear what he said,
being wholly occupied with his song. Then the hermit was angry with
that cultivator, and began to talk in a distracted manner; and the
cultivator, stopping his song, said to him&mdash;&lsquo;Alas! though
you are a hermit, you will not learn even a fraction of virtue; even I,
though a fool, have discovered what is the highest essence of
virtue.&rsquo; When he heard that, the hermit asked him out of
curiosity&mdash;&lsquo;What have you discovered?&rsquo; And the
cultivator answered him&mdash;&lsquo;Sit here in the shade, and listen
while I tell you a tale.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the three Br&aacute;hman brothers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this land there were three Br&aacute;hman brothers,
Brahmadatta, Somadatta, and Vi&#347;vadatta of holy deeds. Of these the
two eldest possessed wives, but the youngest was unmarried; he remained
as their servant without being angry, obeying their orders along with
me; for I was their ploughman. And those elder brothers thought that he
was soft, and devoid of intellect, good, not swerving from the right
path, simple, and unenterprising. Then, once on a time, the youngest
brother Vi&#347;vadatta was solicited by his two brothers&rsquo; wives
who fell in love with him, but he rejected their advances as if each of
them had been his mother. Then they both of them went and said falsely
to their own husbands, &ldquo;This younger brother of yours makes love
to us in secret.&rdquo; This speech made those two elder brothers
cherish anger against him in their hearts, for men bewildered by the
speeches of wicked women, do not know the difference between truth and
falsehood. Then those brothers said once on a time to
Vi&#347;vadatta&mdash;&ldquo;Go and level that ant-hill in the middle
of the field!&rdquo; He said&mdash;&ldquo;I will&rdquo;&mdash;and went
and proceeded to dig up the ant-hill with his spade, though I said to
him, &ldquo;Do not do it, a venomous snake lives there.&rdquo; Though
he heard what I said, he continued to dig at the ant-hill,
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Let what will happen, happen,&rdquo; for he
would not disobey the order of his two elder brothers, though they
wished him ill. Then, while he was digging it up, he got out of it a
pitcher filled with gold, and not a venomous snake, for virtue is an
auxiliary to the good. So he took that pitcher and gave it all to his
elder brothers out of his constant affection for them, though I tried
to dissuade him. But they sent assassins, hiring them with a portion of
that gold, and had his hands and feet cut off, in their desire to seize
his wealth. But he was free from anger, and in spite of that treatment,
did not wax wroth with his brothers, and on account of that virtue of
his, his hands and feet grew again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After beholding that, I renounced from that time all anger,
but you, though you are a hermit, have not even now renounced anger.
The man who is free from anger has gained heaven, behold now a proof of
this.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>After saying this, the husbandman left his body
and ascended to heaven. &ldquo;This is one wonder which I have seen,
hear a second, O king;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying this to king &#346;rutasena, the Br&aacute;hman
continued, &ldquo;Then, as I was roaming about on the shore of the sea
to visit sacred places, I reached the realm of king Vasantasena. There,
as I was about to enter an almshouse where cooked food is distributed
by the king, the Br&aacute;hmans said to
me,&mdash;&lsquo;Br&aacute;hman, advance not in that direction, for
there the king&rsquo;s daughter is present, she is called
Vidyuddyot&aacute;, and if even a hermit beholds her, he is pierced by
the arrow of love, and becoming distracted ceases to live.&rsquo; Then
I answered them&mdash;&lsquo;This is not wonderful to me, for I
continually behold king &#346;rutasena, who is a second god of love.
When he leaves his palace on an expedition, or for some other purpose,
women of good family are removed by guards from any place whence they
may possibly see him, for fear they should infringe chastity.&rsquo;
When I said this, they knew I was a subject of your Majesty&rsquo;s,
and the superintendent of the house of entertainment and the
king&rsquo;s chaplain took me into the presence of the king, that I
might share the feast. There I saw that princess Vidyuddyot&aacute;,
looking like the incarnation of the magic art with which the god of
love bewilders the world. After a long time I mastered my confusion at
beholding her, and reflected&mdash;&lsquo;If this lady were to become
the wife of our sovereign, he would forget his kingdom. Nevertheless I
must tell this tale to my master, otherwise there might take place the
incident of Devasena and Unm&aacute;din&iacute;.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of Devasena and Unm&aacute;din&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time, in the realm of king Devasena, there
was a merchant&rsquo;s daughter, a maiden that bewildered the world
with her beauty. Her father told the king about her, but the king did
not take her in marriage, for the Br&aacute;hmans, who wished to
prevent his neglecting his duties, told him she had inauspicious marks.
So she was married to his prime minister.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7441src" href="#xd27e7441" name="xd27e7441src">1</a> And once on
a time she showed herself to the king at a window. And the king, struck
by her with a poisonous look from a distance, as if she had been a
female snake,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7444src" href="#xd27e7444"
name="xd27e7444src">2</a> fainted again and again, enjoyed no pleasure,
and took no food. And the righteous king, though entreated over and
over again to marry her by the ministers, with her husband at their
head, refused to do so, and devoted to her, yielded up his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly I have come to-day and told you this wonderful
tale, thinking that if a similar distraction were to come upon you, I
should be guilty of conspiring against your life.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>When king &#346;rutasena heard from that Br&aacute;hman this speech,
which was like the command of the god of love, he became ardently
attached to Vidyuddyot&aacute;, so he immediately sent off the
Br&aacute;hman and took steps to have her brought quickly and married
her. Then the princess Vidyuddyot&aacute; became inseparable from the
person of that king, as the daylight from the orb of the sun.</p>
<p>Then a maiden of the name of M&aacute;t&#7771;idatt&aacute;, the
daughter of a very rich merchant, intoxicated with the pride of her
beauty, came to select that king for her husband. Through fear of
committing unrighteousness, the king married that merchant&rsquo;s
daughter; then Vidyuddyot&aacute;, coming to hear of it, died of a
broken heart. And the king came and beheld that dearly loved wife lying
dead, and took her up in his arms, and lamenting, died on the spot.
Thereupon M&aacute;t&#7771;idatt&aacute;, the merchant&rsquo;s
daughter, entered the fire. And so the whole kingdom perished with the
king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, king, that the breaking off of long love is
difficult to bear, especially would it be so to the proud queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. Accordingly, if you were to marry this
Kalingasen&aacute;, the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; would
indubitably quit her life, and queen Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; would do
the same, for their life is one. And then how would your son
Narav&aacute;hanadatta live? And, I know, the king&rsquo;s heart would
not be able to bear any misfortune happening to him. And so all this
happiness would perish in a moment, O king. But as for the dignified
reserve, which the queens displayed in their speeches, that
sufficiently shews that their hearts are indifferent to all things,
being firmly resolved on suicide. So you must guard your own interests,
for even animals understand self-protection, much more wise men like
yourself, O king.&rdquo; The king of Vatsa, when he heard this at
length from the excellent minister <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
having now become quite capable of wise discrimination,
said&mdash;&ldquo;It is so; there can be no doubt about it; all this
fabric of my happiness would be overthrown. So what is the use of my
marrying Kalingasen&aacute;? Accordingly the astrologers did well in
mentioning a distant hour as auspicious for the marriage: and there
cannot after all be much sin in abandoning one who had come to select
me as her husband.&rdquo; When <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
heard this, he reflected with joy, &ldquo;Our business has almost
turned out according to our wishes. Will not that same great plant of
policy, watered with the streams of expedient, and nourished with due
time and place, truly bring forth fruit?&rdquo; Thus reflecting, and
meditating upon fitting time and place, the minister <span class="corr"
title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
went to his house, after taking a ceremonious farewell of the king.</p>
<p>The king too went to the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, who had
assumed to welcome him a manner which concealed her real feelings, and
thus spoke to her to console her: &ldquo;Why do I speak? you know well,
O gazelle-eyed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>one, that your love is my life, even as the
water is of the lotus. Could I bear even to mention the name of another
woman? But Kalingasen&aacute; came to my house of her own impetuous
motion. And this is well known, that Rambh&aacute;, who came to visit
Arjuna of her own impetuous will, having been rejected by him, as he
was engaged in austerities, inflicted on him a curse which made him a
eunuch. That curse was endured by him to the end, living in the house
of the king of Vir&aacute;&#7789;a in the garb of a eunuch, though he
displayed miraculous valour. So I did not reject this
Kalingasen&aacute; when she came, but I cannot bring myself to do
anything without your wish.&rdquo; Having comforted her in these words,
and having perceived by the flush of wine which rose to her cheek, as
if it were her glowing passionate heart, that her cruel design was a
reality, the king of Vatsa spent that night with the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, delighted at the transcendent ability of his
prime minister.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile that Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa, named
Yoge&#347;vara, who was a friend of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
and whom he had commissioned beforehand to watch day and night the
proceedings of Kalingasen&aacute;, came that very night of his own
accord and said to the prime minister: &ldquo;I remain ever at
Kalingasen&aacute;&rsquo;s house, either without it or within it, and I
have never seen man or god come there. But to-day I suddenly heard an
indistinct noise in the air, at the commencement of the night, as I was
lying hid near the roof of the palace. Then my magic science was set in
motion to ascertain the cause of the sound, but prevailed not; so I
pondered over it, and came to this conclusion: &lsquo;This must
certainly be the voice of some being of divine power, enamoured of
Kalingasen&aacute;, who is roaming in the sky. Since my science does
not succeed, I must look for some opening, for clever people who remain
vigilant, find little difficulty in discovering holes in their
opponents&rsquo; armour. And I know that the prime minister
said&mdash;&ldquo;Divine beings are in love with
her&rdquo;&mdash;moreover I overheard her friend Somaprabh&aacute;
saying the same. After arriving at this conclusion I came here to make
my report to you. This I have to ask you by the way, so tell me so much
I pray you. By my magic power I heard, without being seen, what you
said to the king, &lsquo;Even animals understand
self-protection.&rsquo; Now tell me, sagacious man, if there is any
instance of this.&rdquo;&mdash;When Yoge&#347;vara asked him this
question, <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
answered. &ldquo;There is, my friend, and to prove it, I will tell you
this tale. Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The tale of the ichneumon, the owl, the cat, and the
mouse.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once on a time there was a large banyan tree outside
the city of Vidi&#347;&aacute;. In that vast tree dwelt four creatures,
an ichneumon, an owl, a cat, and a mouse,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7482src" href="#xd27e7482" name="xd27e7482src">3</a> and their
habitations were apart. The ichneumon and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>the mouse dwelt in
separate holes in the root, the cat in a great hollow in the middle of
the tree: but the owl dwelt in a bower of creepers on the top of it,
which was inaccessible to the others. Among these the mouse was the
natural prey of all three, three out of the four of the cat. The mouse,
the ichneumon, and the owl ranged for food during the night, the two
first through fear of the cat only, the owl partly because it was his
nature to do so. But the cat fearlessly wandered night and day through
the neighbouring barley-field, in order to catch the mouse, while the
others went there by stealth at a suitable time out of desire for food.
One day a certain hunter of the Cha&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;la caste came
there. He saw the track of the cat entering that field, and having set
nooses all round the field in order to compass its death, departed. So
the cat came there at night to slay the mouse, and entering the field
was caught in one of the hunter&rsquo;s nooses. The mouse, for his
part, came there secretly in search of food, and seeing the cat caught
in the noose, danced for joy. While it was entering the field, the owl
and ichneumon came from afar by the same path, and seeing the cat fast
in the noose, desired to capture the mouse. And the mouse, beholding
them afar off, was terrified and reflected&mdash;&ldquo;If I fly to the
cat, which the owl and the ichneumon are afraid of, that enemy, though
fast in the noose, may slay me with one blow, but if I keep at a
distance from the cat, the owl and the ichneumon will be the death of
me. So being compassed about with enemies, where shall I go, what shall
I do? Ah! I will take refuge with the cat here, for it is in trouble,
and may save me to preserve its own life, as I shall be of use to gnaw
through the noose.&rdquo; Thus reflecting the mouse slowly approached
the cat, and said to it, &ldquo;I am exceedingly grieved at your being
caught, so I will gnaw through your noose; the upright come to love
even their enemies by dwelling in their neighbourhood. But I do not
feel confidence in you, as I do not know your intentions.&rdquo; When
the cat heard that, he said &ldquo;Worthy mouse, be at rest, from this
day forth you are my friend as giving me life.&rdquo; The moment he
heard this from the cat, he crept into his bosom; when the owl and
ichneumon saw that, they went away hopeless. Then the cat, galled with
the noose, said to the mouse, &ldquo;My friend, the night is almost
gone, so quickly gnaw through my bonds<span class="corr" id="xd27e7489"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; The mouse for its part, waiting
for the arrival of the hunter, slowly nibbled the noose, and protracted
the business, making a continual munching with its teeth, which was all
pretence. Soon the night came to an end, and the hunter came near; then
the mouse, at the request of the cat, quickly gnawed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>through the noose which held it. So the
cat&rsquo;s noose was severed, and it ran away, afraid of the hunter;
and the mouse, delivered from death, fled into its hole. But when
called again by the cat, it reposed no confidence in him, but remarked,
&ldquo;The truth is, an enemy is occasionally made a friend by
circumstances, but does not remain such for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the mouse, though an animal, saved its life from many
foes, much more ought the same thing to take place among men. You heard
that speech which I uttered to the king on that occasion, to the effect
that by wisdom he should guard his own interests by preserving the life
of the queen. And wisdom is in every exigency the best friend, not
valour, Yoge&#347;vara; in illustration of this hear the following
story.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The story of king Prasenajit and the Br&aacute;hman
who lost his treasure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city named &#346;r&aacute;vast&iacute;, and
in it there lived in old time a king of the name of Prasenajit, and one
day a strange Br&aacute;hman arrived in that city. A merchant, thinking
he was virtuous, because he lived on rice in the husk, provided him a
lodging there in the house of a Br&aacute;hman. There he was loaded by
him every day with presents of unhusked rice and other gifts, and
gradually by other great merchants also, who came to hear his story. In
this way the miserly fellow gradually accumulated a thousand
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, and, going to the forest, he dug a hole
and buried it in the ground,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7504src" href=
"#xd27e7504" name="xd27e7504src">4</a> and he went every day and
examined the spot. Now one day he saw that the hole, in which he had
hidden his gold, had been re-opened, and that all the gold had gone.
When he saw that hole empty, his soul was smitten, and not only was
there a void in his heart, but the whole universe seemed to him to be
void also. And then he came crying to the Br&aacute;hman, in whose
house he lived, and when questioned, he told him his whole story: and
he made up his mind to go to a holy bathing-place, and starve himself
to death. Then the merchant, who supplied him with food, hearing of it,
came there with others, and said to him, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, why do
you long to die for the loss of your wealth? Wealth, like an
unseasonable cloud, suddenly comes and goes.&rdquo; Though plied by him
with these and similar arguments, he would not abandon his fixed
determination to commit suicide, for wealth is dearer to the miser than
life itself. But when the Br&aacute;hman was going to the holy place to
commit suicide, the king Prasenajit himself, having heard of it, came
to him and asked him, &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, do you know of any mark by
which you can recognize the place where you buried your
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>?&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that,
he said: &ldquo;There is a small tree in the wood there, I buried that
wealth at its foot.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he said, &ldquo;I
will find that wealth and give it back to you, or I will give it you
from my own treasury, do not commit suicide, Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo;
After saying this, and so diverting the Br&aacute;hman from his
intention of committing suicide, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299"
href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>the king entrusted him to the
care of the merchant, and retired to his palace. There he pretended to
have a headache, and sending out the door-keeper, he summoned all the
physicians in the city by proclamation with beat of drum. And he took
aside every single one of them and questioned him privately in the
following words: &ldquo;What patients have you here, and how many, and
what medicine have you prescribed for each?&rdquo; And they thereupon,
one by one, answered all the king&rsquo;s questions. Then one among the
physicians, when his turn came to be questioned, said this, &ldquo;The
merchant M&aacute;t&#7771;idatta has been out of sorts, O king, and
this is the second day, that I have prescribed for him
<i>n&aacute;gabal&aacute;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7522src"
href="#xd27e7522" name="xd27e7522src">5</a> When the king heard that,
he sent for the merchant, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me, who
fetched you the <i>n&aacute;gabal&aacute;</i>?&rdquo; The merchant
said&mdash;&ldquo;My servant, your highness.&rdquo; When the king got
this answer from the merchant, he quickly summoned the servant and said
to him&mdash;&ldquo;Give up that treasure belonging to a
Br&aacute;hman, consisting of a store of <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>,
which you found when you were digging at the foot of a tree for
<i>n&aacute;gabal&aacute;</i>.&rdquo; When the king said this to him,
the servant was frightened and confessed immediately, and bringing
those <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> left them there. So the king for his
part summoned the Br&aacute;hman and gave him, who had been fasting in
the meanwhile, his <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, lost and found again,
like a second soul external to his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus that king by his wisdom recovered for the Br&aacute;hman
his wealth, which had been taken away from the root of the tree,
knowing that that simple grew in such spots. So true is it, that
intellect always obtains the supremacy, triumphing over valour, indeed
in such cases what could courage accomplish? Accordingly,
Yoge&#347;vara, you ought to bring it to pass by your wisdom, that some
peccadillo be discovered in Kalingasen&aacute;. And it is true that the
gods and Asuras are in love with her. This explains your hearing at
night the sound of some being in the air. And if we could only obtain
some pretext, calamity would fall upon her, not on us; the king would
not marry her, and yet we should not have dealt unrighteously with
her.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa Yoge&#347;vara
heard all this from the sagacious Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, he was
delighted and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Who except the god
V&#7771;ihaspati can match thee in policy? This counsel of thine waters
with ambrosia the tree of empire. I, even I, will investigate with
wisdom and might the proceedings of Kalingasen&aacute;.&rdquo; Having
said this, Yoge&#347;vara departed thence.</p>
<p>And at this time Kalingasen&aacute;, while in her palace, was
continually afflicted by beholding the king of Vatsa roaming about in
his palace and its grounds. Thinking on him, she was inflamed with
love, and though she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300"
name="pb300">300</a>]</span>wore a bracelet and necklace of lotus
fibres, she never obtained relief thereby, nor from sandal-ointment, or
other remedies.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
Madanavega, who had seen her before, remained wounded by the arrow of
ardent love. Though he had performed a vow to obtain her, and had been
granted a boon by &#346;iva, still she was not easy to gain, because
she was living in the land of another, and attached to another, so the
Vidy&aacute;dhara prince was wandering about at night in the air over
her palace, in order to obtain an opportunity. But, remembering the
order of &#346;iva pleased with his asceticism, he assumed one night by
his skill the form of the king of Vatsa. And in his shape he entered
her palace, saluted with praises by the door-keepers, who
said&mdash;&ldquo;Unable to bear delay, the king has come here without
the knowledge of his ministers.&rdquo; And Kalingasen&aacute;, on
beholding him, rose up bewildered with agitation, though she was, so to
speak, warned by her ornaments which jingled out the
sounds&mdash;&ldquo;This is not the man.&rdquo; Then she by degrees
gained confidence in him, and Madanavega, wearing the form of the king
of Vatsa, made her his wife by the G&aacute;ndharva rite. At that
moment Yoge&#347;vara entered, invisible by his magic, and, beholding
the incident, was cast down, supposing that he saw the king of Vatsa
before him. He went and told <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
who, on receiving his report, saw by his skill that the king was in the
society of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;. So by the order of the prime
minister he returned delighted, to observe the shape of that secret
paramour of Kalingasen&aacute;, when asleep. And so he went and beheld
that Madanavega asleep in his own form on the bed of the sleeping
Kalingasen&aacute;, a heavenly being, the dustless lotus of whose foot
was marked with the umbrella and the banner; and who had lost his power
of changing his form, because his science was suspended during sleep.
Then Yoge&#347;vara, full of delight, went and told what he had seen in
a joyful mood to <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>.
He said&mdash;&ldquo;One like me knows nothing, you know everything by
the eye of policy; by your counsel this difficult result has been
attained for your king. What is the sky without the sun? What is a tank
without water? What is a realm without counsel? What is speech without
truth?&rdquo; When Yoge&#347;vara said this, <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
took leave of him, much pleased, and went in the morning to visit the
king of Vatsa. He approached him with the usual reverence, and in
course of conversation said to the king, who asked him what was to be
done about Kalingasen&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;She is unchaste, O king, and
does not deserve to touch your hand. For she went of her own accord to
visit Prasenajit. When she saw that he was old, she was disgusted, and
came to visit you out of desire for your beauty, and now she even
enjoys at her pleasure the society of another person.&rdquo; When the
king heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;How could a lady of birth and
rank do such a deed? Or who has power to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>enter my
harem?&rdquo; When the king said this, the wise <span class="corr"
title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
answered him, &ldquo;I will prove it to you by ocular testimony this
very night, my sovereign. For the divine Siddhas and other beings of
the kind are in love with her. What can a man do against them? And who
here can interfere with the movements of gods? So come and see it with
your own eyes.&rdquo; When the minister said this, the king determined
to go there with him at night.</p>
<p>Then Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a came to the queen, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;To-day, O queen, I have carried out what I promised,
that the king should marry no other wife except queen
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and thereupon he told her the whole story of
Kalingasen&aacute;. And the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
congratulated him, bowing low and saying&mdash;&ldquo;This is the fruit
which I have reaped from following your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, at night, when folk were asleep, the king of Vatsa went with
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a to the palace of Kalingasen&aacute;. And
entering unperceived, he beheld Madanavega in his proper form, sleeping
by the side of the sleeping Kalingasen&aacute;. And when the king was
minded to slay that audacious one, the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince was
roused by his own magic knowledge, and when awake, he went out, and
immediately flew up into the heaven. And then Kalingasen&aacute; awoke
immediately. And seeing the bed empty, she said, &ldquo;How is this,
that the king of Vatsa wakes up before me, and departs, leaving me
asleep?&rdquo; When Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a heard that, he said to
the king of Vatsa&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, she has been beguiled by that
Vidy&aacute;dhara wearing your form. He was found out by me by means of
my magic power, and now I have exhibited him before your eyes, but you
cannot kill him on account of his heavenly might.&rdquo; After saying
this, he and the king approached her, and Kalingasen&aacute;, for her
part, seeing them, stood in a respectful attitude. But when she began
to say to the king&mdash;&ldquo;Where, O king, did you go only a moment
ago, so as to return with your
minister?&rdquo;&mdash;Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Kalingasen&aacute;, you have been married by some
being, who beguiled you by assuming the shape of the king of Vatsa, and
not by this lord of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kalingasen&aacute; heard this, she was bewildered, and as if
pierced through the heart by an arrow, she said to the king of Vatsa
with tear-streaming eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;Have you forgotten me, O king,
after marrying me by the G&aacute;ndharva rite, as
&#346;akuntal&aacute; long ago was forgotten by
Dushyanta?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7574src" href="#xd27e7574"
name="xd27e7574src">6</a> When the king was thus addressed by her, he
said with downcast face, &ldquo;In truth you were not married by me,
for I never came here till this moment.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>When
the king of Vatsa had said this, the minister said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Come along&rdquo;&mdash;and conducted him at will to
the palace.</p>
<p>When the king had departed thence with his minister, that lady
Kalingasen&aacute;, sojourning in a foreign country, like a doe that
had strayed from the herd, having deserted her relations, with her face
robbed of its painting by kissing, as a lotus is robbed of its leaves
by cropping, having her braided tresses disordered, even as a bed of
lotuses trampled by an elephant has its cluster of black bees
dispersed; now that her maidenhood was gone for ever, not knowing what
expedient to adopt or what course to pursue, looked up to heaven and
spake as follows&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever that was that assumed the shape
of the king of Vatsa and married me, let him appear, for he is the
husband of my youth.&rdquo; When invoked in these words, that king of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas descended from heaven, of divine shape, adorned
with necklace and bracelet. And when she asked him who he was, he
answered her;&mdash;&ldquo;I, fair one, am a prince of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Madanavega. And long ago I beheld you in your
father&rsquo;s house, and by performing penance obtained a boon from
&#346;iva, which conferred on me the attainment of you. So, as you were
in love with the king of Vatsa, I assumed his form, and quickly married
you by stealth, before your contract with him had been
celebrated.&rdquo; By the nectar of this speech of his, entering her
ears, the lotus of her heart was a little revived. Then Madanavega
comforted that fair one, and made her recover her composure, and
bestowed on her a heap of gold, and when she had conceived in her heart
affection for her excellent husband, as being well suited to her, he
flew up into the heaven to return again. And Kalingasen&aacute;, after
obtaining permission from Madanavega, consented to dwell patiently
where she was, reflecting that the heavenly home, the abode of her
husband, could not be approached by a mortal, and that through passion
she had left her father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p class="first">Then the king of Vatsa, thinking on the peerless
beauty of Kalingasen&aacute;, was one night seized with love, so he
rose up and went sword in hand, and entered her palace alone; and she
welcomed him and received him politely. Then the king asked her to
become his wife, but she rejected his addresses, saying, &ldquo;You
should regard me as the wife of another.&rdquo; Whereupon he
answered&mdash;&ldquo;Since you are unchaste as having resorted to
three men, I shall not by approaching you incur the guilt of
adultery.&rdquo; When the king said this to Kalingasen&aacute;, she
answered him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>&ldquo;I came to marry you, O king, but I was
married by the Vidy&aacute;dhara Madanavega at his will, for he assumed
your shape. And he is my only husband, so why am I unchaste? But such
are the misfortunes even of ordinary women who desert their relations,
having their minds bewildered with the love of lawless roaming, much
more of princesses? And this is the fruit of my own folly in sending a
messenger to you, though I had been warned not to do so by my friend,
who had seen an evil omen. So if you touch me by force, I will abandon
life, for what woman of good family will injure her husband? And to
prove this I will tell you a tale&mdash;listen O king.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The story of king Indradatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in old time in the land of Chedi a great
king called Indradatta, he founded for his glory a great temple at the
holy bathing-place of P&aacute;pa&#347;odhana, desiring the body of
good reputation, as he saw that our mortal body is perishable. And the
king in the ardour of his devotion was continually going to visit it,
and all kinds of people were continually coming there to bathe in the
holy water. Now, one day the king saw a merchant&rsquo;s wife, whose
husband was travelling in foreign parts, who had come there to bathe in
the holy water; she was steeped in the nectar of pure beauty, and
adorned with various charms, like a splendid moving palace of the god
of Love. She was embraced on both her feet by the radiance of the two
quivers of the five-arrowed god,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7599src"
href="#xd27e7599" name="xd27e7599src">1</a> as if out of love,
believing that with her he would conquer the world.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7604src" href="#xd27e7604" name="xd27e7604src">2</a> The
moment the king saw her, she captivated his soul so entirely that,
unable to restrain himself, he found out her house and went there at
night. And when he solicited her, she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;You are
a protector of the helpless, you ought not to touch another man&rsquo;s
wife. And if you lay violent hands on me, you will commit a great sin;
and I will die immediately, I will not endure disgrace.&rdquo; Though
she said this to him, the king still endeavoured to use force to her,
whereupon her heart broke in a moment through fear of losing her
chastity. When the king saw that, he was at once abashed, and went back
by the way that he came, and in a few days died out of remorse for that
crime.</p>
<p>Having told this tale, Kalingasen&aacute; bowed in timid modesty,
and again said to the king of Vatsa&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore, king, set
not your heart on wickedness that would rob me of breath; since I have
come here, allow me to dwell here; if not, I will depart to some other
place.&rdquo; Then the king of Vatsa, who knew what was right, hearing
this from Kalingasen&aacute;, after reflecting, desisted from his
intention, and said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Princess, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>dwell here at will with this husband of yours; I
will not say anything to you, henceforth fear not.&rdquo; When the king
had said this, he returned of his own accord to his house, and
Madanavega, having heard the conversation, descended from heaven, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;My beloved, you have done well, if you had not acted
thus, O fortunate one, good fortune would not have resulted, for I
should not have tolerated your conduct.&rdquo; When the
Vidy&aacute;dhara had said this, he comforted her, and passed the night
there, and continued going to her house and returning again. And
Kalingasen&aacute;, having a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas for her
husband, remained there, blessed even in her mortal state with the
enjoyment of heavenly pleasures. As for the king of Vatsa, he ceased to
think about her, and remembering the speech of his minister, he
rejoiced, considering that he had saved his queens and kingdom and also
his son. And the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and the minister
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
were at ease, having reaped the fruit of the wishing-tree of
policy.</p>
<p>Then, as days went on, Kalingasen&aacute; had the lotus of her face
a little pale, and was pregnant, having longing produced in her. Her
lofty breasts, with extremities a little dark, appeared like the
treasure-vessels of Love, marked with his seal of joy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7616src" href="#xd27e7616" name="xd27e7616src">3</a>
Then her husband Madanavega came to her and said,
&ldquo;Kalingasen&aacute;, we heavenly beings are subject to this law,
that, when a mortal child is conceived we must abandon it, and go afar.
Did not Menak&aacute; leave &#346;akuntal&aacute; in the hermitage of
Kanva? And though you were formerly an Apsaras, you have now, goddess,
become a mortal by the curse of &#346;iva, inflicted on account of your
disobedience. Thus it has come to pass that, though chaste, you have
incurred the reproach of unchastity; so guard your offspring, I will go
to my own place. And whenever you think upon me, I will appear to
you.&rdquo; Thus the prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas spake to the
weeping Kalingasen&aacute;, and consoled her, and gave her a heap of
valuable jewels, and departed with his mind fixed on her, drawn away by
the law. Kalingasen&aacute;, for her part, remained there; supported by
the hope of offspring as by a friend, protected by the shade of the
king of Vatsa&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the husband of Ambik&aacute;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7624src" href="#xd27e7624" name="xd27e7624src">4</a> gave the
following order to Rati, the wife of the god of Love, who had performed
penance in order to get back her husband with his body restored:
&ldquo;That husband of thine who was formerly consumed, has been born
in the palace of the king of Vatsa, under the name of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, conceived in a mortal womb on account of
disrespect shewn to me. But because thou hast propitiated me, thou
shalt also be born in the world of mortals, without being conceived in
a mortal womb; and then thou shalt be reunited to thy husband, once
more possessing a body.&rdquo; Having said this to Rati, &#346;iva then
gave this command <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"
name="pb305">305</a>]</span>to the Creator;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7631src" href="#xd27e7631" name="xd27e7631src">5</a>
&ldquo;Kalingasen&aacute; shall give birth to a son of divine origin.
By thy power of illusion thou shalt remove her son, and substitute in
his place this very Rati, who shall abandon her heavenly body, and be
moulded by thee in the form of a mortal maiden.&rdquo; The Creator, in
obedience to the order of &#346;iva,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7634src" href="#xd27e7634" name="xd27e7634src">6</a> went down to
earth, and when the appointed time came, Kalingasen&aacute; gave birth
to a son. The Creator abstracted, by his divine power of illusion, her
son, the moment he was born, and substituted Rati, whom he had turned
into a girl, in his place, without the change being detected. And all
present there saw that girl born, and she seemed like the streak of the
new moon suddenly rising in broad daylight, for she illuminated with
her splendour the lying-in chamber, and eclipsing the long row of
flames of the jewel-lamps<a class="noteref" id="n305.3src" href=
"#n305.3" name="n305.3src">7</a> robbed them of lustre, and made them,
as it were, abashed. Kalingasen&aacute;, when she saw that incomparable
daughter born, in her delight made greater rejoicing, than she would
have made at the birth of a son.</p>
<p>Then the king of Vatsa, with his queen and his ministers, heard that
such a lovely daughter had been born to Kalingasen&aacute;. And when
the king heard of it, he suddenly, under the impulsion of the god
&#346;iva, said to the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, in the presence
of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>;
&ldquo;I know, this Kalingasen&aacute; is a heavenly nymph, who has
fallen down to earth in consequence of a curse, and this daughter born
to her will also be heavenly, and of wonderful beauty. So this girl,
being equal in beauty to my son Narav&aacute;hanadatta, ought to be his
head-queen.&rdquo; When the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; heard that,
she said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;Great king, why do you suddenly say
this now? What similarity can there possibly be between this son of
yours, of pure descent by both lines, and the daughter of
Kalingasen&aacute;, a girl whose mother is unchaste.&rdquo; When the
king heard that, he reflected, and said, &ldquo;Truly, I do not say
this of myself, but some god seems to have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>entered into me, and to be forcing me to speak.
And I seem to hear a voice uttering these words from
heaven&mdash;&lsquo;This daughter of Kalingasen&aacute; is the
appointed wife of Narav&aacute;hanadatta.&rsquo; Moreover, that
Kalingasen&aacute; is a faithful wife, of good family; and her reproach
of unchastity has arisen from the influence of her actions in a former
birth.&rdquo; When the king had said this, the minister <span class=
"corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
spoke&mdash;&ldquo;We hear, king, that when the god of Love was
consumed, Rati performed asceticism. And &#346;iva granted to Rati, who
wished to recover her husband, the following boon: &lsquo;Thou shalt
assume the condition of a mortal, and be reunited to thy husband, who
has been born with a body in the world of mortals.&rsquo; Now, your son
has long ago been declared by a heavenly voice to be an incarnation of
K&aacute;ma, and Rati by the order of &#346;iva has to become incarnate
in mortal form. And the midwife said to me to-day&mdash;&lsquo;I
inspected previously the fetus when contained in the uterus, and then I
saw one quite different from what has now appeared. Having beheld this
marvel I have come here to tell you.&rsquo; This is what that woman
told me, and now this inspiration has come to you. So I am persuaded
that the gods have stolen the real child of Kalingasen&aacute; and
substituted this daughter not born in the ordinary way, who is no other
than Rati, ordained beforehand to be the wife of your son, who is an
incarnation of K&aacute;ma, O king. To illustrate this, hear the
following story concerning a Yaksha.&rdquo;</p>

title="Source: Vir&uacute;paksha">Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha</span>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The god of wealth had for servant a Yaksha, named
Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha, who had been appointed chief guardian of
<i>lacs</i> of treasure.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7674src" href=
"#xd27e7674" name="xd27e7674src">8</a> And he delegated a certain
Yaksha to guard a treasure lying outside the town of Mathur&aacute;,
posted there like an immovable pillar of marble. And once on a time a
certain Br&aacute;hman, a votary of Pa&#347;upati, who made it his
business to exhume treasures, went there in search of hidden wealth.
While he was examining that place, with a candle made of human fat in
his hand, the candle fell from his grasp. By that sign he knew that
treasure was concealed there; and he attempted to dig it up with the
help of some other Br&aacute;hmans his friends. Then the Yaksha, who
was told off to guard that treasure, beholding that, came and related
the whole circumstance to Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha. And
Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha in his wrath gave the following command to the
Yaksha&mdash;&ldquo;Go and slay immediately those mean
treasure-hunters.&rdquo; Then the Yaksha went and slew by his power
those Br&aacute;hmans, who were digging for treasure, before they had
attained their object. Then the god of wealth came to hear of it, and
being angry he said to Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>&ldquo;Why did you, evil one, recklessly order
the slaughter of a Br&aacute;hman? What will not poor people, who are
struggling for a livelihood,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7724src" href=
"#xd27e7724" name="xd27e7724src">9</a> do out of desire for gain? But
they must be prevented by being terrified with various bug-bears, they
must not be slain.&rdquo; When the god of Wealth had said this, he
cursed that Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha as follows&mdash;&ldquo;Be born as
a mortal on account of your wicked conduct.&rdquo; Then that
Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha, smitten with the curse, was born on the earth
as the son of a certain Br&aacute;hman who lived on a royal grant. Then
the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; his wife implored the lord of wealth,
&ldquo;O god, send me whither my husband has gone; be merciful to me,
for I cannot live without him.&rdquo; When the virtuous lady addressed
this prayer to him, Vai&#347;ravana said&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt
descend, without being born, into the house of a female slave of that
very Br&aacute;hman, in whose house thy husband is born. There thou
shalt be united to that husband of thine, and by thy power he shall
surmount his curse and return to my service.&rdquo; In accordance with
this decree of Vai&#347;ravana, that virtuous wife became a mortal
maiden, and fell at the door of that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s female
slave&rsquo;s house. And the slave suddenly saw that maiden of
marvellous beauty, and took her and exhibited her to her master the
Br&aacute;hman. And the Br&aacute;hman rejoiced, and said to the female
slave&mdash;&ldquo;This is without doubt some heavenly maiden not born
in the ordinary way; so my soul tells me. Bring here this girl who has
entered your house, for, I think, she deserves to be my son&rsquo;s
wife.&rdquo; Then in course of time that girl and the son of the
Br&aacute;hman, having grown up, were smitten with ardent reciprocal
affection at the sight of one another. Then they were married by the
Br&aacute;hman; and the couple, though they did not remember their
previous births, felt as if a long separation had been brought to an
end. Then at last the Yaksha died, and as his wife burnt herself with
his mortal body, his sins were wiped away by her sufferings, and he
regained his former rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, you see, heavenly beings, on account of certain causes,
descend from heaven to the earth, by the appointment of fate, and,
because they are free from sin, they are not born in the usual way.
What does this girl&rsquo;s family matter to you? So this daughter of
Kalingasen&aacute; is, as I said, the wife appointed for your son by
destiny.&rdquo; When Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a had said this to the
king of Vatsa and the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, they both
consented in their hearts that it should be so. Then the prime minister
returned to his house, and the king, in the company of his wife, spent
the day happily, in drinking and other enjoyments.</p>
<p>Then, as time went on, that daughter of Kalingasen&aacute;, who had
lost her recollection of her former state through illusion, gradually
grew up, and her dower of beauty grew with her; and her mother and her
attendants gave her the name of Madanamanchuk&aacute;, because she was
the daughter of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span>Madanavega, saying, &ldquo;Surely the
beauty of all other lovely women has fled to her; else how could they
have become ugly before her?&rdquo; And the queen
V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, hearing she was beautiful, one day had her
brought into her presence out of curiosity. Then the king and
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a and his fellows beheld her clinging to the
face of her nurse, as the candle-flame clings to the wick. And there
was no one present, who did not think that she was an incarnation of
Rati, when they beheld her matchless body, which was like nectar to
their eyes. And then the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; brought there
her son Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was a feast to the eyes of the
world. He beheld, with the lotus of his face expanded, the gleaming
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, as the bed of water-lilies beholds the young
splendour of the sun. The girl gazed with dilated countenance upon that
gladdener of the eyes, and could not gaze enough, as the female
partridge can never be sated with gazing on the moon. Henceforth these
two children could not remain apart even for a moment, being, as it
were, fastened together with the nooses of glances.</p>
<p>But, in course of time, the king of Vatsa came to the conclusion
that that marriage was made in heaven,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7738src" href="#xd27e7738" name="xd27e7738src">10</a> and turned
his mind to the solemnization of the nuptials. When Kalingasen&aacute;
heard that, she rejoiced, and fixed her affection upon
Narav&aacute;hanadatta out of love for her daughter&rsquo;s future
husband. And then the king of Vatsa, after deliberating with his
ministers, had made for his son a separate palace like his own. Then
that king, who could discern times and seasons, collected the necessary
utensils, and anointed his son as crown-prince, since it was apparent
that he possessed all praiseworthy qualities. First there fell on his
head the water of his father&rsquo;s tears, and then the water of holy
bathing-places, purified by Vaidik spells of mickle might. When the
lotus of his face was washed with the water of inauguration, wonderful
to say, the faces of the cardinal points became also clear. When his
mothers threw on him the flowers of the auspicious garlands, the heaven
immediately shed a rain of many celestial wreaths. As if in emulation
of the thunder of the drums of the gods, the echoes of the sound of the
cymbals of rejoicing floated in the air. Every one there bowed before
him, as soon as he was inaugurated as crown-prince; then by that alone
he was exalted, without his own power.</p>
<p>Then the king of Vatsa summoned the good sons of the ministers, who
were the playfellows of his son, and appointed them to their offices as
servants to the crown-prince. He appointed to the office of prime
minister Marubh&uacute;ti the son of Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and
then Hari&#347;ikha the son of Ruma&#7751;vat to the office of
commander-in-chief, and he appointed Tapantaka the son of Vasantaka as
the companion of his lighter hours, and Gomukha the son of Ityaka to
the duty of chamberlain and warder, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>and to the office of
domestic chaplains the two sons of Pingalik&aacute;,
Vai&#347;v&aacute;nara and &#346;&aacute;ntisoma, the nephews of the
king&rsquo;s family priest. When these men had been appointed by the
king servants to his son, there was heard from heaven a voice preceded
by a rain of flowers: &ldquo;These ministers shall accomplish all
things prosperously for the prince, and Gomukha shall be his
inseparable companion.&rdquo; When the heavenly voice had said this,
the delighted king of Vatsa honoured them all with clothes and
ornaments; and while that king was showering wealth upon his
dependents, none of them could claim the title of poor on account of
the accumulation of riches. And the city was filled with dancing girls
and minstrels, who seemed to be invited by the rows of silken streamers
fanned and agitated by the wind.</p>
<p>Then Kalingasen&aacute; came to the feast of her future son-in-law,
looking like the Fortune of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race which was to
attend him, present in bodily form. Then V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute; and she danced, all three of them, for joy,
like the three powers<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7747src" href=
"#xd27e7747" name="xd27e7747src">11</a> of a king united together. And
all the trees there seemed to dance, as their creepers waved in the
wind, much more did the creatures possessing sense.</p>
<p>Then the crown-prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having been
inaugurated in his office, ascended an elephant of victory, and went
forth. And he was sprinkled by the city wives with their upcast eyes,
blue, white and red, resembling offerings of blue lotuses, parched
grain and water-lilies. And after visiting the gods worshipped in that
city, being praised by heralds and minstrels, he entered his palace
with his ministers. Then Kalingasen&aacute; gave him, to begin with,
celestial viands and drinks far exceeding what his own magnificence
could supply, and she presented to him and his ministers, friends and
servants, beautiful robes and heavenly ornaments, for she was
overpowered with love for her son-in-law. So the day passed in high
festivity for all these, the king of Vatsa and the others, charming as
the taste of nectar.</p>
<p>Then the night arrived, and Kalingasen&aacute; pondering over her
daughter&rsquo;s marriage, called to mind her friend Somaprabh&aacute;.
No sooner had she called to mind the daughter of the Asura Maya, than
her husband, the much-knowing Na&#7693;ak&uacute;vara, thus addressed
that noble lady, his wife&mdash;&ldquo;Dear one, Kalingasen&aacute; is
now thinking on thee with longing, therefore go and make a heavenly
garden for her daughter.&rdquo; Having said this, and revealed the
future and the past history of that maiden, her husband dismissed that
instant his wife Somaprabh&aacute;. And when she arrived, her friend
Kalingasen&aacute; threw her arms around her neck, having missed her so
long, and Somaprabh&aacute;, after asking after her health, said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;You have been married <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>by a
Vidy&aacute;dhara of great power, and your daughter is an incarnation
of Rati by the favour of &#346;iva, and she has been brought into the
world as the wife, in a previous state of existence, of an incarnation
of Love, that has taken his birth from the king of Vatsa. He shall be
emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas for a <i>kalpa</i> of the gods; and
she shall be honoured above his other wives. But you have descended
into this world, being an Apsaras degraded by the curse of Indra, and
after you have brought your duties to completion, you shall obtain
deliverance from your curse. All this was told me, my friend, by my
wise husband, so you must not be anxious; you will enjoy every
prosperity. And I will now make here for your daughter a heavenly
garden, the like of which does not exist on earth, in heaven, or in the
nether regions.&rdquo; Having said this, Somaprabh&aacute; made a
heavenly garden by her magic power, and taking leave of the regretful
Kalingasen&aacute;, she departed. Then, at the dawn of day, people
beheld that garden, looking like the garden of Nandana suddenly fallen
down from heaven to earth. Then the king of Vatsa heard of it, and came
there with his wives and his ministers, and Narav&aacute;hanadatta with
his companions. And they beheld that garden, the trees of which bore
both flowers and fruits all the year round,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7770src" href="#xd27e7770" name="xd27e7770src">12</a> with many
jewelled pillars, walls, lawns, and tanks; with birds of the colour of
gold, with heavenly perfumed breezes, like a second Svarga descended to
earth from the region of the gods. The lord of Vatsa, when he saw that
wonderful sight, asked Kalingasen&aacute;, who was intent on
hospitality, what it was. And she thus answered the king in the hearing
of all: &ldquo;There is a great Asura, Maya by name, an incarnation of
Vi&#347;vakarman, who made the assembly-hall of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7773" title="Source: Yudhisthira">Yudhish&#7789;hira</span>, and
the city of Indra: he has a daughter, Somaprabh&aacute; by name, who is
a friend of mine. She came here at night to visit me, and out of love
made this heavenly garden by her magic power, for the sake of my
daughter.&rdquo; After saying this, she told all the past and future
fortunes of her daughter, which Somaprabh&aacute; had revealed to her,
letting the king know that she had heard them from her friend. Then all
there, perceiving that the speech of Kalingasen&aacute; tallied with
what they previously knew, dismissed their doubts and were exceedingly
delighted. And the king of Vatsa, with his wives and his son, spent
that day in the garden, being hospitably entertained by
Kalingasen&aacute;.</p>
<p>The next day, the king went to visit a god in a temple, and he saw
many women well-clothed and with beautiful ornaments. And when he asked
them who they were, they said to him&mdash;&ldquo;We are the sciences,
and these are the accomplishments; and we are come here on account of
your son: we shall now go and enter into him.&rdquo; Having said this
they disappeared, and the king of Vatsa entered his house astonished.
There he told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>it to the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute; and to
the circle of his ministers, and they rejoiced at that favour of the
deity. Then V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, by the direction of the king,
took up a lyre as soon as Narav&aacute;hanadatta entered the room. And
while his mother was playing, Narav&aacute;hanadatta said modestly to
her, &ldquo;This lyre is out of tune.&rdquo; His father said,
&ldquo;Take it, and play on it,&rdquo; whereupon he played upon the
lyre so as to astonish even the Gandharvas. When he was thus tested by
his father in all the sciences and the accomplishments, he became
endowed with them all, and of himself knew all knowledge. When the king
of Vatsa beheld his son endowed with all talents, he taught
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, the daughter of Kalingasen&aacute;, dancing. As
fast as she became perfect in accomplishments,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7780src" href="#xd27e7780" name="xd27e7780src">13</a> the heart
of the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta was disturbed. So the sea is
disturbed, as fast as the orb of the moon rounds off its digits. And he
delighted in beholding her singing and dancing, accomplished in all the
gestures of the body, so that she seemed to be reciting the decrees of
Love. As for her, if she did not see for a moment that nectar-like
lover, the tears rose to her eyes, and she was like a bed of white
lotuses, wet with dew at the hour of dawn.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7786src" href="#xd27e7786" name="xd27e7786src">14</a> And
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, being unable to live without continually
beholding her face, came to that garden of hers. There he remained, and
Kalingasen&aacute; out of affection did all she could to please him,
bringing her daughter to him. And Gomukha, who saw into his
master&rsquo;s heart, and wished to bring about his long stay there,
used to tell various tales to Kalingasen&aacute;. The king was
delighted by his friend&rsquo;s penetrating his intentions, for seeing
into one&rsquo;s lord&rsquo;s soul is the surest way of winning him.
And Narav&aacute;hanadatta himself perfected Madanamanchuk&aacute; in
dancing and other accomplishments, giving her lessons in a concert-hall
that stood in the garden, and while his beloved danced, he played on
all instruments so as to put to the blush the most skilful minstrels.
And he conquered also various professors that came from all quarters,
and were skilful in managing elephants, horses, and chariots, in the
use of hand-to-hand and missile weapons, in painting and
modelling.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7789src" href="#xd27e7789" name=
"xd27e7789src">15</a> In these amusements passed during childhood the
days of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was the chosen bridegroom of
Science.</p>
<p>Now, once on a time the prince, with his ministers, and accompanied
by his beloved, went on a pilgrimage to a garden called
N&aacute;gavana. There a certain merchant&rsquo;s wife fell in love
with Gomukha, and being repulsed, tried to kill him by offering to him
a poisoned drink. But Gomukha came to hear of it from the lips of her
confidante, and did not take that drink, but broke out into the
following denunciation of women: &ldquo;Alas! the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>Creator first created recklessness, and then
women in imitation of it; by nature nothing is too bad for them to do.
Surely this being they call woman, is created of nectar and poison,
for, when she is attached to one, she is nectar, and when estranged she
is indeed poison. Who can see through a woman, with loving face
secretly planning crime? A wicked woman is like a lotus-bed with its
flowers expanded, and an alligator concealed in it. But now and then
there falls from heaven, urging on a host of virtues, a good woman that
brings praise to her husband, like the pure light of the sun. But
another, of evil augury, attached to strangers, not free from
inordinate desires, wicked, bearing the poison of aversion,<a class=

<h3 class="main">Story of &#346;atrughna and his wicked wife.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For instance, in a certain village there was a certain
man named &#346;atrughna, and his wife was unchaste. He once saw in the
evening his wife in the society of her lover, and he slew that lover of
hers, when he was in the house, with the sword. And he remained at the
door waiting for the night, keeping his wife inside, and at night-fall
a traveller came there to ask for a lodging. He gave him refuge, and
artfully carried away with his help the corpse of that adulterer at
night, and went with it to the forest. And there, while he was throwing
that corpse into a well, the mouth of which was overgrown with plants,
his wife came behind him, and pushed him in also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reckless crime of this kind will not a wicked wife
commit?&rdquo; In these words Gomukha, though still a boy, denounced
the conduct of women.</p>
<p>Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta himself worshipped the snakes in that
grove of snakes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7811src" href="#xd27e7811"
name="xd27e7811src">17</a> and went back to his palace with his
retinue.</p>
<p>While he was there, he desired one day to prove his ministers,
Gomukha and the others, so he asked them, though he himself knew it
well, for a summary of the policy of princes. They consulted among
themselves, and said&mdash;&ldquo;You know all things, nevertheless we
will tell you this, now that you ask us,&rdquo; and so they proceeded
to relate the cream of political science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king should first tame and mount the horses of the senses,
and should conquer those internal foes, love, anger, avarice and
delusion, and should subdue himself as a preparation for subduing other
enemies, for how can a man, who has not conquered himself, being
helpless, conquer others? Then he should procure ministers, who, among
other good qualities, possess that of being natives of his own country,
and a skilful family priest, knowing the Atharva Veda, gifted with
asceticism. He should test his ministers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>with respect to fear,
avarice, virtue and passion, by ingenious artifices, and then he should
appoint them to appropriate duties, discerning their hearts. He should
try their speech, when they are deliberating with one another on
affairs, to see if it is truthful, or inspired by malice, spoken out of
affection, or connected with selfish objects. He should be pleased with
truth, but should punish untruth as it deserves, and he should
continually inquire into the conduct of each of them by means of spies.
Thus he should look at business with unhooded eye, and by rooting up
opponents,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7827src" href="#xd27e7827" name=
"xd27e7827src">18</a> and acquiring a treasure, a force, and the other
means of success, should establish himself firmly on the throne. Then,
equipped with the three powers of courage, kingly authority, and
counsel, he should be eager to conquer the territory of others,
considering the difference between the power of himself and his foe. He
should continually take counsel with advisers, who should be trusty,
learned and wise, and should correct with his own intellect the policy
determined on by them, in all its details. Being versed in the means of
success,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7830src" href="#xd27e7830" name=
"xd27e7830src">19</a> (conciliation, bribery and the others,) he should
attain for himself security, and he should then employ the six proper
courses, of which alliance and war are the chief.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7839src" href="#xd27e7839" name="xd27e7839src">20</a> Thus a king
acquires prosperity, and as long as he carefully considers his own
realm and that of his rival, he is victorious but never vanquished. But
an ignorant monarch, blind with passion and avarice, is plundered by
wicked servants, who shew him the wrong path, and leading him astray,
fling him into pits. On account of these rogues a servant of another
kind is never admitted into the presence of the king, as a husbandman
cannot get at a crop of rice enclosed with a palisade. For he is
enslaved by those faithless servants, who penetrate into his secrets;
and consequently Fortune in disgust flies from him, because he does not
know the difference between man and man. Therefore a king should
conquer himself, should inflict due chastisement, and know the
difference of men&rsquo;s characters, for in this way he will acquire
his subjects&rsquo; love and become thereby a vessel of
prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">In old time a king named &#346;&uacute;rasena, who
relied implicitly upon his servants, was enslaved and plundered by his
ministers, who had formed a coalition. Whoever was a faithful servant
to the king, the ministers would not give even a straw to, though the
king wished to bestow a reward upon him; but if any man was a faithful
servant to them, they themselves gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

their representations induced the king to give to him, though he was

that coalition of rogues, and set those ministers at variance with one
another by a clever artifice. When they were estranged, and the clique
was broken up, and they began to inform against one another, the king
ruled the realm successfully, without being deceived by others.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Harisinha.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And there was a king named Harisinha, of ordinary
power but versed in the true science of policy, who had surrounded
himself with devoted and wise ministers, possessed forts, and stores of
wealth; he made his subjects devoted to him and conducted himself in
such a way that, though attacked by an emperor, he was not
defeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus discernment and reflection are the main things in
governing a kingdom; what is of more importance?&rdquo; Having said
this, each taking his part, Gomukha and his fellows ceased.
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, approving that speech of theirs, though he knew
that heroic action is to be thought upon,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7859src" href="#xd27e7859" name="xd27e7859src">21</a> still
placed his reliance upon destiny whose power surpasses all thought.</p>
<p>Then he rose up, and his ardour being kindled by delay, he went with
them to visit his beloved Madanamanchuk&aacute;; when he had reached
her palace and was seated on a throne, Kalingasen&aacute;, after
performing the usual courtesies, said with astonishment to
Gomukha,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7867src" href="#xd27e7867" name=
"xd27e7867src">22</a> &ldquo;Before the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta
arrived, Madanamanchuk&aacute;, being impatient, went up to the top of
the palace to watch him coming, accompanied by me, and while we were
there, a man descended from heaven upon it, he was of divine
appearance, wore a tiara, and a sword, and said to me &lsquo;I am a
king, a lord of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named M&aacute;nasavega, and you
are a heavenly nymph named Surabhidatt&aacute; who by a curse have
fallen down to earth, and this your daughter is of heavenly origin,
this is known to me well. So give me this daughter of yours in
marriage, for the connexion is a suitable one.&rsquo; When he said
this, I suddenly burst out laughing, and said to him,
&lsquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta has been appointed her husband by the
gods, and he is to be the emperor of all you Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rsquo;
When I said this to him, the Vidy&aacute;dhara flew up into the sky,
like a sudden streak of lightning dazzling the eyes of my
daughter.&rdquo; When Gomukha heard that, he said, &ldquo;The
Vidy&aacute;dharas found out that the prince was to be their future
lord, from a speech in the air, by which the future birth of the prince
was made known to the king in private, and they immediately desired to
do him a mischief. What self-willed one would desire a mighty lord as
his ruler and restrainer? For which reason <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>&#346;iva has made arrangements to ensure the
safety of this prince, by commissioning his attendants to wait on him
in actual presence. I heard this speech of N&aacute;rada&rsquo;s being
related by my father. So it comes to pass that the Vidy&aacute;dharas
are now hostile to us.&rdquo; When Kalingasen&aacute; heard this, she
was terrified at the thought of what had happened to herself, and said,
&ldquo;Why does not the prince marry Madanamanchuk&aacute; now, before
she is deceived, like me, by delusion?&rdquo; When Gomukha and the
others heard this from Kalingasen&aacute;, they said, &ldquo;Do you
stir up the king of Vatsa to this business.&rdquo; Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with his heart fixed on Madanamanchuk&aacute;
only, amused himself by looking at her in the garden all that day, with
her face like a full-blown lotus, with her eyes like opening blue
water-lilies, with lips lovely as the <i>bandh&uacute;ka</i>, with
breasts like clusters of <i>mand&aacute;ras</i>, with body delicate as
the <i>&#347;ir&iacute;sha</i>, like a matchless arrow, composed of
five flowers, appointed by the god of love for the conquest of the
world.</p>
<p>The next day Kalingasen&aacute; went in person, and proffered her
petition to the king for the marriage of her daughter. The king of
Vatsa dismissed her, and summoning his ministers, said to them in the
presence of the queen V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;,
&ldquo;Kalingasen&aacute; is impatient for the marriage of her
daughter: so how are we to manage it, for the people think that that
excellent woman is unchaste? And we must certainly consider the people:
did not R&aacute;mabhadra long ago desert queen S&iacute;t&aacute;,
though she was chaste, on account of the slander of the multitude? Was
not Amb&aacute;, though carried off with great effort by Bh&iacute;shma
for the sake of his brother, reluctantly abandoned, because she had
previously chosen another husband? In the same way this
Kalingasen&aacute;, after spontaneously choosing me, was married by
Madanavega; for this reason the people blame her. Therefore let this
Narav&aacute;hanadatta himself marry by the G&aacute;ndharva ceremony
her daughter, who will be a suitable wife for him.&rdquo; When the king
of Vatsa said this, <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>
answered, &ldquo;My lord, how could Kalingasen&aacute; consent to this
impropriety? For I have often observed that she, as well as her
daughter, is a divine being, no ordinary woman, and this was told me by
my wise friend the Br&aacute;hman-R&aacute;kshasa.&rdquo; While they
were debating with one another in this style, the voice of &#346;iva
was heard from heaven to the following effect: &ldquo;The god of love,
after having been consumed by the fire of my eye, has been created
again in the form of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and having been pleased
with the asceticism of Rati I have created her as his wife in the form
of Madanamanchuk&aacute;. And dwelling with her, as his head-wife, he
shall exercise supreme sovereignty over the Vidy&aacute;dharas for a
<i>kalpa</i> of the gods, after conquering his enemies by my
favour.&rdquo; After saying this the voice ceased.</p>
<p>When he heard this speech of the adorable &#346;iva, the king of
Vatsa, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>with his retinue, worshipped him, and joyfully
made up his mind to celebrate the marriage of his son. Then the king
congratulated his prime minister, who had before discerned the truth,
and summoned the astrologers, and asked them what would be a favourable
moment, and they, after being honoured with presents, told him that a
favourable moment would arrive within a few days. Again those
astrologers said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Your son will have to endure some
separation for a short season from this wife of his; this we know, O
lord of Vatsa, by our own scientific foresight.&rdquo; Then the king
proceeded to make the requisite preparations for the marriage of his
son, in a style suited to his own magnificence, so that not only his
own city, but the whole earth was made to tremble with the effort of
it. Then, the day of marriage having arrived, Kalingasen&aacute;
adorned her daughter, to whom her father had sent his own heavenly
ornaments, and Somaprabh&aacute; came in obedience to her
husband&rsquo;s order. Then Madanamanchuk&aacute;, adorned with a
heavenly marriage thread, looked still more lovely; is not the moon
truly beautiful, when accompanied by K&aacute;rtika? And heavenly
nymphs, by the order of &#346;iva, sang auspicious strains in her
honour: they were eclipsed by her beauty and remained hidden as if
ashamed, but the sound of their songs was heard. They sang the
following hymn in honour of Gaur&iacute;, blended with the minstrelsy
of the matchless musicians of heaven, so as to make unequalled
harmony&mdash;&ldquo;Victory to thee, O daughter of the mountain, that
hast mercy on thy faithful votaries, for thou hast thyself come to-day
and blessed with success the asceticism of Rati.&rdquo; Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, resplendent with excellent marriage-thread,
entered the wedding-pavilion full of various musical instruments. And
the bride and bridegroom, after accomplishing the auspicious ceremony
of marriage, with intent care, so that no rite was left out, ascended
the altar-platform where a fire was burning, as if ascending the pure
flame of jewels on the heads of kings. If the moon and the sun were to
revolve at the same time round the mountain of gold,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7896src" href="#xd27e7896" name="xd27e7896src">23</a> there
would be an exact representation in the world of the appearance of
those two, the bride and the bridegroom, when circumambulating the
fire, keeping it on their right. Not only did the drums of the gods in
the air drown the cymbal-clang in honour of the marriage festival, but
the rain of flowers sent down by the gods overwhelmed the gilt grain
thrown by the women. Then also the generous Kalingasen&aacute; honoured
her son-in-law with heaps of gold studded with jewels, so that the lord
of Alak&aacute; was considered very poor compared with him, and much
more so all miserable earthly monarchs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>And then the bride
and bridegroom, now that the delightful ceremony of marriage was
accomplished in accordance with their long-cherished wishes, entered
the inner apartments crowded with women, adorned with pure and
variegated decoration, even as they penetrated the heart of the people
full of pure and various loyalty. Moreover, the city of the king of
Vatsa was quickly filled with kings, surrounded with splendid armies,
who, though their valour was worthy of the world&rsquo;s admiration,
had bent in submission, bringing in their hands valuable jewels by way
of presents, as if with subject seas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7903src" href="#xd27e7903" name="xd27e7903src">24</a> On that
high day of festival, the king distributed gold with such magnificence
to his dependants, that the children in their mothers&rsquo; wombs were
at any rate the only beings in his kingdom not made of gold.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7909src" href="#xd27e7909" name=
"xd27e7909src">25</a> Then on account of the troops of excellent
minstrels and dancing girls, that came from all quarters of the world,
with hymns, music, dances and songs on all sides, the world seemed full
of harmony. And at that festival the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; seemed itself to be dancing, for the
pennons agitated by the wind seemed like twining arms, and it was
beautified with the toilettes of the city matrons, as if with
ornaments. And thus waxing in mirth every day, that great festival
continued for a long time, and all friends, relations and people
generally were delighted by it, and had their wishes marvellously
fulfilled. And that crown-prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta, accompanied by
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, enjoyed, though intent on glory, the
long-desired pleasures of this world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&ldquo;Gregory mentions &lsquo;an ordinary superstition of the old

authorities to prove that it exists in Germany, Scotland, and Sweden.
In the latter country, it is considered dangerous to let the fire go
out until the child is baptized, for fear that the Trolls may
substitute a changeling in its place. The custom exists also in the
Malay Peninsula, and among the T&aacute;jiks in Bokhara. The Roman
custom of lighting a candle in the room of a lying-in woman, from which
the goddess Candelifera derived her name (Tertullian Adv. nation, 2,

<p class="footnote cont">It appears from Henderson&rsquo;s Folk-lore of
the Northern Counties, that in Europe a candle of human fat is used
with the Hand of Glory by robbers for the purpose of preventing the
inmates of a house from awaking. He gives several instances of its use.
The following will serve as a specimen: &ldquo;On the night of the 3rd
of January 1831, some Irish thieves attempted to commit a robbery on
the estate of Mr. Napier of Loughcrew, county Meath. They entered the
house armed with a dead man&rsquo;s hand with a lighted candle in it,
believing in the superstitious notion that a candle placed in a dead
man&rsquo;s hand will not be seen by any but those by whom it is used,
and also that if a candle in a dead hand be introduced into a house, it
will prevent those who may be asleep from awaking. The inmates however,
were alarmed, and the robbers fled, leaving the hand behind
them.&rdquo; The composition of the candle is evident from the
following extract from the Dictionnaire Infernal of Colin de Planey.
&ldquo;The Hand of Glory is the hand of a man who has been hanged, and
is prepared in the following manner. Wrap the hand in a piece of
winding-sheet, drawing it tight to squeeze out the little blood which
may remain; then place it in an earthen-ware vessel with saltpetre,
salt and long pepper all carefully and thoroughly powdered. Let it
remain a fortnight in this pickle till it is well dried, then expose it
to the sun in the dog-days till it is completely parched, or if the sun
be not powerful enough, dry it in an oven heated with vervain and fern.
Next make <i>a candle with the fat of a hanged man</i>, virgin wax, and
Lapland sesame. The Hand of Glory is used to hold this candle when it
is lighted. Wherever one goes with this contrivance, those it
approaches are rendered as incapable of motion as though they were
dead.&rdquo; Southey in Book V of his Thalaba the Destroyer represents
a hand and taper of this kind as used to lull to sleep Zohak, the giant
keeper of the caves of Babylon. (See the extracts from Grose and
Torquemada in the notes to Southey&rsquo;s poem.) Dousterswivel in Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s Antiquary tells us that the monks used the Hand of
Glory to conceal their treasures. (Henderson&rsquo;s Folk-lore of the
Northern Counties of England and the Borders, p. 200 and ff.)</p>

title="Not in source">The author of Sagas from the Far East remarks;
&ldquo;Serpent-Cultus was of very ancient observance, and is practised
by both followers of Br&aacute;hmanism and Buddhism. The
Br&aacute;hmans seem to have desired to show their disapproval of it by
placing the serpent-gods in the lower ranks of their mythology,
(Lassen. I, 707 and 544, n. 2). This cultus, however, seems to have
received a fresh development about the time of A&#347;oka <i>circa</i>
250 B. C. (Vol. II, p. 467). When Madhyantika went into Cashmere and
Gandh&aacute;ra to teach Buddhism after the holding of the third synod,
it is mentioned that he found sacrifices to serpents practised there
(II. 234, 235). There is a passage in Plutarch from which it appears to
have been the custom to sacrifice an old woman (previously condemned to
death for some crime) to the serpent-gods by burying her alive on the
banks of the Indus (II. 467, note 4) Ktesias also mentions the serpent
worship (II. 642). In Buddhist legends serpents are often mentioned as
protecting patrons of certain towns. (Sagas from the Far East, p. 355).

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a mountain-chain called Himavat, famous in
the three worlds; it has many peaks, but one of its peaks is the mount
of &#346;iva which is garlanded with the brightness of glittering
jewels, and flashes with gleaming snow, and like the expanse of the
heaven, cannot be measured. Its plateaux are the home of magic powers
and of magic herbs, which dispel old age, death, and fear, and are to
be obtained by the favour of &#346;iva. With its peaks yellow with the
brightness of the bodies of many Vidy&aacute;dharas, it transcends the
glory of the peaks of Sumeru itself, the mighty hill of the
immortals.</p>
<p>On it there is a golden city called
K&aacute;nchana&#347;&#7771;inga, which gleams refulgent with
brightness, like the palace of the Sun. It extends many <i>yojanas</i>,
and in it there lives a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named
Hemaprabha, who is a firm votary of the husband of Um&aacute;. And
though he has many wives, he has only one queen, whom he loves dearly,
named Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute;, as dear to him as
Rohi&#7751;&iacute; to the moon. With her the virtuous king used to
rise up in the morning and bathe, and worship duly &#346;iva and his
wife Gaur&iacute;, and then he would descend to the world of men, and
give to poor Br&aacute;hmans every day a thousand gold-pieces mixed
with jewels. And then he returned from earth and attended to his kingly
duties justly, and then he ate and drank, abiding by his vow like a
hermit. While days elapsed in this way, melancholy arose once in the
bosom of the king, caused by his childlessness, but suggested by a
passing occasion. And his beloved queen Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute;,
seeing that he was in very low spirits, asked him the cause of his
sadness. Then the king said to her&mdash;&ldquo;I have all prosperity,
but the one grief of childlessness afflicts me, O queen. And this
melancholy has arisen in my breast on the occasion of calling to mind a
tale, which I heard long ago, of a virtuous man who had no son.&rdquo;
Then the queen said to him, &ldquo;Of what nature was that tale?&rdquo;
When asked this question, the king told her the tale briefly in the
following words: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"

<h3 class="main">Story of Sattva&#347;&iacute;la and the two
treasures.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the town of Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a there was a
king named Br&aacute;hma&#7751;avara, rightly named, for he was devoted
to honouring Br&aacute;hmans. He had a victorious servant named
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la who devoted himself exclusively to war, and
every month Sattva&#347;&iacute;la received a hundred gold-pieces from
that king. But as he was munificent, that gold was not enough for him,
especially as his childlessness made the pleasure of giving the sole
pleasure to which he was addicted. Sattva&#347;&iacute;la was
continually reflecting&mdash;&ldquo;The Disposer has not given me a son
to gladden me, but he has given me the vice of generosity, and that too
without wealth. It is better to be produced in the world as an old
barren tree or a stone, than as a poor man altogether abandoned to the
vice of giving away money.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> But once on a time
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, while wandering in a garden, happened by luck
to find a treasure: and with the help of his servants he quickly
brought home that hoard, which gleamed with much gold and glittered
with priceless stones. Out of that he provided himself with pleasures,
and gave wealth to Br&aacute;hmans, slaves, and friends, and thus the
virtuous man spent his life. Meanwhile his relations, beholding this,
guessed the secret, and went to the king&rsquo;s palace, and of their
own accord informed the king that Sattva&#347;&iacute;la had found a
treasure. Then Sattva&#347;&iacute;la was summoned by the king, and by
order of the door-keeper remained standing for a moment in a lonely
part of the king&rsquo;s courtyard. There, as he was scratching the
earth with the hilt of a <i lang=
"sa-latn">l&iacute;l&aacute;vajra</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7995src" href="#xd27e7995" name="xd27e7995src">4</a> that was in
his hand, he found another large treasure in a copper vessel. It
appeared like his own heart, displayed openly for him by Destiny
pleased with his virtue, in order that he might propitiate the king
with it. So he covered it up again with earth as it was before, and
when summoned by the door-keeper, entered the king&rsquo;s presence.
When he had made his bow there, the king himself said, &ldquo;I have
come to learn that you have obtained a treasure, so surrender it to
me.&rdquo; And Sattva&#347;&iacute;la for his part answered him then
and there, &ldquo;O king, tell me: shall I give you the first treasure
I found, or the one I found to-day.&rdquo; The king said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Give the one recently found.&rdquo; And thereupon
Sattva&#347;&iacute;la went to a corner of the king&rsquo;s courtyard,
and gave him up the treasure. Then the king, being pleased with the
treasure, dismissed Sattva&#347;&iacute;la with these
words&mdash;&ldquo;Enjoy the first-found treasure as you please.&rdquo;
So Sattva&#347;&iacute;la returned to his house. There he remained
increasing the propriety of his name with gifts and enjoyments, and so
managing to dispel somehow or other the melancholy caused by the
affliction of childlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the story of Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, which I heard
long ago, and because I have recalled it to mind, I remain sorrowful
through thinking over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>fact that I have no son.&rdquo;
When the queen Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute; was thus addressed by her
husband Hemaprabha, the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, she answered
him, &ldquo;It is true: Fortune does assist the brave in this way; did
not Sattva&#347;&iacute;la, when in difficulties, obtain a second
treasure? So you too will obtain your desire by the power of your
courage, as an example of the truth of this, hear the story of
Vikramatunga.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the brave king Vikramatunga.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city called P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, the
ornament of the earth, filled with various beautiful jewels, the
colours of which are so disposed as to form a perfect scale of colour.
In that city there dwelt long ago a brave king, named Vikramatunga, who
in giving<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8013src" href="#xd27e8013" name=
"xd27e8013src">5</a> never turned his back on a suppliant, nor in
fighting on an enemy. That king one day entered the forest to hunt, and
saw there a Br&aacute;hman offering a sacrifice with
<i>vilva</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e8021src" href="#xd27e8021"
name="xd27e8021src">6</a> fruits. When he saw him, he was desirous to
question him, but avoided going near him, and went off to a great
distance with his army in his ardour for the chase. For a long time he
sported with deer and lions, that rose up and fell slain by his hand,
as if with foes, and then he returned and beheld the Br&aacute;hman
still intent on his sacrifice as before, and going up to him he bowed
before him, and asked him his name and the advantage he hoped to derive
from offering the <i>vilva</i> fruits. Then the Br&aacute;hman blessed
the king and said to him, &ldquo;I am a Br&aacute;hman named
N&aacute;ga&#347;arman, and bear the fruit I hope from my sacrifice.
When the god of Fire is pleased with this <i>vilva</i> sacrifice, then
<i>vilva</i> fruits of gold will come out of the fire-cavity. Then the
god of Fire will appear in bodily form and grant me a boon; and so I
have spent much time in offering <i>vilva</i> fruits. But so little is
my merit that even now the god of Fire is not propitiated.&rdquo; When
he said this, that king of resolute valour answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;Then give me one <i>vilva</i> fruit that I may offer
it, and I will to-day, O Br&aacute;hman, render the god of Fire
propitious to you.&rdquo; Then the Br&aacute;hman said to the king,
&ldquo;How will you, unchastened and impure, propitiate that god of
Fire, who is not satisfied with me, who remain thus faithful to my vow,
and am chastened?&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman said this to him, the
king said to him again, &ldquo;Never mind, give me a <i>vilva</i>
fruit, and in a moment you shall behold a wonder.&rdquo; Then the
Br&aacute;hman, full of curiosity, gave a <i>vilva</i> fruit to the
king, and he then and there meditated with soul of firm
valour&mdash;&ldquo;If thou art not satisfied with this <i>vilva</i>
fruit, O god of Fire, then I will offer thee my own head,&rdquo; and
thereupon offered the fruit. And the seven-rayed god appeared from the
sacrificial cavity, bringing the king a golden <i>vilva</i> fruit as
the fruit of his tree of valour. And the Fire-god, present in visible
form, said to that king&mdash;&ldquo;I am pleased <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>with
thy courage, so receive a boon, O king.&rdquo; When the magnanimous
king heard that, he bowed before him and said&mdash;&ldquo;Grant this
Br&aacute;hman his wish. What other boon do I require?&rdquo; On
hearing this speech of the king&rsquo;s, the Fire-god was much pleased
and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;O king, this Br&aacute;hman shall become a
great lord of wealth, and thou also by my favour shalt have the
prosperity of thy treasury ever undiminished.&rdquo; When the Fire-god
had, in these words, bestowed the boon, the Br&aacute;hman asked him
this question; &ldquo;Thou hast appeared swiftly to a king that acts
according to his own will, but not to me that am under vows: why is
this, O revered one?&rdquo; Then the Fire-god, the giver of boons,
answered&mdash;&ldquo;If I had not granted him an interview, this king
of fierce courage would have offered his head in sacrifice to me. In
this world successes quickly befall those of fierce spirit, but they
come slowly, O Br&aacute;hman, to those of dull spirit like
thee.&rdquo; Thus spake the god of Fire, and vanished, and the
Br&aacute;hman N&aacute;ga&#347;arman took leave of the king and in
course of time became very rich. But the king Vikramatunga, whose
courage had been thus seen by his dependents, returned amid their
plaudits to his town of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra.</p>
<p>When the king was dwelling there, the warder &#346;atrunjaya entered
suddenly one day, and said secretly to him; &ldquo;There is standing at
the door, O king, a Br&aacute;hman lad, who says his name is
Datta&#347;arman, he wishes to make a representation to you in
private.&rdquo; The king gave the order to introduce him, and the lad
was introduced, and after blessing the king, he bowed before him, and
sat down. And he made this representation&mdash;&ldquo;King, by a
certain device of powder I know how to make always excellent gold out
of copper. For that device was shewn me by my spiritual teacher, and I
saw with my own eyes that he made gold by that device.&rdquo; When the
lad said this, the king ordered copper to be brought, and when it was
melted, the lad threw the powder upon it. But while the powder was
being thrown, an invisible Yaksha carried it off, and the king alone
saw him, having propitiated the god of Fire. And that copper did not
turn into gold, as the powder did not reach it; thrice did the lad make
the attempt and thrice his labour was in vain. Then the king, first of
brave men, took the powder from the desponding lad, and himself threw
it on the melted copper; when he threw the powder, the Yaksha did not
intercept it, but went away smiling. Accordingly the copper became gold
by contact with that powder. Then the boy, astonished, asked the king
for an explanation, and the king told him the incident of the Yaksha,
just as he had seen it. And having learned in this way the device of
the powder from that lad, the king made him marry a wife, and gave him
all he wished, and having his treasury prosperously filled by means of
the gold produced by that device, he himself enjoyed great happiness
together with his wives, and made Br&aacute;hmans rich. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus you see that the Lord grants their desires to men of
fierce courage, seeming to be either terrified or pleased by them. And
who, O king, is of more firm valour or more generous than you? So
&#346;iva, when propitiated by you, will certainly give you a son; do
not sorrow.&rdquo; The king Hemaprabha, when he heard this noble speech
from the mouth of queen Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute;, believed it and
was pleased. And he considered that his own heart, radiant with
cheerfulness, indicated that he would certainly obtain a son by
propitiating &#346;iva. The next day after this, he and his wife bathed
and worshipped &#346;iva, and he gave 90 millions of gold-pieces to the
Br&aacute;hmans, and without taking food he went through ascetic
practices in front of &#346;iva, determined that he would either leave
the body or propitiate the god, and continuing in asceticism, he
praised the giver of boons, the husband of the daughter of the
mountain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8060src" href="#xd27e8060" name=
"xd27e8060src">7</a> that lightly gave away the sea of milk to his
votary Upamanyu, saying, &ldquo;Honour to thee, O husband of

<p>When the king had praised &#346;iva in these words and fasted for
three nights, the god appeared to him in a dream, and spake as follows:
&ldquo;Rise up, O king, there shall be born to thee a heroic son that
shall uphold thy race. And thou shalt also obtain by the favour of
Gaur&iacute;, a glorious daughter who is destined to be the queen of
that treasure-house of glory, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, your future
emperor.&rdquo; When &#346;iva had said this, he disappeared, and
Hemaprabha woke up, delighted, at the close of night. And by telling
his dream he gladdened his wife Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute;, who had
been told the same by Gaur&iacute; in a dream, and dwelt on the
agreement of the two visions. And then the king rose up and bathed and
worshipped &#346;iva, and after giving gifts, broke his fast, and kept
high festival.</p>
<p>Then, after some days had passed, the queen
Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute; became pregnant by that king, and
delighted her beloved by her face redolent of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>honey, with wildly rolling eyes, so that it
resembled a pale lotus with bees hovering round it. Then she gave birth
in due time to a son, (whose noble lineage was proclaimed by the
elevated longings of her pregnancy,) as the sky gives birth to the orb
of day. As soon as he was born, the lying-in chamber was illuminated by
his might, and so was made red as vermilion. And his father gave to
that infant, that brought terror to the families of his enemies, the
name of Vajraprabha, that had been appointed for him by a divine voice.
Then the boy grew by degrees, being filled with accomplishments, and
causing the exultation of his family, as the new moon fills out with
digits,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8084src" href="#xd27e8084" name=
"xd27e8084src">11</a> and causes the sea to rise.</p>
<p>Then, not long after, the queen of that king Hemaprabha again became
pregnant. And when she was pregnant, she sat upon a golden throne, and
became truly the jewel of the harem, adding special lustre to her
settings. And in a chariot, in the shape of a beautiful lotus,
manufactured by help of magic science, she roamed about in the sky,
since her pregnant longings assumed that form. But when the due time
came, a daughter was born to that queen, whose birth by the favour of
Gaur&iacute; was a sufficient guarantee of her loveliness. And this
voice was then heard from heaven&mdash;&ldquo;She shall be the wife of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rdquo;&mdash;which agreed with the words of
&#346;iva&rsquo;s revelation. And the king was just as much delighted
at her birth as he was at that of his son, and gave her the name of
Ratnaprabh&aacute;. And Ratnaprabh&aacute;, adorned with her own
science, grew up in the house of her father, producing illumination in
all the quarters of the sky. Then the king made his son Vajraprabha,
who had begun to wear armour, take a wife, and appointed him
crown-prince. And he devolved on him the burden of the kingdom and
remained at ease; but still one anxiety lingered in his heart, anxiety
about the marriage of his daughter.</p>
<p>One day the king beheld that daughter, who was fit to be given away
in marriage, sitting near him, and said to the queen
Alank&aacute;raprabh&aacute;, who was in his presence; &ldquo;Observe,
queen, a daughter is a great misery in the three worlds, even though
she is the ornament of her family, a misery, alas! even to the great.
For this Ratnaprabh&aacute;, though modest, learned, young and
beautiful, afflicts me because she has not obtained a husband.&rdquo;
The queen said to him&mdash;&ldquo;She was proclaimed by the gods as
the destined wife of Narav&aacute;hanadatta, our future emperor, why is
she not given to him?&rdquo; When the queen said this to him, the king
answered: &ldquo;In truth the maiden is fortunate, that shall obtain
him for a bridegroom. For he is an incarnation of K&aacute;ma upon
earth, but he has not as yet attained his divine nature: therefore I am
now waiting for his attainment of superhuman knowledge.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8093src" href="#xd27e8093" name=
"xd27e8093src">12</a> While he was thus speaking, Ratnaprabh&aacute;,
by means of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326"
name="pb326">326</a>]</span>accents of her father, which entered her
ear like the words of the bewildering spell of the god of love, became
as if bewildered, as if possessed, as if asleep, as if in a picture,
and her heart was captivated by that bridegroom. Then with difficulty
she took a respectful leave of her parents, and went to her own private
apartments, and managed at length to get to sleep at the end of the
night. Then the goddess Gaur&iacute;, being full of pity for her, gave
her this command in a dream; &ldquo;To-morrow, my daughter, is an
auspicious day; so thou must go to the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; and see thy future husband, and thence thy
father, O auspicious one, will himself bring thee and him into this his
city, and celebrate your marriage.&rdquo; So in the morning, when she
woke up, she told that dream to her mother. Then her mother gave her
leave to go, and she, knowing by her superhuman knowledge that her
bridegroom was in the garden, set out from her own city to visit
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest, O my husband, that I am that
Ratnaprabh&aacute;, arrived to-day in a moment, full of impatience, and
you all know the sequel.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of hers, that
in sweetness exceeded nectar, and beheld the body of the
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; that was ambrosia to the eyes,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta in his heart blamed the Creator, saying to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Why did he not make me all eye and ear?&rdquo; And
he said to her&mdash;&ldquo;Fortunate am I; my birth and life has
obtained its fruit, in that I, O beautiful one, have been thus visited
by thee out of affection!&rdquo; When they had thus exchanged the
protestations of new love, suddenly the army of the Vidy&aacute;dharas
was beheld there in the heaven. Ratnaprabh&aacute; said immediately,
&ldquo;Here is my father come,&rdquo; and the king Hemaprabha descended
from heaven with his son. And with his son Vajraprabha he approached
that Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who gave him a courteous welcome. And
while they stood for a moment paying one another the customary
compliments, the king of Vatsa, who had heard of it, came with his
ministers. And then that Hemaprabha told the king, after he had
performed towards him the rites of hospitality, the whole story exactly
as it had been related by Ratnaprabh&aacute;, and said, &ldquo;I knew
by the power of my supernatural knowledge that my daughter had come
here, and I am aware of all that has happened in this place.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8106src" href="#xd27e8106" name=
"xd27e8106src">13</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>For he will afterwards possess such an imperial chariot. Pray
consent, and then thou shalt behold in a short time thy son, the
prince, returned here, united to his wife Ratnaprabh&aacute;.&rdquo;
After he had addressed this prayer to the king of Vatsa, and he had
consented to his wish, that Hemaprabha, with his son, prepared that
chariot by his own magic skill, and made Narav&aacute;hanadatta ascend
it, together with Ratnaprabh&aacute;, whose face was cast down from
modesty, followed by Gomukha and the others, and <span class="corr"

who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>was also deputed to accompany him by his father,
and thus Hemaprabha took him to his own capital,
K&aacute;nchana&#347;ringaka.</p>
<p>And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, when he reached that city of his
father-in-law, saw that it was all of gold, gleaming with golden
ramparts, embraced, as it were, on all sides with rays issuing out like
shoots, and so stretching forth innumerable arms in eagerness of love
for that son-in-law. There the king Hemaprabha, of high emprise, gave
Ratnaprabh&aacute; with due ceremonies to him, as the sea gave
Lakshm&iacute; to Vish&#7751;u. And he gave him glittering heaps of
jewels, gleaming like innumerable wedding fires lighted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8120src" href="#xd27e8120" name=
"xd27e8120src">14</a> And in the city of that festive prince, who was
showering wealth, even the houses, being draped with flags, appeared as
if they had received changes of raiment. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
having performed the auspicious ceremony of marriage, remained there
enjoying heavenly pleasures with Ratnaprabh&aacute;. And he amused
himself by looking in her company at beautiful temples of the gods in
gardens and lakes, having ascended with her the heaven by the might of
her science.</p>
<p>So, after he had lived some days with his wife in the city of the
king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, the son of the king of Vatsa
determined, in accordance with the advice of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
to return to his own city. Then his mother-in-law performed for him the
auspicious ceremonies previous to starting, and his father-in-law again
honoured him and his minister, and then he set out with Hemaprabha and
his son, accompanied by his beloved, having again ascended that
chariot. He soon arrived, like a stream of nectar to the eyes of his
mother, and entered his city with Hemaprabha and his son and his own
followers, bringing with him his wife, who made the king of Vatsa
rejoice exceedingly with delight at beholding her. The king of Vatsa of
exalted fortune, with <span class="corr" id="xd27e8147" title=
"Source: Vasavadatt&aacute;">V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;</span>, welcomed
that son, who bowed at his feet with his wife, and honoured Hemaprabha
his new connexion, as well as his son, in a manner conformable to his
own dignity. Then, after that king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
Hemaprabha, had taken leave of the lord of Vatsa and his family, and
had flown up into the heaven and gone to his own city, that
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, together with Ratnaprabh&aacute; and
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, spent that day in happiness surrounded by his
friends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=

<p class="first">When that Narav&aacute;hanadatta had thus obtained a
new and lovely bride of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race, and was the next
day with her in her house, there came in the morning to the door, to
visit him, his ministers Gomukha and others. They were stopped for a
moment at the door by the female warder, and announced within; then
they entered and were courteously received, and Ratnaprabh&aacute; said
to the warder, &ldquo;The door must not again be closed against the
entrance of my husband&rsquo;s friends, for they are as dear to me as
my own body. And I do not think that this is the way to guard female
apartments.&rdquo; After she had addressed the female warder in these
words, she said in turn to her husband, &ldquo;My husband, I am going
to say something which occurs to me, so listen. I consider that the
strict seclusion of women is a mere social custom, or rather folly
produced by jealousy. It is of no use whatever. Women of good family
are guarded by their own virtue, as their only chamberlain. But even
God himself can scarcely guard the unchaste. Who can restrain a furious
river and a passionate woman? And now listen, I will tell you a
story.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Ratn&aacute;dhipati and the white
elephant &#346;vetara&#347;mi.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is here a great island in the midst of the sea,
named Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a. In it there lived in old times a king of
great courage, a devoted worshipper of Vish&#7751;u, rightly named
Ratn&aacute;dhipati.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8162src" href=
"#xd27e8162" name="xd27e8162src">1</a> That king, in order to obtain
the conquest of the earth, and all kings&rsquo; daughters as his wives,
went through a severe penance, to propitiate Vish&#7751;u. The adorable
one, pleased with his penance, appeared in bodily form, and thus
commanded him&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, king, I am pleased with thee, so I
tell thee this&mdash;listen! There is in the land of Kalinga a
Gandharva, who has become a white elephant by the curse of a hermit,
and is known by the name of &#346;vetara&#347;mi. On account of the
asceticism he performed in a former life, and on account of his
devotion to me, that elephant is supernaturally wise, and possesses the
power of flying through the sky, and of remembering his former birth.
And I have given an order to that great elephant, in accordance with
which he will come of himself through the air, and become thy beast of
burden. That white elephant thou must mount, as the wielder of the
thunderbolt mounts the elephant of the gods,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8167src" href="#xd27e8167" name="xd27e8167src">2</a> and whatever
king thou shalt travel through the air to visit, in fear shall bestow
on thee, who art of god-like presence, tribute in the form of a
daughter, for I will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"
name="pb329">329</a>]</span>myself command him to do so in a dream.
Thus thou shalt conquer the whole earth, and all <i>zenanas</i>, and
thou shalt obtain eighty thousand princesses.&rdquo; When Vish&#7751;u
had said this, he disappeared, and the king broke his fast, and the
next day he beheld that elephant, which had come to him through the
air. And when the elephant had thus placed himself at the king&rsquo;s
disposal, he mounted him, as he had been bidden to do by Vish&#7751;u,
and in this manner he conquered the earth, and carried off the
daughters of kings. And then the king dwelt there in
Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a with those wives, eighty thousand in number,
amusing himself as he pleased. And in order to propitiate
&#346;vetara&#347;mi, that celestial elephant, he fed every day five
hundred Br&aacute;hmans.</p>
<p>Now once on a time the king Ratn&aacute;dhipati mounted that
elephant, and, after roaming through the other islands, returned to his
own island. And as he was descending from the sky, it came to pass that
a bird of the race of Garu&#7693;a struck that excellent elephant with
his beak. And the bird fled, when the king struck him with the sharp
elephant-hook, but the elephant fell on the ground stunned by the blow
of the bird&rsquo;s beak. The king got off his back, but the elephant,
though he recovered his senses, was not able to rise up in spite of the
efforts made to raise him, and ceased eating. For five days the
elephant remained in the same place, where it had fallen, and the king
was grieved and took no food, and prayed as follows: &ldquo;Oh
guardians of the world, teach me some remedy in this difficulty;
otherwise I will cut off my own head and offer it to you.&rdquo; When
he had said this, he drew his sword and was preparing to cut off his
head, when immediately a bodiless voice thus addressed him from the
sky&mdash;&ldquo;O king do nothing rash; if some chaste woman touches
this elephant with her hand, it will rise up, but not otherwise.&rdquo;
When the king heard that, he was glad, and summoned his own carefully
guarded chief queen, Am&#7771;italat&aacute;. When the elephant did not
rise up, though she touched it with her hand, the king had all his
other wives summoned. But though they all touched the elephant in
succession, he did not rise up; the fact was, not one among them was
chaste. Then the king, having beheld all those eighty thousand wives
openly humiliated in the presence of men, being himself abashed,
summoned all the women of his capital, and made them touch the elephant
one after another. And when in spite of it the elephant did not rise
up, the king was ashamed, because there was not a single chaste woman
in his city.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile a merchant named Harshagupta, who had arrived
from T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8181src"
href="#xd27e8181" name="xd27e8181src">3</a> having heard of that event,
came there full of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330"
name="pb330">330</a>]</span>curiosity. And in his train there came a
servant of the name of &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, who was devoted to
her husband; when she saw what had taken place, she said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;I will touch this elephant with my hand: and if I have
not even thought in my mind of any other man than my husband, may it
rise up.&rdquo; No sooner had she said this, than she came up and
touched the elephant with her hand, whereupon it rose up in sound
health and began to eat.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8188src" href=
"#xd27e8188" name="xd27e8188src">4</a> But when the people saw the
elephant &#346;vetara&#347;mi rise up, they raised a shout and praised
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Such are these chaste
women, few and far between, who, like &#346;iva, are able to create,
preserve and destroy this world.&rdquo; The king Ratn&aacute;dhipati
also was pleased, and congratulated the chaste
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, and loaded her with innumerable jewels,
and he also honoured her master, the merchant Harshagupta, and gave him
a house near his own palace. And he determined to avoid all
communication with his own wives, and ordered that henceforth they
should have nothing but food and raiment.</p>
<p>Then the king, after he had taken his food, sent for the chaste
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, and said to her at a private interview in
the presence of Harshagupta, &ldquo;&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, if you
have any maiden of your father&rsquo;s family, give her to me, for I
know she will certainly be like you.&rdquo; When the king said this to
her, &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; answered&mdash;&ldquo;I have a sister
in T&aacute;mralipt&iacute; named R&aacute;jadatt&aacute;; marry her, O
king, if you wish, for she is of distinguished beauty.&rdquo; When she
said this to the king, he consented and said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo;
and having determined on taking this step, he mounted, with
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; and Harshagupta, the elephant
&#346;vetara&#347;mi, that could fly though the air, and going in
person to T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, entered the house of that merchant
Harshagupta. There he asked the astrologers that very day, what would
be a favourable time for him to be married to R&aacute;jadatt&aacute;,
the sister of &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;. And the astrologers, having
enquired under what stars both of them were born, said, &ldquo;A
favourable conjuncture will come for you, O king, in three months from
this time. But if you marry R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; in the present
position of the constellations, she will without fail prove
unchaste.&rdquo; Though the astrologers gave him this response, the
king, being eager for a charming wife, and impatient of dwelling long
alone, thus reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Away with scruples! I will marry
R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; here this very day. For she is the sister of
the blameless &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; and will never prove
unchaste. And I will place her in that uninhabited island in the middle
of the sea, where there is one empty palace, and in that inaccessible
spot I will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>surround her with a guard of women; so how can
she become unchaste, as she can never see men?&rdquo; Having formed
this determination, the king that very day rashly married that
R&aacute;jadatt&aacute;, whom &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; bestowed upon
him. And after he had married her, and had been received with the
customary rites by Harshagupta, he took that wife, and with her and
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, he mounted &#346;vetara&#347;mi, and then
in a moment went through the air to the land of Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a,
where the people were anxiously expecting him. And he rewarded
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; again so munificently, that she attained
all her wishes, having reaped the fruit of her vow of chastity. Then he
mounted his new wife R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; on that same
air-travelling elephant &#346;vetara&#347;mi, and conveyed her
carefully, and placed her in the empty palace in the island in the
midst of the sea, inaccessible to man, with a retinue of women only.
And whatever article she required, he conveyed there through the air on
that elephant, so great was his distrust. And being devotedly attached
to her, he always spent the night there, but came to
Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a in the day to transact his regal duties. Now one
morning the king, in order to counteract an inauspicious dream,
indulged with that R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; in a drinking-bout for good
luck. And though his wife, being intoxicated with that banquet, did not
wish to let him go, he left her, and departed to Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a
to transact his business, for the royal dignity is an ever-exacting
wife. There he remained performing his duties with anxious mind, which
seemed ever to ask him, why he left his wife there in a state of
intoxication? And in the meanwhile R&aacute;jadatt&aacute;, remaining
alone in that inaccessible place, the female servants being occupied in
culinary and other duties, saw a certain man come in at the door, like
Fate determined to baffle all expedients for guarding her, and his
arrival filled her with astonishment. And that intoxicated woman asked
him when he approached her, &ldquo;Who are you, and how have you come
to this inaccessible place?&rdquo; Then that man, who had endured many
hardships, answered her&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Yavanasena.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fair one, I am a merchant&rsquo;s son of
Mathur&aacute; named Yavanasena. And when my father died, I was left
helpless, and my relations took from me my property, so I went to a
foreign country, and resorted to the miserable condition of being
servant to another man. Then I with difficulty scraped together a
little wealth by trading, and as I was going to another land, I was
plundered by robbers who met me on the way. Then I wandered about as a
beggar, and, with some other men like myself, I went to a mine of
jewels called Kanakakshetra. There I engaged to pay the king his share,
and after digging up the earth in a trench for a whole year, I did not
find a single jewel. So, while the other men my fellows were rejoicing
over the jewels they had found, smitten with grief I retired to the
shore of the sea, and began to collect fuel. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>And while I was constructing with the fuel a funeral pyre, in order
that I might enter the flame, a certain merchant named J&iacute;vadatta
happened to come there; that merciful man dissuaded me from suicide,
and gave me food, and as he was preparing to go in a ship to
Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa he took me on board with him. Then, as we were
sailing along in the midst of the ocean, after five days had passed, we
suddenly beheld a cloud. The cloud discharged its rain in large drops,
and that vessel was whirled round by the wind like the head of a
<i>mast</i> elephant. Immediately the ship sank, but as fate would have
it, I caught hold of a plank, just as I was sinking. I mounted on it,
and thereupon the thunder-cloud relaxed its fury, and, conducted by
destiny, I reached this country; and have just landed in the forest.
And seeing this palace, I entered, and I beheld here thee, O auspicious
one, a rain of nectar to my eyes, dispelling pain.</p>
<p>When he had said this, R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; maddened with love
and wine, placed him on a couch and embraced him. Where there are these
five fires, feminine nature, intoxication, privacy, the obtaining of a
man, and absence of restraint, what chance for the stubble of
character? So true is it, that a woman maddened by the god of Love is
incapable of discrimination; since this queen became enamoured of that
loathsome castaway. In the meanwhile the king Ratn&aacute;dhipati,
being anxious, came swiftly from Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a, borne along on
the sky-going elephant; and entering his palace he beheld his wife
R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; in the arms of that creature. When the king saw
the man, though he felt tempted to slay him, he slew him not, because
he fell at his feet, and uttered piteous supplications. And beholding
his wife terrified, and at the same time intoxicated, he reflected,
&ldquo;How can a woman that is addicted to wine, the chief ally of
lust, be chaste? A lascivious woman cannot be restrained even by being
guarded. Can one fetter a whirlwind with one&rsquo;s arms? This is the
fruit of my not heeding the prediction of the astrologers. To whom is
not the scorning of wise words bitter in its after-taste? When I
thought that she was the sister of &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, I
forgot that the K&aacute;lak&uacute;&#7789;a poison was twin-born with
the <i>am&#7771;ita</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8211src" href=
"#xd27e8211" name="xd27e8211src">5</a> Or rather who is able, even by
doing the utmost of a man, to overcome the incalculable freaks of
marvellously working Destiny.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the king was not
wroth with any one, and spared the merchant&rsquo;s son, her paramour,
after asking him the story of his life. The merchant&rsquo;s son, when
dismissed thence, seeing no other expedient, went out and beheld a ship
coming, far off in the sea. Then he again mounted that plank, and
drifting about in the sea, cried out, puffing and blowing, &ldquo;Save
me! Save me!&rdquo; So a merchant, of the name of Krodhavarman, who was
on that ship, drew that merchant&rsquo;s son out of the water, and made
him his companion. Whatever deed is appointed by the Disposer to be the
destruction of any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333"
name="pb333">333</a>]</span>man, dogs his steps whithersoever he
runneth. For this fool, when on the ship, was discovered by his
deliverer secretly associating with his wife, and thereupon was cast by
him into the sea and perished.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king Ratn&aacute;dhipati caused the queen
R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; with her retinue to mount &#346;vetara&#347;mi,
without allowing himself to be angry, and he carried her to
Ratnak&uacute;&#7789;a, and delivered her to
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, and related that occurrence to her and his
ministers. And he exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas! How much pain have I endured,
whose mind has been devoted to these unsubstantial insipid enjoyments.
Therefore I will go to the forest, and take Hari as my refuge, in order
that I may never again be a vessel of such woes.&rdquo; Thus he spake,
and though his sorrowing ministers and &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;
endeavoured to prevent him, he, being disgusted with the world, would
not abandon his intention. Then, being indifferent to enjoyments, he
first gave half of his treasure to the virtuous
&#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute;, and the other half to the Br&aacute;hmans,
and then that king made over in the prescribed form his kingdom to a
Br&aacute;hman of great excellence, named P&aacute;pabhanjana. And
after he had given away his kingdom, he ordered &#346;vetara&#347;mi to
be brought, with the object of retiring to a grove of asceticism, his
subjects looking on with tearful eyes. No sooner was the elephant
brought, than it left the body, and became a man of god-like
appearance, adorned with necklace and bracelet. When the king asked him
who he was, and what was the meaning of all this, he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were two Gandharva brothers, living on the Malaya
mountain: I was called Somaprabha, and the eldest was Devaprabha. And
my brother had but one wife, but she was very dear to him. Her name was
R&aacute;javat&iacute;. One day he was wandering about with her in his
arms, and happened to arrive, with me in his company, at a place called
the dwelling of the Siddhas. There we both worshipped Vish&#7751;u in
his temple, and began all of us to sing before the adorable one. In the
meanwhile a Siddha came there, and stood regarding with fixed gaze
R&aacute;javat&iacute;, who was singing songs well worth hearing. And
my brother, who was jealous, said in his wrath to that Siddha;
&lsquo;Why dost thou, although a Siddha, cast a longing look at
another&rsquo;s wife?&rsquo; Then the Siddha was moved with anger, and
said to him by way of a curse&mdash;&lsquo;Fool, I was looking at her
out of interest in her song, not out of desire. So fall thou, jealous
one, into a mortal womb together with her; and then behold with thy own
eyes thy wife in the embraces of another.&rsquo; When he had said this,
I, being enraged at the curse, struck him, out of childish
recklessness, with a white toy elephant of clay, that I had in my hand.
Then he cursed me in the following words&mdash;&ldquo;Be born again on
the earth as an elephant, like that with which you have just struck
me.&rdquo; Then being merciful, that Siddha allowed himself to be
propitiated by that brother of mine Devaprabha, and appointed for us
both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>the following termination of the curse;
&ldquo;Though a mortal thou shalt become, by the favour of
Vish&#7751;u, the lord of an island, and shalt obtain as thy servant
this thy younger brother, who will have become an elephant, a beast of
burden fit for gods. Thou shalt obtain eighty thousand wives, and thou
shalt come to learn the unchastity of them all in the presence of men.
Then thou shalt marry this thy present wife, who will have become a
woman, and shalt see her with thy own eyes embracing another. Then,
thou shalt become sick in thy heart of the world, and shalt bestow thy
realm on a Br&aacute;hman, but when after doing this thou shalt set out
to go to a forest of ascetics, thy younger brother shall first be
released from his elephant nature, and thou also with thy wife shalt be
delivered from thy curse.&rsquo; This was the termination of the curse
appointed for us by the Siddha, and we were accordingly born with
different lots, on account of the difference of our actions in that
previous state, and lo! the end of our curse has now arrived.&rdquo;
When Somaprabha had said this, that king Ratn&aacute;dhipati remembered
his former birth, and said&mdash;&ldquo;True! I am that very
Devaprabha; and this R&aacute;jadatt&aacute; is my former wife
R&aacute;javat&iacute;.&rdquo; Having said this, he, together with his
wife, abandoned the body. In a moment they all became Gandharvas, and,
in the sight of men, flew up into the air, and went to their own home,
the Malaya mountain. &#346;&iacute;lavat&iacute; too, through the
nobleness of her character, obtained prosperity, and going to the city
of T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, remained in the practice of virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So true is it, that in no case can any one guard a woman by
force in this world, but the young woman of good family is ever
protected by the pure restraint of her own chastity. And thus the
passion of jealousy is merely a purposeless cause of suffering,
annoying others, and so far from being a protection to women, it rather
excites in them excessive longing.&rdquo; When Narav&aacute;hanadatta
had heard this tale full of good sense related by his wife, he and his
ministers were highly pleased.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Ni&#347;chayadatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this land a town of the name of
Ujjayin&iacute;, famous throughout the world: in it there lived of old
time a merchant&rsquo;s son, named <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335"
href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>Ni&#347;chayadatta. He was a
gambler and had acquired money by gambling, and every day the generous
man used to bathe in the water of the Sipr&aacute;, and worship
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8236src" href=
"#xd27e8236" name="xd27e8236src">1</a> his custom was first to give
money to the Br&aacute;hmans, the poor, and the helpless, and then to
anoint himself and indulge in food and betel.</p>
<p>Every day, when he had finished his bathing and his worship, he used
to go and anoint himself in a cemetery near the temple of
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, with sandalwood and other things. And the young
man placed the unguent on a stone pillar that stood there, and so
anointed himself every day alone, rubbing his back against it. In that
way the pillar eventually became very smooth and polished. Then there
came that way a draughtsman with a sculptor; the first, seeing that the
pillar was very smooth, drew on it a figure of Gaur&iacute;, and the
sculptor with his chisel in pure sport carved it on the stone. Then,
after they had departed, a certain daughter of the Vidy&aacute;dharas
came there to worship Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, and saw that image of
Gaur&iacute; on the stone. From the clearness of the image she inferred
the proximity of the goddess, and, after worshipping, she entered that
stone pillar to rest. In the meanwhile Ni&#347;chayadatta, the
merchant&rsquo;s son, came there, and to his astonishment beheld that
figure of Um&aacute; carved on the stone. He first anointed his limbs,
and then placing the unguent on another part of the stone, began to
anoint his back by rubbing it against the stone. When the rolling-eyed
Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden inside the pillar saw that, her heart being
captivated by his beauty, she reflected&mdash;&ldquo;What! has this
handsome man no one to anoint his back? Then I will now rub his back
for him.&rdquo; Thus the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; reflected, and,
stretching forth her hand from inside the pillar, she anointed his back
then and there out of affection. Immediately the merchant&rsquo;s son
felt the touch, and heard the jingling of the bracelet, and caught hold
of her hand with his. And the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, invisible as
she was, said to him from the pillar&mdash;&ldquo;Noble sir, what harm
have I done you? let go my hand.&rdquo; Then Ni&#347;chayadatta
answered her&mdash;&ldquo;Appear before me, and say who you are, then I
will let go your hand.&rdquo; Then the Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;
affirmed with an oath&mdash;&ldquo;I will appear before your eyes, and
tell you all.&rdquo; So he let go her hand. Then she came out visibly
from the pillar, beautiful in every limb, and sitting down, with her
eyes fixed on his face, said to him, &ldquo;There is a city called
Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8241src" href=
"#xd27e8241" name="xd27e8241src">2</a> on a peak of the
Him&aacute;layas, in it there lives a king named Vindhyapara. I am his
maiden daughter, named Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;. I came to worship
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, and rested here to-day. And thereupon you came
here, and were beheld by me anointing your back on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>this
pillar, resembling the stupefying weapon of the god of love. Then first
my heart was charmed with affection for you, and afterwards my hand was
smeared with your unguent, as I rubbed your back.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8246src" href="#xd27e8246" name="xd27e8246src">3</a> The sequel
you know. So I will now go to my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this to the merchant&rsquo;s son, he
answered&mdash;&ldquo;Fair one, I have not recovered my soul which you
have taken captive; how can you thus depart, without letting go the
soul which you have taken possession of?&rdquo; When he said this to
her, she was immediately overcome with love, and said&mdash;&ldquo;I
will marry you, if you come to my city. It is not hard for you to
reach; your endeavour will be sure to succeed. For nothing in this
world is difficult to the enterprising.&rdquo; Having said this,
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; flew up into the air and departed; and
Ni&#347;chayadatta returned home with mind fixed upon her. Recollecting
the hand that was protruded from the pillar, like a shoot from the
trunk of a tree, he thought&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! though I seized her hand
I did not win it for my own. Therefore I will go to the city of
Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute; to visit her, and either I shall lose my
life, or Fate will come to my aid.&rdquo; So musing, he passed that day
there in an agony of love, and he set out from that place early the
next morning, making for the north. As he journeyed, three other
merchants&rsquo; sons, who were travelling towards the north,
associated themselves with him as companions. In company with them he
travelled through cities, villages, forests, and rivers, and at last
reached the northern region abounding in barbarians.</p>
<p>There he and his companions were found on the way by some
T&aacute;jikas, who took them and sold them to another T&aacute;jika.
He sent them in the care of his servants as a present to a Turushka,
named Murav&aacute;ra. Then those servants took him and the other
three, and hearing that Murav&aacute;ra was dead, they delivered them
to his son. The son of Murav&aacute;ra thought&mdash;&ldquo;These men
have been sent me as a present by my father&rsquo;s friend, so I must
send them to him to-morrow by throwing them into his
grave.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8262src" href="#xd27e8262"
name="xd27e8262src">4</a> Accordingly the <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8270" title="Source: Turuskha">Turushka</span> fettered
Ni&#347;chayadatta and his three friends with strong chains, that they
might be kept till the morning. Then, while they were remaining in
chains at night, Ni&#347;chayadatta said to his three friends, the
merchant&rsquo;s sons, who were afflicted with dread of
death&mdash;&ldquo;What will you gain by despondency? Maintain
steadfast resolution. For calamities depart far away from the resolute,
as if terrified at them. Think on the peerless adorable Durg&aacute;,
that deliverer from calamity.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus encouraging them, he devoutly worshipped that goddess
Durg&aacute;: &ldquo;Hail to thee, O goddess! I worship thy feet that
are stained with a red dye, as if it were the clotted gore of the
trampled Asura clinging to them. Thou, as the all-ruling power of
&#346;iva, dost govern the three worlds, and inspired by thee they live
and move. Thou didst deliver the worlds, O slayer of the Asura Mahisha.
Deliver me that crave thy protection, O thou cherisher of thy
votaries.&rdquo; In these and similar words he and his companions duly
worshipped the goddess, and then they all fell asleep, being weary. And
the goddess Durg&aacute; in a dream commanded Ni&#347;chayadatta and
his companions&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, my children, depart, for your
fetters are loosed.&rdquo; Then they woke up at night, and saw that
their fetters had fallen off of themselves, and after relating to one
another their dream, they departed thence delighted. And after they had
gone a long journey, the night came to an end, and then those
merchant&rsquo;s sons, who had gone through such terrors, said to
Ni&#347;chayadatta; &ldquo;Enough of this quarter of the world infested
with barbarians! We will go to the Deccan, friend, but do you do as you
desire.&rdquo;&mdash;When they said this to him, he dismissed them to
go where they would, and set out alone vigorously on his journey,
making towards that very northern quarter, drawn by the noose of love
for Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, flinging aside fear. As he went along,
he fell in, in course of time, with four P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetics,
and reached and crossed the river Vitast&aacute;. And after crossing
it, he took food, and as the sun was kissing the western mountain, he
entered with them a forest that lay in their path. And there some
woodmen, that met them, said to them: &ldquo;Whither are you going, now
that the day is over. There is no village in front of you: but there is
an empty temple of &#346;iva in this wood. Whoever remains there during
the night inside or outside, falls a prey to a Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;,
who bewilders him, making horns grow on his forehead, and then treats
him as a victim, and devours him.&rdquo; Those four
P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetics, who were travelling together, though
they heard this, said to Ni&#347;chayadatta, &ldquo;Come along! what
can that miserable Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; do to us? For we have remained
many nights in various cemeteries.&rdquo; When they said this, he went
with them, and finding an empty temple of &#346;iva, he entered it with
them to pass the night there. In the court of that temple the bold
Ni&#347;chayadatta and the P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetics quickly made a
great circle with ashes, and entering into it, they lighted a fire with
fuel, and all remained there, muttering a charm to protect
themselves.</p>
<p>Then at night there came there dancing the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;
<span class="corr" id="xd27e8278" title=

id="xd27e8281src" href="#xd27e8281" name="xd27e8281src">5</a> playing
from afar on her lute of bones, and when she came near, she fixed her
eye on one of the four P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetics, and recited a
charm, as she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>danced outside the circle. That charm produced
horns on him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8288src" href="#xd27e8288"
name="xd27e8288src">6</a> and bewildered he rose up, and danced till he
fell into the blazing fire. And when he had fallen, the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; dragged him half-burnt out of the fire, and
devoured him with delight. Then she fixed her eye on the second
P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic, and in the same way recited the
horn-producing charm and danced. The second one also had horns produced
by that charm, and was made to dance, and falling into the fire, was
dragged out and devoured before the eyes of the others. In this way the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; maddened one after another at night the four
ascetics, and after horns had been produced on them, devoured them. But
while she was devouring the fourth, it came to pass that, being
intoxicated with flesh and blood, she laid her lute down on the ground.
Thereupon the bold Ni&#347;chayadatta rose up quickly, and seized the
lute, and began to play on it, and dancing round with a laugh, to
recite that horn-producing charm, which he had learnt from hearing it
often, fixing at the same time his eye on the face of the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;. By the operation of the charm she was confused,
and dreading death, as horns were just about to sprout on her forehead,
she flung herself prostrate, and thus entreated him; &ldquo;Valiant
man, do not slay me, a helpless woman. I now implore your protection,
stop the recital of the charm, and the accompanying movements. Spare
me! I know all your story, and will bring about your wish; I will carry
you to the place, where Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; is.&rdquo; The bold
Ni&#347;chayadatta, when thus confidingly addressed by her, consented,
and stopped the recital of the charm, and the accompanying movements.
Then, at the request of the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, he mounted on her
back, and being carried by her through the air, he went to find his
beloved.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8331src" href="#xd27e8331" name=
"xd27e8331src">7</a></p>
<p>And when the night came to an end, they had reached a mountain wood;
there the Guhyak&iacute; bowing thus addressed Ni&#347;chayadatta;
&ldquo;Now that the sun has risen, I have no power to go
upwards,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8339src" href="#xd27e8339" name=
"xd27e8339src">8</a> so spend this day in this charming wood, my lord;
eat sweet fruits and drink the clear water of the brooks. I go to my
own place, and I will return at the approach of night; and then I will
take you to the city of Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute;, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>the
crown of the Him&aacute;layas, and into the presence of
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;.&rdquo; Having said this, the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; with his permission set him down from her
shoulder, and departed to return again according to her promise.</p>
<p>When she had gone, Ni&#347;chayadatta beheld a deep lake,
transparent and cool, but tainted with poison, lit up by the sun, that
stretching forth the fingers of its rays, revealed it as an example
illustrative of the nature of the heart of a passionate woman. He knew
by the smell that it was tainted with poison, and left it, after
necessary ablutions, and being afflicted with thirst he roamed all over
that heavenly mountain in search of water. And as he was wandering
about, he saw on a lofty place what seemed to be two rubies glittering,
and he dug up the ground there.</p>
<p>And after he had removed the earth, he saw there the head of a
living monkey, and his eyes like two rubies. While he was indulging his
wonder, thinking what this could be, that monkey thus addressed him
with human voice; &ldquo;I am a man, a Br&aacute;hman transformed into
a monkey<span class="corr" id="xd27e8348" title="Source: ,">;</span>
release me, and then I will tell you all my story, excellent
sir.&rdquo; As soon as he heard this, he removed the earth, marvelling,
and drew the ape out of the ground. When Ni&#347;chayadatta had drawn
out the ape, it fell at his feet, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;You have
given me life by rescuing me from calamity. So come, since you are
weary, take fruit and water, and by your favour I also will break my
long fast. Having said this, the liberated monkey took him to the bank
of a mountain-torrent some distance off, where there were delicious
fruits, and shady trees. There he bathed and took fruit and water, and
coming back, he said to the monkey who had broken his
fast&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me how you have become a monkey, being really a
man.&rdquo; Then that monkey said, &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you
now.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Somasv&aacute;min.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of <span class="corr" id="xd27e8356"
title="Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>
there is an excellent Br&aacute;hman named Chandrasv&aacute;min, I am
his son by his virtuous wife, my friend. And my father gave me the name
of Somasv&aacute;min. In course of time it came to pass that I mounted
the fierce elephant of love, which infatuation makes uncontrollable.
When I was at this stage of my life, the youthful Bandhudatt&aacute;,
the daughter of the merchant &#346;r&iacute;garbha, an inhabitant of
that city, and the wife of the great merchant of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8359" title="Source: Mathura">Mathur&aacute;</span>
Var&aacute;hadatta, who was dwelling in her father&rsquo;s house,
beheld me one day, as she was looking out of the window. She was
enamoured of me on beholding me, and after enquiring my name, she sent
a confidential female friend to me, desiring an interview<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e8362" title="Source: ,">.</span> Her friend came up
secretly to me who was blind with love, and, after telling her
friend&rsquo;s desire, took me to her house. There she placed me, and
then went and brought secretly Bandhudatt&aacute;, whose eagerness made
her disregard shame. And no sooner was she brought, than she threw her
arms round my neck, for excessive love in women is your only hero for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>daring. Thus every day Bandhudatt&aacute; came
at will from her father&rsquo;s house, and sported with me in the house
of her female friend.</p>
<p>Now one day the great merchant, her husband, came from
Mathur&aacute; to take her back to his own house, as she had been long
absent. Then Bandhudatt&aacute;, as her father ordered her to go, and
her husband was eager to take her away, secretly made a second request
to her friend. She said &ldquo;I am certainly going to be taken by my
husband to the city of Mathur&aacute;, and I cannot live there
separated from Somasv&aacute;min. So tell me what resource there is
left to me in this matter.&rdquo; When she said this, her friend
Sukha&#347;ay&aacute;, who was a witch, answered her, &ldquo;I know two
spells;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8369src" href="#xd27e8369" name=
"xd27e8369src">9</a> by reciting one of them a man can be in a moment
made an ape, if a string is fastened round his neck, and by the second,
if the string is loosed, he will immediately become a man again; and
while he is an ape his intelligence is not diminished. So if you like,
fair one, you can keep your lover Somasv&aacute;min; for I will turn
him into an ape on the spot, then take him with you to Mathur&aacute;
as a pet animal. And I will shew you how to use the two spells, so that
you can turn him, when near you, into the shape of a monkey, and when
you are in a secret place, make him once more a beloved man.&rdquo;
When her friend had told her this, Bandhudatt&aacute; consented, and
sending for me in secret, told me that matter in the most loving tone.
I consented, and immediately Sukha&#347;ay&aacute; fastened a thread on
my neck and recited the spell, and made me a young monkey. And in that
shape Bandhudatt&aacute; brought and shewed me to her husband, and she
said&mdash;&ldquo;A friend of mine gave me this animal to play
with.&rdquo; And he was delighted when he saw me in her arms as a
plaything, and I, though a monkey, retained my intelligence, and the
power of articulate speech. And I remained there, saying to myself with
inward laughter&mdash;&ldquo;Wonderful are the actions of women.&rdquo;
For whom does not love beguile? The next day Bandhudatt&aacute;, having
been taught that spell by her friend, set out from her father&rsquo;s
house to go to Mathur&aacute; with her husband. And the husband of
Bandhudatt&aacute;, wishing to please her, had me carried on the back
of one of his servants during the journey. So the servant and I and the
rest went along, and in two or three days reached a wood, that lay in
our way, which was perilous from abounding in monkeys. Then the
monkeys, beholding me, attacked me in troops on all sides, quickly
calling to one another with shrill cries. And the irrepressible apes
came and began to bite that merchant&rsquo;s servant, on whose back I
was sitting. He was terrified at that, and flung me off his back on to
the ground, and fled for fear, so the monkeys got hold of me then and
there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>And Bandhudatt&aacute;, out of love for me, and
her husband and his servants, attacked the apes with stones and sticks,
but were not able to get the better of them. Then those monkeys, as if
enraged with my evil actions, pulled off with their teeth and nails
every hair from every one of my limbs, as I lay there bewildered. At
last, by the virtue of the string on my neck, and by thinking on
&#346;iva, I managed to recover my strength, and getting loose from
them, I ran away. And entering into the depths of the wood, I got out
of their sight, and gradually, roaming from forest to forest, I reached
this wood. And while I was wandering about here in the rainy season,
blind with the darkness of grief, saying to myself, &ldquo;How is it
that even in this life adultery has produced for thee the fruit of
transformation into the shape of a monkey, and thou hast lost
Bandhudatt&aacute;?&rdquo; Destiny, not yet sated with tormenting me,
inflicted on me another woe, for a female elephant suddenly came upon
me, and seizing me with her trunk flung me into the mud of an ant-hill
that had been saturated with rain. I know it must have been some
divinity instigated by Destiny, for, though I exerted myself to the
utmost, I could not get out of that mud. And while it was drying
up,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8391src" href="#xd27e8391" name=
"xd27e8391src">10</a> not only did I not die, but knowledge was
produced in me, while I thought continually upon &#346;iva. And all the
while I never felt hunger nor thirst, my friend, until to-day you drew
me out of this trap of dry mud. And though I have gained knowledge, I
do not even now possess power sufficient to set myself free from this
monkey nature. But when some witch unties the thread on my neck,
reciting at the same time the appropriate spell, then I shall once more
become a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my story, but tell me now, my friend, how you came to
this inaccessible wood, and why.&rdquo; When Ni&#347;chayadatta was
thus requested by the Br&aacute;hman Somasv&aacute;min, he told him his
story, how he came from Ujjayin&iacute; on account of a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, and how he was conveyed at night by a
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, whom he had subdued by his presence of mind.
Then the wise Somasv&aacute;min, who wore the form of a monkey, having
heard that wonderful story, went on to say; &ldquo;You, like myself,
have suffered great woe for the sake of a female. But females, like
prosperous circumstances, are never faithful to any one in this world.
Like the evening, they display a short-lived glow of passion, their
hearts are crooked like the channels of rivers, like snakes they are
not to be relied on, like lightning they are fickle. So, that
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, though she may be enamoured of you for a
time, when she finds a paramour of her own race, will be disgusted with
you, who are only a mortal. So desist now from this effort for the sake
of a female, which you will find like the fruit of the Colocynth,
bitter in its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>after-taste. Do not go, my friend, to
Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute;, the city of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, but
ascend the back of the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; and return to your own
Ujjayin&iacute;. Do what I tell you, my friend; formerly in my passion
I did not heed the voice of a friend, and I am suffering for it at this
very moment. For when I was in love with Bandhudatt&aacute;, a
Br&aacute;hman named Bhava&#347;arman, who was a very dear friend of
mine, said this to me in order to dissuade me;&mdash;&lsquo;Do not put
yourself in the power of a female, the heart of a female is a tangled
maze; in proof of it I will tell you what happened to
me&mdash;listen!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this very country, in the city of <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e8409" title=
"Source: V&aacute;r&aacute;nas&iacute;">V&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;</span>,
there lived a young and beautiful Br&aacute;hman woman named
Somad&aacute;, who was unchaste and secretly a witch. And as destiny
would have it, I had secret interviews with her, and in the course of
our intimacy my love for her increased. One day I wilfully struck her
in the fury of jealousy, and the cruel woman bore it patiently,
concealing her anger for the time. The next day she fastened a string
round my neck, as if in loving sport, and I was immediately turned into
a domesticated ox. Then I, thus transformed into an ox, was sold by
her, on receiving the required price, to a man who lived by keeping
domesticated camels. When he placed a load upon me, a witch there,
named Bandhamochanik&aacute;, beholding me sore burdened, was filled
with pity.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8412src" href="#xd27e8412" name=
"xd27e8412src">11</a> She knew by her supernatural knowledge that I had
been made an animal by Somad&aacute;, and when my proprietor was not
looking, she loosed the string from my neck. So I returned to the form
of a man, and that master of mine immediately looked round, and
thinking that I had escaped, wandered all about the country in search
of me. And as I was going away from that place with
Bandhamochin&iacute;, it happened that Somad&aacute; came that way and
beheld me at a distance. She, burning with rage, said to
Bandhamochin&iacute;, who possessed supernatural
knowledge,&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you deliver this villain from his
bestial transformation? Curses on you! wicked woman, you shall reap the
fruit of this evil deed. To-morrow morning I will slay you, together
with this villain.&rdquo; When she had gone after saying this, that
skilful sorceress Bandhamochin&iacute;, in order to repel her assault,
gave me the following instructions&mdash;&ldquo;She will come to-morrow
morning in the form of a black mare to slay me, and I shall then assume
the form of a bay mare. And when we have begun to fight, you must come
behind this Somad&aacute;, sword in hand, and resolutely strike her. In
this way we will slay her; so come to-morrow morning to my
house.&rdquo; After saying this, she pointed out to me her house. When
she had entered it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343"
name="pb343">343</a>]</span>I went home, having endured more than one
birth in this very life. And in the morning I went to the house of
Bandhamochin&iacute;, sword in hand. Then Somad&aacute; came there, in
the form of a black mare.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8417src" href=
"#xd27e8417" name="xd27e8417src">12</a> And Bandhamochin&iacute;, for
her part, assumed the form of a bay mare; and then they fought with
their teeth and heels, biting and kicking. Then I struck that vile
witch Somad&aacute; a blow with my sword, and she was slain by
Bandhamochin&iacute;. Then I was freed from fear, and having escaped
the calamity of bestial transformation, I never again allowed my mind
to entertain the idea of associating with wicked women. Women generally
have these three faults, terrible to the three worlds, flightiness,
recklessness, and a love for the congregation of witches.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8422src" href="#xd27e8422" name=
"xd27e8422src">13</a> So why do you run after Bandhudatt&aacute;, who
is a friend of witches? Since she does not love her husband, how is it
possible that she can love you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though my friend Bhava&#347;arman gave me this advice, I did
not do what he told me; and so I am reduced to this state. So I give
you this counsel; do not suffer hardship to win
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, for when she obtains a lover of her own
race, she will of a surety desert you. A woman ever desires fresh men,
as a female humble bee wanders from flower to flower; so you will
suffer regret some day, like me, my friend.&rdquo; This speech of
Somasv&aacute;min, who had been transformed into a monkey, did not
penetrate the heart of Ni&#347;chayadatta, for it was full of passion.
And he said to that monkey; &ldquo;She will not be unfaithful to me,
for she is born of the pure race of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo;
Whilst they were thus conversing, the sun, red with the hues of
evening, went to the mountain of setting, as if wishing to please
Ni&#347;chayadatta. Then the night arrived, as the harbinger of the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; &#346;&#7771;ingotp&aacute;din&iacute;, and she
herself came soon afterwards. And Ni&#347;chayadatta mounted on her
back, and went off to go to his beloved, taking leave of the ape, who
begged that he might ever be remembered by him. And at midnight he
reached that city of Pushkar&aacute;vat&iacute;, which was situated on
the Him&aacute;layas, and belonged to the king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, the father of Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;. At that
very moment Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, having known by her power of his
arrival, came out from that city to meet him. Then the
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; put down Ni&#347;chayadatta from her shoulder,
and pointing out to him Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;,
said&mdash;&ldquo;Here comes your beloved, like a second moon giving a
feast to your eyes in the night, so now I will depart,&rdquo; and
bowing before him, she went her way. Then Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;,
full of the excitement produced by expectation, went up to her beloved,
and welcomed him with embraces and other signs of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>love. He too embraced her, and now that he had
obtained the joy of meeting her after enduring many hardships, he could
not be contained in his own body, and as it were entered hers. So
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; was made his wife by the G&aacute;ndharva
ceremony of marriage, and she immediately by her magic skill created a
city. In that city, which was outside the metropolis, he dwelt with
her, without her parents suspecting it, as their eyes were blinded by
her skill. And when, on her questioning him, he told her those strange
and painful adventures of his journey, she respected him much, and
bestowed on him all the enjoyments that heart could wish.</p>
<p>Then Ni&#347;chayadatta told that Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; the
strange story of Somasv&aacute;min, who had been transformed into a
monkey, and said to her, &ldquo;If this friend of mine could by any
endeavour on your part be freed from his monkey condition, then my
beloved, you would have done a good deed.&rdquo; When he told her this,
Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; said to him&mdash;&ldquo;This is in the way
of witches&rsquo; spells, but it is not our province. Nevertheless I
will accomplish this desire of yours, by asking a friend of mine, a
skilful witch named Bhadrar&uacute;p&aacute;. When the merchant&rsquo;s
son heard that, he was delighted, and said to that beloved of
his&mdash;&ldquo;So come and see my friend, let us go to visit
him.&rdquo; She consented, and the next day, carried in her lap,
Ni&#347;chayadatta went through the air to the wood, which was the
residence of his friend. When he saw his friend there in monkey form,
he went up to him with his wife, who bowed before him, and asked after
his welfare. And the monkey Somasv&aacute;min welcomed him,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;It is well with me to-day, in that I have beheld
you united to Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;,&rdquo; and he gave his
blessing to Ni&#347;chayadatta&rsquo;s wife. Then all three sat down on
a charming slab of rock there, and held a conversation<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8436src" href="#xd27e8436" name=
"xd27e8436src">14</a> about his story, the various adventures of that
ape, previously discussed by Ni&#347;chayadatta with his beloved. Then
Ni&#347;chayadatta took leave of that monkey, and went to the house of
his beloved, flying up into the air, carried by her in her arms.</p>
<p>And the next day he again said to that Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;,
&ldquo;Come, let us go for a moment to visit that ape our
friend;&rdquo; then she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Go to-day yourself,
receive from me the science of flying up, and also that of
descending.&rdquo; When she had said this to him, he took those two
sciences, and flew through the air to his friend the ape. And as he
remained long conversing with him, Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; went out
of the house into the garden. While she was seated there, a certain
Vidy&aacute;dhara youth, who was wandering at will through the air,
came there. The Vidy&aacute;dhara, knowing by his art that she was a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; who had a mortal husband, the moment he beheld
her, was overpowered with a paroxysm of love, and approached her. And
she, with face bent on the ground, beheld that he was handsome and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>attractive, and slowly asked him out of
curiosity, who he was and whence he came. Then he answered her,
&ldquo;Know, fair one, that I am a Vidy&aacute;dhara, by name
R&aacute;gabhanjana, distinguished for my knowledge of the sciences of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas. The moment I beheld you, O gazelle-eyed one, I
was suddenly overpowered by love, and made your slave, so cease to
honour, O goddess, a mortal, whose abode is the earth, and favour me,
your equal, before your father finds out your intrigue.&rdquo; When he
said this, the fickle-hearted one, looking timidly at him with a
sidelong glance, thought&mdash;&ldquo;Here is a fit match for
me.&rdquo; When he had thus ascertained her wishes, he made her his
wife: when two are of one mind, what more does secret love require?</p>
<p>Then Ni&#347;chayadatta arrived from the presence of
Somasv&aacute;min, after that <span class="corr" id="xd27e8451" title=
"Source: Vidhy&aacute;dhara">Vidy&aacute;dhara</span> had departed. And
when he came, Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, having lost her love for him,
did not embrace him, giving as an excuse that she had a headache. But
the simple-minded man, bewildered by love, not seeing through her
excuse, thought that her pain was due to illness and spent the day in
that belief. But the next day, he again went in low spirits to see his
friend the ape, flying through the air by the force of the two sciences
he possessed. When he had gone, Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;&rsquo;s
Vidy&aacute;dhara lover returned to her, having spent a sleepless night
without her. And embracing round the neck her, who was eager for his
arrival owing to having been separated during the night, he was at
length overcome by sleep. She by the power of her science concealed her
lover, who lay asleep in her lap, and weary with having kept awake all
night, went to sleep herself. In the meanwhile Ni&#347;chayadatta came
to the ape, and his friend, welcoming him, asked him&mdash;&ldquo;Why
do I seem to see you in low spirits to-day? Tell me.&rdquo; Then
Ni&#347;chayadatta said to that ape, &ldquo;Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;
is exceedingly ill, my friend; for that reason I am grieved, for she is
dearer to me than life.&rdquo; Then that ape, who possessed
supernatural knowledge, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Go, take her in your
arms asleep as she is, and flying through the air by the help of the
science she bestowed, bring her to me, in order that I may this very
day shew you a great marvel.&rdquo; When Ni&#347;chayadatta heard this,
he went through the air and lightly took up that sleeping fair, but he
did not see that Vidy&aacute;dhara, who was asleep in her lap, and had
been previously made invisible by the power of her science. And flying
up into the air, he quickly brought Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute; to that
ape. That ape, who possessed divine insight, immediately shewed him a
charm, by which he was able to behold the Vidy&aacute;dhara clinging to
her neck. When he saw this, he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! what does
this mean?&rdquo; And the ape, who was able to discern the truth, told
him the whole story. Then Ni&#347;chayadatta fell into a passion, and
the Vidy&aacute;dhara, who was the lover of his wife, woke up, and
flying up into the air, disappeared. Then Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;
woke up, and seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346"
name="pb346">346</a>]</span>that her secret was revealed, stood with
face cast down through shame. Then Ni&#347;chayadatta said to her with
eyes gushing with tears&mdash;&ldquo;Wicked female, how could you thus
deceive me who reposed confidence in you? Although a device is known in
this world for fixing that exceedingly fickle metal quicksilver, no
expedient is known for fixing the heart of a woman.&rdquo; While he was
saying this, Anur&aacute;gapar&aacute;, at a loss for an answer, and
weeping, slowly soared up into the air, and went to her own home.</p>
<p>Then Ni&#347;chayadatta&rsquo;s friend, the ape, said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;That you are grieved is the fruit of the fierce fire
of passion, in that you ran after this fair one, though I tried to
dissuade you. For what reliance can be placed on fickle fortunes and
fickle women? So cease your regret. Be patient now. For even the
Disposer himself cannot o&rsquo;erstep destiny.&rdquo; When
Ni&#347;chayadatta heard this speech from the ape, he flung aside that
delusion of grief, and abandoning passion, fled to &#346;iva as his
refuge. Then, as he was remaining in that wood with his friend the ape,
it happened that a female hermit of the name of Mokshad&aacute; came
near him. She seeing him bowing before her, proceeded to ask
him&mdash;&ldquo;How comes this strange thing to pass that, though a
man, you have struck up a friendship with this ape?&rdquo; Then he
related to her his own melancholy story and afterwards the sad tale of
his friend, and thereupon thus said to her; &ldquo;If you, reverend
lady, know any incantation or spell by which it can be done,
immediately release this excellent Br&aacute;hman, my friend, from his
ape-transformation.&rdquo; When she heard that, she consented, and
employing a spell, she loosed the string from his neck, and
Somasv&aacute;min abandoned that monkey form and became a man as
before. Then she disappeared like lightning, clothed with celestial
brightness, and in time Ni&#347;chayadatta and the Br&aacute;hman
Somasv&aacute;min, having performed many austerities, attained final
beatitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus fair ones, naturally fickle, bring about a series of
evil actions which produce true discernment, and aversion to the world.
But here and there you will find a virtuous one among them, who adorns
a glorious family, as the streak of the moon the broad sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta, accompanied by Ratnaprabh&aacute;,
heard this wonderful tale from the mouth of Gomukha, he was highly
pleased.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vikram&aacute;ditya and the
het&aelig;ra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra a king named
Vikram&aacute;ditya; he had two cherished friends the king
Hayapati,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8477src" href="#xd27e8477" name=
"xd27e8477src">1</a> and the king Gajapati,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8482src" href="#xd27e8482" name="xd27e8482src">2</a> who had
large armies of horse and elephants. And that proud sovereign had a
mighty enemy named Narasinha<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8487src" href=
"#xd27e8487" name="xd27e8487src">3</a> the lord of
Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, a king who had a large force of infantry.
Being angry with that enemy, and puffed up on account of the power of
his allies, Vikram&aacute;ditya rashly made this vow&mdash;&ldquo;I
will so completely conquer that king, the lord of men, that the heralds
and bards shall proclaim him at the door as my slave.&rdquo; Having
made this vow, he summoned those allies, Hayapati and Gajapati, and
accompanied with a large force, shaking the earth with elephants and
horses, marched with them to make a fierce attack on the lord of men,
Narasinha. When he arrived near Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, Narasinha,
the lord of men, put on his armour and went out to meet him. Then there
took place between the two kings a battle that excited wonder, in which
footmen fought with elephants and horses. And at last the army of
Vikram&aacute;ditya was routed by the forces of Narasinha, the lord of
men, which contained many crores of footmen. And Vikram&aacute;ditya,
being routed, fled to his city P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, and his two
allies fled to their own countries. And Narasinha, the lord of men,
entered his own city Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, accompanied by heralds
who praised his might.</p>
<p>Then Vikram&aacute;ditya, not having gained his end,
thought&mdash;&ldquo;Well! as that enemy is not to be conquered by
arms, I will conquer him by policy; let some blame me if they like, but
let not my oath be made void.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, he entrusted his
kingdom to suitable ministers, and secretly went out of the city with
one chief minister, named Buddhivara, and with five hundred well-born
and brave R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts and in the disguise of a candidate for
service,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8494src" href="#xd27e8494" name=
"xd27e8494src">4</a> went to Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, the city of his
enemy. There he entered the splendid mansion of a beautiful
<i>het&aelig;ra</i> named Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, that resembled the
palace of a king. It seemed to invite him with the silk of its banners,
hoisted on the pinnacles of high ramparts, the points of which waved to
and fro in the soft breeze. It was guarded at the principal entrance,
the east door, day and night, by twenty thousand footmen, equipped with
all kinds of weapons. At each of the other three doors, looking towards
the other cardinal points, it was defended by ten thousand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>warriors ever on the <i>qui vive</i>. In such
guise the king entered, proclaimed by the warders, the enclosure of the
palace, which was divided into seven zones. In one zone it was adorned
with many long lines of horses. In another the path was impeded by
dense troops of elephants. In another it was surrounded with an
imposing array of dense weapons. In another it was resplendent with
many treasure-houses, that gleamed with the flash of jewels. In another
a circle was always formed by a dense crowd of attendants. In another
it was full of the noise of many bards reciting aloud, and in another
resounding with the sound of drums beaten in concert. Beholding all
these sights the king at last reached, with his retinue, the splendid
edifice in which Madanam&aacute;l&aacute; dwelt. She having heard with
great interest from her attendants that, as he passed through the
zones, the horses and other creatures were cured of their
wounds,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8508src" href="#xd27e8508" name=
"xd27e8508src">5</a> thought that he must be some great one in
disguise, and so she went to meet him, and bowed before him with love
and curiosity, and bringing him in, seated him on a throne fit for a
king. The king&rsquo;s heart was ravished by her beauty, gracefulness
and courtesy, and he saluted her without revealing who he was. Then
Madanam&aacute;l&aacute; honoured that king with costly baths, flowers,
perfumes, garments and ornaments. And she gave daily subsistence to
those followers of his, and feasted him and his minister with all kinds
of viands. And she spent the day with him in drinking, and other
diversions, and surrendered herself to him, having fallen in love with
him at first sight. Vikram&aacute;ditya, being thus entertained by her,
day by day, continued, though in disguise, to live in a style suited to
an emperor. And whatever and howmuchsoever wealth he was in the habit
of giving to suppliants, Madanam&aacute;l&aacute; gladly furnished him
with from her own store. And she thought her body and wealth well
employed, while enjoyed by him, and she remained averse to gain and to
other men. For out of love to him she even kept off by stratagems
Narasinha, the king of that land, who came there being enamoured of
her.</p>
<p>While the king was being waited on in this fashion by
Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, he one day said in secret to his minister
Buddhivara, who accompanied him, &ldquo;A <i>het&aelig;ra</i> desires
wealth, and not even if she feels love, does she become attached
without it, for when Providence framed suitors, he bestowed greed on
these women. But this Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, though her wealth is
being consumed by me, through her great love is not estranged from me,
on the contrary she delights in me. So how can I now make her a
recompense, in order that my vow may in course of time be fully
accomplished?&rdquo; When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href=
"#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>the minister Buddhivara heard
this, he said to the king; &ldquo;If this be so, give her some of those
priceless jewels which the mendicant Prapanchabuddhi gave you.&rdquo;
When the king heard that, he answered him, &ldquo;If I were to give
them all to her, I should not have made her a recompense worth speaking
of; but I can free myself from obligation in another way, which is
connected also with the story of that mendicant.&rdquo; When the
minister heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;King, why did that mendicant
court you? Tell me his story.&rdquo; When his minister Buddhivara
proffered this request, the king said, &ldquo;Listen: I will tell you
his story.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vikram&aacute;ditya and the treacherous
mendicant.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long<a id="xd27e8529" name="xd27e8529"></a> ago a
mendicant named Prapanchabuddhi used to enter my hall of audience in
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra every day and give me a box. For a whole year
I gave these boxes, just as they were, unopened into the hand of my
treasurer. One day, one of those boxes presented by the mendicant by
chance fell from my hand on to the ground, and burst open. And a great
jewel fell out of it, glittering like fire, and it appeared as if it
were the mendicant&rsquo;s heart which I had not discerned before,
revealed by him. When I saw that, I took it, and I had those other
boxes brought which he had presented to me, and opened them, and took a
jewel out of every one of them. Then in astonishment I asked
Prapanchabuddhi&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you court me with such splendid
jewels?&rdquo; Then that mendicant took me aside, and said to
me&mdash;&ldquo;On the fourteenth day of the black fortnight now
approaching I have to perform a certain incantation at night-fall, in a
cemetery outside this town. I desire you, my hero, to come and take
part in that enterprise, for success is easily obtained, when the
obstacles to it are swept away by the aid of a hero.&rdquo; When the
mendicant said this to me, I agreed. So he went off delighted, and in a
few days the fourteenth night of the black fortnight came, and I
remembered the speech of that ascetic.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8531src" href="#xd27e8531" name="xd27e8531src">6</a> Then I
performed my daily observances, and waited for the night, and after I
had recited the evening prayer, it happened that I rapidly fell asleep.
Then the adorable Hari, who is compassionate to his votaries, appeared
to me in a dream, mounted on Garu&#7693;a, with his breast marked with
a lotus, and thus commanded me&mdash;&ldquo;My son, this
Prapanchabuddhi<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8537src" href="#xd27e8537"
name="xd27e8537src">7</a> is rightly named, for he will inveigle you
into the cemetery to take part in the incantation of the
circle,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8542src" href="#xd27e8542" name=
"xd27e8542src">8</a> and will offer you up as a victim. So do not do
what he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>tells you to do with the object of slaying you,
but say to him&mdash;&lsquo;You do it first, and when I have learned
the way, I will do it.&rsquo; Then, as he is shewing you the way, take
advantage of the opportunity, and slay him immediately, and you will
acquire the power that he desires to obtain.&rdquo; When Vish&#7751;u
had said this, he disappeared, and I woke up and
thought&mdash;&ldquo;By the favour of Hari I have detected that
magician, and this day I must slay him.&rdquo; Having thus reflected,
when the first watch of the night was gone, I went, sword in hand,
alone to that cemetery. There I beheld that mendicant, who had
performed the ceremony of the circle incantation, and when the
treacherous fellow saw me, he welcomed me, and said, &ldquo;King, close
your eyes, and fall at full length on the ground with your face
downwards, and in this way both of us will attain our ends.&rdquo; Then
I answered him&mdash;&ldquo;Do it yourself first. Shew me how to do it,
and, after I have learned, I will do precisely as you do.&rdquo; When
the mendicant heard that, like a fool, he fell on the earth, and I cut
off his head with a stroke of my sword.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8548src" href="#xd27e8548" name="xd27e8548src">9</a> Then a voice
was heard from the air&mdash;&ldquo;Bravo, king! By offering up to-day
this rascally mendicant thou hast obtained the power of going through
the air, which he wished to obtain. I, the god of wealth, that move
about at will, am pleased with thy courage. So, ask me for another
boon, whatever thou mayest desire.&rdquo; After saying this, he
manifested himself, and I, bowing before him, said,&mdash;&ldquo;When I
shall supplicate thee, adorable one, thou shalt appear on my thinking
of thee, and grant me a suitable boon.&rdquo; The god of wealth
said&mdash;&ldquo;So be it&rdquo;&mdash;and disappeared. And having
obtained magic power, I went back quickly to my own palace. Thus I have
told you my adventure, so by means of that boon of Kuvera I must now
recompense Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;. And you must now go back to
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra, taking with you my disguised
R&aacute;jp&uacute;t retinue, and I, as soon as I have in a novel way
recompensed my beloved, will immediately go there, with the intention
of returning here.&rdquo; Having said this, and having performed his
daily duties, the king dismissed his minister with his retinue. He
said, &ldquo;So be it&rdquo; and departed, and the king spent that
night with Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, anxious about his approaching
separation. She too, embracing him frequently, because her heart seemed
to tell her that he was going to a distance, did not sleep all that
night.</p>
<p>In the morning the king, having performed all his necessary duties,
entered a chapel for the daily worship of the gods, on the pretence of
repeating prayers. And there the god of wealth appeared before him on
his thinking of him, and bowing before him the king craved that boon
formerly promised, in the following words&mdash;&ldquo;O god, give me
here to-day in accordance with that boon, which you promised me, five
great indestructible golden figures of men, such that, though their
limbs may be continually cut off for any desired use, those very limbs
will grow again, exactly as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href=
"#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>before.&rdquo; The god of wealth
said, &ldquo;Even so; be there unto thee five such figures as thou
desirest!&rdquo; Having said this, he immediately disappeared. And the
king immediately beheld those five great golden figures of men suddenly
standing in the chapel; then he went out delighted, and not forgetting
his promise, he flew up into the air and went to his city of
P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. There he was welcomed by his ministers, and
the citizens and his wives, and he remained engaged in his kingly
duties, while his heart was far away in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na. In
the meanwhile, in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, that beloved of his
entered that chapel to see her love, who had entered it long before.
And when she entered, she did not perceive that beloved king anywhere,
but she beheld five gigantic golden figures of men. When she saw them,
and did not find him, she reflected in her grief&mdash;&ldquo;Surely
that love of mine was some Vidy&aacute;dhara or Gandharva, who bestowed
upon me these men and flew away up to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what am I to do with these figures, which are all a mere
burden, now that I am deprived of him?&rdquo; Thus reflecting she asked
her servants over and over again for news of him, and went out and
roamed all about her domain. And she found no satisfaction anywhere,
either in the palaces, the gardens, the chambers or other places, but
she kept lamenting, grieved at being separated from her lover, ready to
abandon the body.</p>
<p>Her attendants tried to comfort her, saying, &ldquo;Do not despair,
mistress, for he is some god roaming about at will, and when he
pleases, he will return to you, fair one.&rdquo; With such
hope-inspiring words did they at length so far console her that she
made this vow&mdash;&ldquo;If in six months he does not grant me to
behold him, I will give away all my property and enter the fire.&rdquo;
With this promise she fortified herself, and remained every day giving
alms, thinking on that beloved of hers. And one day, she cut off both
the arms of one of those golden men, and gave them to the
Br&aacute;hmans, being intent on charity only. And the next day she
perceived with astonishment that both arms had grown again, exactly as
they were before. Then she proceeded to cut off the arms of the others,
to give them away, and the arms of all of them grew again as they were
before. Then she saw that they were indestructible, and every day she
cut off the arms of the figures and gave them to studious
Br&aacute;hmans, according to the number of the Vedas they had
read.</p>
<p>And in a few days a Br&aacute;hman, named Sangr&aacute;madatta,
having heard the fame of her bounty, which was spread abroad in every
direction, came from P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. He being poor, but
acquainted with four Vedas, and endowed with virtues, entered into her
presence desiring a gift, being announced by the door-keepers. She gave
him as many arms of the golden figures as he knew Vedas, after bowing
before him with limbs emaciated with her vow and pale with separation
from her beloved. Then the Br&aacute;hman, having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>heard from her sorrow-stricken attendants the
whole of her story, ending in that very terrible vow, was delighted,
but at the same time despondent, and loading two camels with those
golden arms went to his native city, P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra. Then
that Br&aacute;hman, thinking that his gold would not be safe there,
unless guarded by the king, entered the king&rsquo;s presence and said
to him, while he was sitting in the hall of judgment; &ldquo;Here I am,
O great king, a Br&aacute;hman who am an inhabitant of thy town. I,
being poor, and desiring wealth, went to the southern clime, and
arrived at a city named Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, belonging to king
Narasinha. There, being desirous of a donation, I went to the house of
Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, a <i>het&aelig;ra</i> of distinguished fame.
For with her there lived long some divine being, who departed somewhere
or other, after giving her five indestructible figures of men. Then the
high-spirited woman became afflicted at his departure, and considering
life to be poison-agony, and the body, that fruitless accumulation of
delusion, to be merely a punishment for thieving, lost her patience,
and being with difficulty consoled by her attendants made this
vow&mdash;&ldquo;If in the space of six months he does not visit me, I
must enter the fire, my soul being smitten by adversity.&rdquo; Having
made this vow she, being resolved on death, and desiring to perform
good actions, gives away every day very large gifts. And I beheld her,
king, with tottering feet, conspicuous for the beauty of her person,
though it was thin from fasting; with hand moistened with the water of
giving, surrounded with maids like clustering bees, sorely afflicted,
looking like the incarnation of the <i>mast</i> condition of the
elephant of love.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8572src" href="#xd27e8572"
name="xd27e8572src">10</a> And I think that lover who deserts her, and
causes by his absence that fair one to abandon the body, deserves
blame, indeed deserves death. She to-day gave to me, who know the four
Vedas, four golden arms of human figures, according to right usage,
proportioning her gift to the number of my Vedas. So I wish to purify
my house with sacrifice, and to follow a life of religion here;
therefore let the king grant me protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king Vikram&aacute;ditya, hearing <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8586" title="Source: this">these</span> tidings of his beloved
from the mouth of the Br&aacute;hman, had his mind suddenly turned
towards her. And he commanded his door-keeper to do what the
Br&aacute;hman wished, and thinking how constant was the affection of
his mistress, who valued her life as stubble, and in his impatience
supposing that she would be able to assist him in accomplishing his
vow, and remembering that the time fixed for her abandoning the body
had almost arrived, he quickly committed his kingdom to the care of his
ministers, and flying through the air reached
Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>and entered the house of his
beloved. There he beheld his beloved, with raiment pellucid like the
moonlight, having given her wealth away to
Pa&#7751;&#7693;its,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8591src" href=
"#xd27e8591" name="xd27e8591src">11</a> attenuated like a digit of the
moon at the time of its change. Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, for her part,
on beholding him arrived unexpectedly, the quintessence of nectar to
her eyes, was for a moment like one amazed. Then she embraced him, and
threw round his neck the noose of her arms, as if fearing that he would
escape again. And she said to him with a voice, the accents of which
were choked with tears, &ldquo;Cruel one, why did you depart and
forsake my innocent self?&rdquo; The king said, &ldquo;Come, I will
tell you in private,&rdquo; and went inside with her, welcomed by her
attendants. There he revealed to her who he was, and described his
circumstances, how he came there to conquer king Narasinha by an
artifice, and how, after slaying Prapanchabuddhi, he acquired the power
of flying in the air, and how he was enabled to reward her by a boon
that he obtained from the lord of wealth, and how, hearing tidings of
her from a Br&aacute;hman, he had returned there. Having told the whole
story beginning with the subject of his vow, he again said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;So my beloved, that king Narasinha, being very mighty,
is not to be conquered by armies, and he contended with me in single
combat, but I did not slay him, for I possess the power of flying in
the air, and he can only go on the earth, for who, that is a true
Kshatriya, would desire to conquer in an unfair combat? The object of
my vow is, that that king may be announced by the heralds as waiting at
the door; do you assist me in that<span class="corr" id="xd27e8597"
title="Source: .">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the <i>het&aelig;ra</i> heard this, she said, &ldquo;I am
honoured by your request,&rdquo; and summoning her heralds she said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;When the king Narasinha shall come to my house, you
must stand near the door with attentive eyes, and while he is entering,
you must say again and again&mdash;&ldquo;King, prince Narasinha is
loyal and devoted to thee.&rdquo; And when he looks up and
asks&mdash;&ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo;&mdash;you must immediately say to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Vikram&aacute;ditya is here.&rdquo; After giving them
these orders, she dismissed them, and then she said to the female
warder&mdash;&ldquo;You must not prevent king Narasinha from entering
here.&rdquo; After issuing these orders, Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;
remained in a state of supreme felicity, having regained the lord of
her life, and gave away her wealth fearlessly.</p>
<p>Then king Narasinha, having heard of that profuse liberality of
hers, which was due to her possession of the golden figures, though he
had given her up, came to visit her house. And while he entered, not
being forbidden by the warder, all the heralds shouted in a loud voice,
beginning at the outer door, &ldquo;King, prince Narasinha is
submissive and devoted.&rdquo; When that sovereign heard that, he was
angry and alarmed, and when he asked who was there, and found out that
king Vikram&aacute;ditya was there, he waited <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>a
moment and went through the following reflections; &ldquo;So this king
has forced his way into my kingdom, and carried out the vow he made
long ago, that I should be announced at his door. In truth this king is
a man of might, since he has thus beaten me to-day. And I must not slay
him by force, since he has come alone to a house in my dominions. So I
had better enter now.&rdquo; Having thus reflected, king Narasinha
entered, announced by all the heralds. And king Vikram&aacute;ditya, on
beholding him enter with a smile on his face, rose up also with smiling
countenance and embraced him. Then those two kings sat down and
enquired after one another&rsquo;s welfare, while
Madanam&aacute;l&aacute; stood by their side.</p>
<p>And in the course of conversation Narasinha asked
Vikram&aacute;ditya where he had obtained those golden figures. Then
Vikram&aacute;ditya told him the whole of that strange adventure of
his, how he had slain the base ascetic, and acquired the power of
flying through the air, and how, by virtue of the boon of the god of
wealth, he had obtained five indestructible gigantic golden figures.
Then king Narasinha chose that king for his friend, discovering that he
was of great might, that he possessed the power of flying, and that he
had a good heart. And having made him his friend, he welcomed him with
the prescribed rites of hospitality, and taking him to his own palace,
he entertained him with all the attentions paid to himself. And king
Vikram&aacute;ditya, after having been thus honoured, was dismissed by
him, and returned to the house of Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;. Then
Vikram&aacute;ditya, having accomplished his difficult vow by his
courage and intelligence, determined to go to his own city. And
Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;, being unable to remain separated from him,
was eager to accompany him, and with the intention of abandoning her
native land, she bestowed her dwelling upon the Br&aacute;hmans. Then
Vikram&aacute;ditya, the moon of kings, went with her, whose mind was
exclusively fixed on him, to his own city of P&aacute;&#7789;aliputra,
followed by her elephants, horses, and footmen. There he remained in
happiness, (accompanied by <span class="corr" id="xd27e8611" title=
"Source: Madanam&aacute;la">Madanam&aacute;l&aacute;</span>, who had
abandoned her own country for his love,) having formed an alliance with
king Narasinha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, king, even <i>het&aelig;r&aelig;</i> are occasionally
of noble character and as faithful to kings as their own wives, much
more then matrons of high birth.&rdquo; On hearing this noble tale from
the mouth of Marubh&uacute;ti, the king Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and his
new wife Ratnaprabh&aacute; sprung from the glorious race of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, were much delighted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Story of &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja and the daughter of
the R&aacute;kshasa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city on the earth named Vardham&aacute;na,
and in it there dwelt a king named V&iacute;rabhuja, chief of righteous
men. And though he had a hundred wives, one queen of the name of
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; was dearer to him than his life. And in spite of
his hundred wives, it happened, as Fate would have it, that not one of
them bore him a son. So he asked a physician named
&#346;rutavardhana&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any medicine able to bring
about the birth of a son?&rdquo; When the physician heard that, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;King, I can prepare such a medicine,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8631src" href="#xd27e8631" name="xd27e8631src">1</a>
but the king must procure for me a wild goat.&rdquo; When he heard this
speech of the physician&rsquo;s, the king gave an order to the warder,
and had a goat brought for him from the forest. The physician handed
over the goat to the king&rsquo;s cooks, and with its flesh prepared a
sovereign elixir for the queens. The king went off to worship his god,
after ordering the queens to assemble in one place. And ninety-nine of
those queens did assemble in one place, but the queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; alone was not present there, for she was at that
time near the king, who was engaged in praying to his god. And when
they had assembled, the physician gave them the whole of the elixir to
drink mixed with powder, not perceiving the absence of
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;. Immediately the king returned with his beloved,
having performed his devotions, and perceiving that that drug was
completely finished, he said to the physician&mdash;&ldquo;What! did
you not keep any for Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;? You have forgotten the
principal object with which this was undertaken.&rdquo; After saying
this to the abashed physician, the king said to the
cooks&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any of the flesh of that goat left?&rdquo;
The cooks said, &ldquo;The horns only remain.&rdquo; Then the physician
said, &ldquo;Bravo! I can make an admirable elixir out of the centre of
the horns.&rdquo; After saying this, the physician had an elixir
prepared from the fleshy part of the horns, and gave it to queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; mixed with powder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>Then the ninety-nine
wives of the king became pregnant, and all in time brought forth sons.
But the head queen Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; conceived last of all, and
afterwards gave birth to a son with more auspicious marks than the sons
of all the others. And as he was sprung from the juice of the fleshy
part of the horns, his father, the king, gave him the name of
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, and rejoiced greatly at his birth. He grew up
with those other brothers, and though in age he was the youngest of
all, he was superior to all in good qualities. And in course of time
that prince became like the god of Love in beauty, and like Arjuna in
his skill in archery, and like Bh&iacute;ma in strength. Accordingly
the other queens, seeing that queen Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, now that she
had this son, was more than ever dear to king V&iacute;rabhuja, became
jealous of her.</p>
<p>Then an evil-minded queen among them, named Aya&#347;olekh&aacute;,
deliberated with all the others and entered into a conspiracy; and when
the king came home one day, she exhibited an assumed sadness in her
face. The king asked her the reason, and she said with apparent
reluctance&mdash;&ldquo;My husband, why do you endure patiently the
disgrace of your house? you avert disgrace from others, why do you not
avert it from yourself? You know the young superintendent of the
women&rsquo;s apartments named Surakshita; your queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; is secretly devoted to him. Since no man but he
can penetrate into the women&rsquo;s apartments, which are strictly
watched by guards, she associates with him. And this is a well-known
subject of gossip in the whole harem.&rdquo; When she said this to the
king, he pondered and reflected; and went and asked the other queens
one after another in private, and they were faithful to their
treacherous plot, and told him the same story. Then that wise king
conquered his anger, and reflected&mdash;&ldquo;This accusation against
these two is improbable, and yet such is the gossip. So I must not
without reflecting reveal the matter to any one; but they must by an
artifice be separated now, to enable me to see the termination of the
whole matter.&rdquo; Having determined on this, next day he summoned
Surakshita, the superintendent of the womens&rsquo; apartments, into
his judgment-hall, and with assumed anger, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;I
have learned, villain, that you have slain a Br&aacute;hman, so I
cannot endure to see your face until you have made a pilgrimage to holy
places.&rdquo; When he heard that, he was amazed and began to
murmur&mdash;&ldquo;How can I have slain a Br&aacute;hman, my
sovereign?&rdquo; But the king went on to say; &ldquo;Do not attempt to
brazen it out, but go to K&aacute;&#347;m&iacute;r to wash away your
sin, (where are those holy fields, <span class="corr" id="xd27e8663"
title="Source: Vijayakhetra">Vijayakshetra</span>, and Nandikshetra the
purifying, and the <i>kshetra</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e8668src"
href="#xd27e8668" name="xd27e8668src">2</a> of the Boar<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e8673" title="Source: ,)">),</span> the land which was
hallowed by Vish&#7751;u the bow-handed god, where the stream of the
Ganges bears the name of Vitast&aacute;, where is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>famous Ma&#7751;&#7693;apakshetra, and where is
Uttaram&aacute;nasa; when your sin has been washed away by a pilgrimage
to these holy places, you shall behold my face again, but not till
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this speech the king V&iacute;rabhuja dismissed the helpless
Surakshita, sending him to a distance on the pretence of a pilgrimage
to holy places. Then the king went into the presence of that queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, full of love and anger and sober reflection.
Then she, seeing that his mind was troubled, asked him anxiously,
&ldquo;My husband, why are you seized to-day with a sudden fit of
despondency?&rdquo; When the king heard that, he gave her this feigned
answer&mdash;&ldquo;To-day, queen, a great astrologer came to me and
said&mdash;&lsquo;King, you must place the queen Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;
for some time in a dungeon, and you must yourself live a life of
chastity, otherwise your kingdom will certainly be overthrown, and she
will surely die.&rsquo; Having said this, the astrologer departed;
hence my present despondency.&rdquo; When the king said this, the queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, who was devoted to her husband, distracted with
fear and love, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you not cast me this
very day into a dungeon, my husband? I am highly favoured, if I can
benefit you even at the sacrifice of my life. Let me die, but let not
my lord have misfortune. For a husband is the chief refuge of wives in
this world and in the next.&rdquo; Having heard this speech of hers,
the king said to himself with tears in his eyes; &ldquo;I think there
is no guilt in her, nor in that Surakshita, for I saw that the colour
of his face did not change, and he seemed without fear. Alas!
nevertheless I must ascertain the truth of that rumour.&rdquo; After
reflecting thus, the king in his grief said to the
queen&mdash;&ldquo;Then it is best that a dungeon should be made here,
queen!&rdquo; She replied&mdash;&ldquo;Very good&rdquo;&mdash;so the
king had a dungeon easy of access made in the women&rsquo;s apartments,
and placed the queen in it. And he comforted her son
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, (who was in despair and asked the reason,) by
telling him exactly what he told the queen. And she, for her part,
thought the dungeon heaven, because it was all for the king&rsquo;s
good. For good women have no pleasure of their own; to them their
husbands&rsquo; pleasure is pleasure.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8680src" href="#xd27e8680" name="xd27e8680src">3</a></p>
<p>When this had been done, that other wife of the king&rsquo;s, named
Aya&#347;olekh&aacute;, said of her own accord to her son, who was
named Nirv&aacute;sabhuja,&mdash;&ldquo;So, our enemy
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; has been thrown into a dungeon, and it would be a
good thing if her son were banished from this country. So, my boy,
devise a scheme with the help of your other brothers by which
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja may be quickly banished from the country.&rdquo;
Having been addressed in this language by his mother, the jealous
Nirv&aacute;sabhuja told his other brothers, and continued to ponder
over a scheme. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>And one day, as the king&rsquo;s sons were practising with their
weapons of war, they all saw an enormous crane in front of the palace.
And while they were looking with astonishment at that misshapen bird, a
Buddhist mendicant, who possessed supernatural knowledge, came that way
and said to them&mdash;&ldquo;Princes, this is not a crane, it is a
R&aacute;kshasa named Agni&#347;ikha, who wanders about in an assumed
shape destroying towns. So pierce him with an arrow, that being smitten
he may depart hence.&rdquo; When they heard this speech of the
mendicant&rsquo;s, the ninety-nine elder brothers shot their arrows,
but not one struck the crane. Then that naked mendicant again said to
them&mdash;&ldquo;This younger brother of yours, named
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, is able to strike this crane, so let him take a
bow suitable for the purpose.&rdquo; When Nirv&aacute;sabhuja heard
that, the treacherous one remembered the injunction of his mother, an
opportunity for carrying out which had now arrived, and
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;This will be a means of getting
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja out of the country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8688src" href="#xd27e8688" name="xd27e8688src">4</a> So let us
give him the bow and arrow belonging to our father. If the crane is
pierced and goes off with our father&rsquo;s golden arrow sticking in
it, &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja will follow it, while we are searching for
the arrow. And when he does not find, in spite of his search, that
R&aacute;kshasa transformed into a crane, he will continue to roam
about hither and thither, he will not come back without the
arrow.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the treacherous one gave to
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja his father&rsquo;s bow with the arrow, in order
that he might smite the crane. The mighty prince took it and drew it,
and pierced that crane with the golden arrow, the notch of which was
made of a jewel. The crane, as soon as it was pierced, went off with
the arrow sticking in its body, and flying away departed with drops of
blood falling from the wound. Then the treacherous Nirv&aacute;sabhuja
and the other brothers, instigated by his hints, said to the brave
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja&mdash;&ldquo;Give us back the golden arrow that
belongs to our father, otherwise we will abandon our bodies before your
eyes. For unless we produce it, our father will banish us from this
country, and its fellow is not to be made or obtained.&rdquo; When
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja heard that, he said to those crafty
ones&mdash;&ldquo;Be of good cheer! Do not be afraid&mdash;Abandon your
terror! I will go and slay that miserable R&aacute;kshasa and bring
back the arrow.&rdquo; Having said this, &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja took
his own bow and arrows, and went in the same direction in which the
R&aacute;kshasa had gone, quickly following up the track of the drops
of blood, that had fallen on the ground. The other sons returned
delighted to their mothers, and &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, as he went on
step by step, at last reached a distant forest. Seeking about in it, he
found in the wood a great city, like the fruit of his own tree of merit
fallen to him in due time for enjoyment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the root of a tree to rest, and as if in a moment beheld a maiden of
wonderful beauty coming there, appearing to have been made by the
Creator in some strange way of ambrosia and poison; since by her
absence she deprived of life, and by her presence she bestowed it. And
when the maiden slowly approached him, and looked at him with an eye
raining love, the prince fell in love with her and said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Gazelle-eyed one, what is the name of this city, and
to whom does it belong? Who are you, and why have you come here? tell
me.&rdquo; Then the pearly-toothed maid turned her face sideways, and
fixed her eye on the ground, and spake to him with sweet and loving
voice&mdash;&ldquo;This city is Dh&uacute;mapura, the home of all
felicity; in it lives a mighty R&aacute;kshasa by name Agni&#347;ikha;
know that I am his matchless daughter, R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; by
name, who have come here with mind captivated by your unparalleled
beauty. Now <span class="corr" id="xd27e8696" title=
"Source: you you">you</span> must tell me who you are, and why you have
come here.&rdquo; When she said this, he told her who he was, and of
what king he was the son, and how he had come to Dh&uacute;mapura for
the sake of an arrow. Then R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, having heard
the whole story, said&mdash;&ldquo;There is no archer like you in the
three worlds, since you pierced even my father with a great arrow, when
he was in the form of a crane. And I took that golden arrow for my own,
by way of a plaything. But my father&rsquo;s wound was at once healed
by the minister Mah&aacute;dansh&#7789;ra, who excels all men in
knowledge of potent drugs for curing wounds. So I will go to my father,
and after I have explained the whole matter, I will quickly introduce
you into his presence, my husband; so I call you, for my heart is now
fully set upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; left
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja there, and immediately went into the presence of
her father Agni&#347;ikha, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Father, there has come
here a wonderful prince named &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, matchless for
gifts of beauty, birth, character and age. I feel certain that he is
not a man, he is some portion of a god incarnate here below, so, if he
does not become my husband, I will certainly abandon my life.&rdquo;
When she said this to him, her father the R&aacute;kshasa said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;My daughter, men are our appropriate food,
nevertheless, if your heart is set upon it, let it be so; bring your
prince here, and shew him to me.&rdquo; When
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; heard that, she went to
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, and after telling him what she had done, she
took him into the presence of her father. He prostrated himself, and
Agni&#347;ikha, the father of the maiden, after saluting him
courteously, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, I will give you my
daughter R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, if you never disobey my
orders.&rdquo; When he said this, &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, bending low,
answered him&mdash;&ldquo;Good! I will never disobey your
orders.&rdquo; When &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja said this to him,
Agni&#347;ikha was pleased and answered&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up! Go and
bathe, and return here from the bath-room.&rdquo; After saying this to
him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>he said to his daughter&mdash;&ldquo;Go and
bring all your sisters here quickly.&rdquo; When <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8703" title="Source: Agnisikha">Agni&#347;ikha</span> had given
these orders to &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja and
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, they both of them went out, after
promising to obey them.</p>
<p>Then the wise R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; said to
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja&mdash;&ldquo;My husband, I have a hundred
sisters, who are princesses, and we are all exactly alike, with similar
ornaments and dresses, and all of us have similar necklaces upon our
necks. So our father will assemble us in one place, and in order to
bewilder you, will say &lsquo;Choose your own love out of the midst of
these.&rsquo; For I know that such is his treacherous intention,
otherwise why is he assembling all of us here. So when we are
assembled, I will put my necklace on my head instead of my neck, by
that sign you will recognise me; then throw over my neck the garland of
forest flowers. And this father of mine is somewhat silly, he has not a
discerning intellect; besides what is the use against me of those
powers which he possesses by being a R&aacute;kshasa? So, whatever he
says to entrap you, you must agree to, and must tell it to me, and I
shall know well enough what further steps to take.&rdquo; Having said
this, R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; went to her sisters, and
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, having agreed to do what she said, went to
bathe. Then R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; came with her sisters into the
presence of her father, and &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja returned, after he
had been washed by a female servant. Then Agni&#347;ikha gave a garland
of forest flowers to &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, saying, &ldquo;Give this
to that one of these ladies, who is your own love.&rdquo; He took the
garland and threw it round the neck of
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8708src" href=
"#xd27e8708" name="xd27e8708src">5</a> who had previously placed the
necklace on her head by way of token. Then Agni&#347;ikha said to
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; and &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja,&mdash;&ldquo;I
will celebrate your marriage ceremony to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, he dismissed those two lovers and his other
daughters to their apartments, and in a short time he summoned
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja and said this to him; &ldquo;Take this yoke of
oxen, and go outside this town, and sow in the earth the hundred
<i>kh&aacute;r&iacute;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e8736src" href=
"#xd27e8736" name="xd27e8736src">6</a> of sesame-seed which are piled
there in a heap.&rdquo; When <span class="corr" id="xd27e8742" title=
"Source: &#346;ringabhuja">&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja</span> heard that, he
was troubled, and he went and told it to R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;,
and she answered him as follows&mdash;&ldquo;My husband, you need not
be in the least despondent about this, go there at once; I will easily
perform this by my magic power.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>When he heard this,
the prince went there, and, seeing the sesame-seeds in a heap,
despondently began to plough the land and sow them, but while he was
beginning, he saw the land ploughed and all the seeds sown in due
course by the might of his lady-love&rsquo;s magic power, and he was
much astonished.</p>
<p>So he went to Agni&#347;ikha, and told him that this task was
accomplished; then that treacherous R&aacute;kshasa again said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;I do not want the seeds sown, go and pile them up
again in a heap.&rdquo; When he heard that, he again went and told
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;. She sent him to that field, and created
innumerable ants,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8749src" href="#xd27e8749"
name="xd27e8749src">7</a> and by her magic power made them gather
together the sesame-seeds. When &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja saw that, he
went and told Agni&#347;ikha that the seeds had been piled up again in
a heap.</p>
<p>Then the cunning but stupid Agni&#347;ikha said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Only two <i>yojanas</i> from this place, in a
southerly direction, there is an empty temple of &#346;iva in a wood.
In it lives my dear brother Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha&mdash;go there at
once, and say this in front of the temple,
&lsquo;Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha, I am sent by Agni&#347;ikha as a
messenger to invite you and your retinue: come quickly, for to-morrow
the ceremony of R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;&rsquo;s marriage is to
take place.&rsquo; Having said this, come back here to-day with speed,
and to-morrow marry my daughter R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;.&rdquo;
When &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja was thus addressed by the rascal, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;So be it&rdquo;&mdash;and went and recounted the
whole to R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;. The good girl gave him some
earth, some water, some thorns, and some fire, and her own fleet horse,
and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Mount this horse and go to that temple,
and quickly repeat that invitation to Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha as it was
told to you, and then you must at once return on this horse at full
gallop, and you must often turn your head and look round; and if you
see Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha coming after you, you must throw this earth
behind you in his way; if in spite of that, Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha
pursues you, you must in the same manner fling the water behind you in
his path; if in spite of that he comes on, you must in like manner
throw these thorns in his way. If in spite of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>them
he pursues, throw this fire in his way; and if you do this, you will
return here without the Daitya; so do not hesitate&mdash;go, you shall
to-day behold the power of my magic.&rdquo;&mdash;When she said this to
him, &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja took the earth and the other things and
said, &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and mounting her horse went to the
temple in the wood. There he saw an image of &#346;iva, with one of
P&aacute;rvat&iacute; on his left and one of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8770" title="Source: Gane&#347;a">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</span> on his
right, and, after bowing before the Lord of the Universe,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8773src" href="#xd27e8773" name="xd27e8773src">8</a>
he quickly addressed to Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha the form of invitation
told him by Agni&#347;ikha, and fled from the place at full speed,
urging on his horse. And he soon turned his head and looked round, and
he beheld Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha coming after him. And he quickly threw
that earth behind him in his way, and the earth, so flung, immediately
produced a great mountain. When he saw that the R&aacute;kshasa had,
though with difficulty, climbed over that mountain, and was coming on,
the prince in the same way threw the water behind him. That produced a
great river in his path with rolling waves: the R&aacute;kshasa with
difficulty got across it and was coming on, when &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja
quickly strewed those thorns behind him. They produced a dense thorny
wood in Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha&rsquo;s path. When the R&aacute;kshasa
emerged from it, the prince threw the fire behind him, which set on
fire the path with the herbs and the trees. When Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha
saw that the fire was hard to cross, like
Kh&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;ava,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8778src" href=
"#xd27e8778" name="xd27e8778src">9</a> he returned home, tired and
terrified. For on that occasion the R&aacute;kshasa was so bewildered
by the magic of R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; that he went and returned
on his feet, he did not think of flying through the air.</p>
<p>Then &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja returned to Dh&uacute;mapura, free from
fear, commending in his heart that display of his love&rsquo;s magic
power. He gave up the horse to the delighted
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, and related his adventure, and then went
in to the presence of Agni&#347;ikha. He said, &ldquo;I went and
invited your brother Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha.&rdquo; When he said this,
Agni&#347;ikha being perplexed, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;If you really
went there, mention some peculiarity of the place.&rdquo; When the
crafty R&aacute;kshasa said this to &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, he answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, I will tell you a token: in that temple there
is a figure of P&aacute;rvat&iacute; on the left side of &#346;iva, and
of <span class="corr" id="xd27e8787" title=
"Source: Gane&#347;a">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</span> on his right.&rdquo;
When Agni&#347;ikha heard that, he was astonished and thought for a
moment&mdash;&ldquo;What! did he go there, and was my brother not able
to devour him? Then he cannot be a mere man, he must be a god, so let
him marry my daughter, as he is a fitting match for her.&rdquo; After
thus reflecting, he sent &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja as a successful suitor
to <span class="corr" id="xd27e8790" title=
"Source: R&uacute;pasikha">R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;</span>, but he
never suspected that there was a traitor in his own family. So
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja went, eager for his marriage, and after eating
and drinking with her, managed somehow to get through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>the
night. And the next morning Agni&#347;ikha gave to him
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; with all the magnificence appropriate to
his magic power, according to due form, in the presence of the fire.
Little in common have R&aacute;kshasas&rsquo; daughters and princes,
and strange the union of such! Wonderful indeed are the results of our
deeds in a previous state of existence! The prince, after he had
obtained that beloved daughter of the R&aacute;kshasa, seemed like a
swan who had got hold of a soft lotus, sprung from mud. And he remained
there with her, who was devoted to him alone, enjoying various dainty
delights provided by the magic power of the R&aacute;kshasa.</p>
<p>When some days had passed there, he said in secret to the
R&aacute;kshasa&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;Come, my beloved, let us
return to the city of Vardham&aacute;na. For that is my capital city,
and I cannot endure to be banished from my capital city by my enemies,
for people like myself hold honour dear as life. So leave for my sake
the land of your birth, though it is hard to leave; inform your father,
and bring that golden arrow in your hand.&rdquo; When
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja said this to R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, she
answered&mdash;&ldquo;I must immediately obey your command. I care not
for the land of my birth, nor for my relatives, you are all those to
me.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8797src" href="#xd27e8797" name=
"xd27e8797src">10</a> Good women have no other refuge than their
husbands. But it will never do to communicate our intention to my
father, for he would not let us go. So we must depart without that
hot-tempered father of mine knowing of it. And if he hears from the
attendants and comes after us, I will bewilder him by my knowledge, for
he is senseless and like an idiot.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of
hers, he set out delighted on the next day, with her who gave him the
half of her kingdom, and filled a casket with priceless jewels, and
brought that golden arrow; and they both mounted her splendid horse
&#346;aravega,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8821src" href="#xd27e8821"
name="xd27e8821src">11</a> having deceived the attendants by
representing that they were going for a pleasure excursion in the park,
and journeyed towards Vardham&aacute;na.</p>
<p>When the couple had gone a long distance, the R&aacute;kshasa
Agni&#347;ikha found it out, and in wrath pursued after them through
the air. And hearing afar off the noise produced by the speed of his
flight, R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; said to &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja on
the road, &ldquo;My husband, my father has come to make us turn back,
so remain here without fear: see how I will deceive him. For he shall
neither see you nor the horse, since I shall conceal both by my
deluding power.&rdquo; After saying this, she got down from the horse
and assumed by her deluding power the form of a man.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e8828src" href="#xd27e8828" name="xd27e8828src">12</a> And she
said to a woodcutter, who had come to the forest to cut
wood&mdash;&ldquo;A great R&aacute;kshasa <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>is coming here, so
remain quiet for a moment.&rdquo; Then she continued to cut wood with
his axe. And &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja looked on with a smile on his face.
In the meanwhile that foolish R&aacute;kshasa arrived there, and
lighted down from the air, on beholding his daughter in the shape of a
woodcutter, and asked her whether she had seen a man and woman pass
that way.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8836src" href="#xd27e8836" name=
"xd27e8836src">13</a> Then his daughter, who had assumed the form of a
man, said with great effort as if tired, &ldquo;We two have not seen
any couple, as our eyes are fatigued with toil, for we two woodcutters
have been occupied here in cutting a great quantity of wood to burn
Agni&#347;ikha the king of the R&aacute;kshasas, who is dead.&rdquo;
When that silly R&aacute;kshasa heard that, he thought, &ldquo;What! am
I dead? What then does that daughter matter to me? I will go and ask my
own attendants at home whether I am dead or not.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8842src" href="#xd27e8842" name=
"xd27e8842src">14</a> Thus reflecting, Agni&#347;ikha went quickly
home, and his daughter set out with her husband as before, laughing as
she went.</p>
<p>And soon the R&aacute;kshasa returned in high spirits, for he had
asked his attendants, who could not help laughing in their sleeves,
whether he was alive, and had learned that he was. Then
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, knowing from the terrible noise that he
was coming again, though as yet far off, got down from the horse and
concealed her husband as before by her deluding power, and taking
letters from the hand of a letter-carrier, who was coming along the
road, she again assumed the form of a man.</p>
<p>And so the R&aacute;kshasa arrived as before, and asked his
daughter, who was disguised as a man&mdash;&ldquo;Did you see a man and
a woman on the road?&rdquo; Then she, disguised as a man, answered him
with a sigh,&mdash;&ldquo;I beheld no such person, for my mind was
absorbed with my haste, for Agni&#347;ikha, who was to-day mortally
wounded in battle, and has only a little breath left in his body, and
is in his capital desiring to make over his kingdom, has despatched me
as a messenger to summon to his presence his brother
Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha, who is living an independent life.&rdquo; When
Agni&#347;ikha heard that, he said, &ldquo;What! am I mortally wounded
by my enemies?&rdquo; And in his perplexity he returned again home to
get information on the point. But it never occurred to him to say to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Who is mortally wounded? Here I am safe and
sound.&rdquo; Strange are the fools that the Creator produces, and
wonderfully obscured with the quality of darkness! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>And
when he arrived at home and found that the tale was false, he would not
expose himself again to the laughter of the people, tired of being
imposed upon, and forgetting his daughter. And
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, after deluding him, returned to her
husband as before, for virtuous women know of no other good than the
good of their husbands. Then &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, mounted on the
wonderful horse, again proceeded rapidly with his wife towards the city
of Vardham&aacute;na. Then his father V&iacute;rabhuja, having heard
that he was returning in company with her, went out much pleased to
meet him. The king, when he saw him adorned with that wife, like
<span class="corr" id="xd27e8870" title=
"Source: Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</span> with
Bh&aacute;m&aacute;, considered that he had gained afresh the bliss of
sovereign sway. And when his son got down from his horse, and clung to
his feet with his beloved, he raised him up and embraced him, and with
his eye, in which stood the water of joyful tears, performed in noble
wise the auspicious ceremony that put an end to his own despondency,
and then conducted him into his palace, making high festival. And when
he asked his son where he had been, &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja told him his
whole history from the beginning. And after summoning his brothers,
Nirv&aacute;sabhuja and all, into his father&rsquo;s presence, he gave
them the golden arrow. Then the king V&iacute;rabhuja, after what he
had heard and seen, was displeased with those other sons, and
considered &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja his only true son.</p>
<p>Then that wise king drew this true conclusion&mdash;&ldquo;I suspect
that, as this son of mine out of spite was banished by these enemies,
brothers only in name, though he was all the while innocent, so his
mother Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, whom I love so well, was falsely accused
by their mothers, and was all the while innocent. So what is the use of
delay? I will find out the truth of it immediately.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8875src" href="#xd27e8875" name=
"xd27e8875src">15</a> After these reflections, the king spent that day
in performing his duties, and went at night to sift his other wife
Aya&#347;olekh&aacute;. She was delighted to see him, and he made her
drink a great quantity of wine, and she in her sleep murmured out,
while the king was awake&mdash;&ldquo;If we had not falsely slandered
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, would the king ever have visited me
here?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8881src" href="#xd27e8881"
name="xd27e8881src">16</a> When the king heard this speech of the
wicked queen uttered in her sleep, he felt he had attained certainty,
and rose up in wrath and went out; and going to his own chamber, he had
the eunuchs summoned, and said to them; &ldquo;Take that
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; out of the dungeon, and after she has bathed
bring her quickly; for the present moment was appointed by the
astrologer as the limit of her stay in the dungeon for the purpose of
averting the evil omens.&rdquo; When they heard that, they said,
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and they went and quickly brought the queen
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; into the presence of the king, bathed and
adorned. Then that wedded pair, happy in having crossed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>sea of separation, spent that night unsated with
mutual embraces. Then the king related to the queen with delight that
adventure of &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja&rsquo;s, and told his son the
circumstances of his mother&rsquo;s imprisonment and release. In the
meanwhile Aya&#347;olekh&aacute;, waking up, found out that the king
was gone, and guessing that he had entrapped her with his conversation,
fell into deep despondency. And in the morning the king
V&iacute;rabhuja conducted his son &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, with his
wife R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, into the presence of
Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;. He came, and was delighted to behold his mother
emerged from the dungeon, and with his new wife he worshipped the feet
of his parents. Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, embracing her son, who had
returned from his journey, and her daughter-in-law, obtained in the way
above related, went from joy to joy. Then by the order of his father,
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja related to her at length his own adventure, and
what R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; did. Then queen Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;
delighted, said to him, &ldquo;My son, what has not that
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; done for you? For she, a heroine of
wonderful exploits, has given up and sacrificed for you her life, her
family, her native land, these three. She must be some goddess, become
incarnate for your sake by the appointment of Destiny. For she has
placed her foot on the head of all women that are devoted to their
husbands.&rdquo; When the queen had said this, the king applauded her
speech, and so did R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; with head modestly
bent. Just at that moment the superintendent of the womens&rsquo;
apartments, Surakshita, who had been long ago slandered by that
Aya&#347;olekh&aacute;, returned from visiting all the holy bathing
places. He was announced by the door-keeper, and bowed delighted at the
king&rsquo;s foot, and then the king, who now knew the facts, honoured
him exceedingly. And by his mouth he summoned the other queens who were
wicked, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Go! fling all these into the
dungeon.&rdquo; When the queen Gu&#7751;avar&aacute; heard that, and
the terrified women were thrown into the dungeon, she said out of
compassion to the king, clinging to his feet, &ldquo;King, do not keep
them for a long time in the dungeon! Have mercy, for I cannot bear to
see them terrified.&rdquo; By thus entreating the king she prevented
their imprisonment, for the only vengeance that the great make use of
against their enemies is compassion. Then those queens, dismissed by
the king, went ashamed to their houses, and would even have preferred
to have been in the embrace of death. And the king thought highly of
the great-hearted Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, and considered, because he
possessed that wife, that he must have accomplished virtuous acts in a
former state of existence. Then the king, determining to banish his
other sons by an artifice, had them summoned, and spake to them this
feigned speech&mdash;&ldquo;I have heard that you villains have slain a
Br&aacute;hman traveller, so go and visit all the holy bathing-places
in succession, do not remain here.&rdquo; When the sons heard that,
they were not able to persuade the king of the truth, for when a ruler
is bent on violence, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>can convince him? Then
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, beholding those brothers departing, with his
eyes full of tears produced by pity, thus addressed his father.
&ldquo;Father, pity their one fault, have mercy upon them.&rdquo;
Having said this, he fell at the feet of that king. And the king,
thinking that that son was able to bear the burden of sovereignty,
being even in his youth like an incarnation of Vish&#7751;u, full of
glory and compassion, hiding his real sentiments and cherishing his
anger against them, nevertheless did what &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja asked.
And all those brothers considered their younger brother as the saviour
of their lives. And all the subjects, beholding the exceeding virtue of
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, became attached to him.</p>
<p>Then the next day, his father, king V&iacute;rabhuja, anointed as
crown-prince &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, who was the oldest in virtue of
them all, though he had elder brothers. And then
&#346;&#7771;ingabhuja, having been anointed and having obtained the
leave of his father, went with all his forces to conquer the world. And
having brought back the wealth of numerous kings, whom he overcame by
the might of his arm, he returned, having diffused the splendour of his
glory through all the earth. Then bearing the weight of the realm with
his submissive brothers, the successful prince &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja,
giving pleasure to his parents, who remained in the enjoyment of
comfort free from anxiety, and bestowing gifts on Br&aacute;hmans,
dwelt at ease with R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute; as if with incarnate
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus virtuous women serve their husbands in every way,
devoted to them alone, like Gu&#7751;avar&aacute;, and
R&uacute;pa&#347;ikh&aacute;, the mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta, in the society of Ratnaprabh&aacute;,
heard this story from the lips of Hari&#347;ikha, he was much delighted
and exclaimed, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Then he rose up, and quickly
performed the religious ceremony for the day, and went with his wife
into the presence of his father, the king of Vatsa, and after eating,
and whiling away the afternoon with singing and playing, he spent the
night with his beloved in his own private apartments.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a Norwegian tale, called &ldquo;The Widow&rsquo;s
Son,&rdquo; page 295 of Thorpe&rsquo;s Yule-Tide Stories, will be found
an incident closely resembling the pursuit of &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja by
Dh&uacute;ma&#347;ikha. The widow&rsquo;s son has, contrary to the
orders of a Troll, in whose house he found himself, entered several
chambers, in one of which he found a thorn-whip, in another a huge
stone, and a water-bottle. In the third he found a boiling copper
kettle, with which he scalded his finger, but the Troll cured it with a
pot of ointment. In the fourth room he found a black horse in a stall,
with a trough of burning embers at its head, and a basket of hay at its
tail. The youth thought this cruel, so he changed their position. The
horse, to reward him, informed him that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>Troll on his return would certainly kill him,
and then continued, &ldquo;Lay the saddle on me, put on the armour, and
take the whip of thorn, the stone, and the water-flask and the pot of
ointment, and then we will set out.&rdquo; When the youth mounted the
horse, it set off at a rapid rate. After riding some time, the horse
said&mdash;&ldquo;I think I hear a noise; look round, can you see
anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;A great many are coming after us, certainly a
score at least,&rdquo; answered the youth. &ldquo;Ah! that is the
Troll,&rdquo; said the horse, <span class="corr" id="xd27e8904" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>he is coming with all his
companions.&rdquo; They travelled for a time until their pursuers were
gaining on them. &ldquo;Throw now the thorn whip over your
shoulder,&rdquo; said the horse,&mdash;&ldquo;but throw it far away
from me.&rdquo; The youth did so, and at the same moment there sprang
up a large thick wood of briars. The youth now rode on a long way,
while the Troll had to go home to fetch something wherewith to hew a
road through the wood. After some time the horse again said,
&ldquo;Look back, can you see anything now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, a whole
multitude of people&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;like a church
congregation.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is the Troll, now he has got more with
him, throw out now the large stone, but throw it far from me.&rdquo;
When the youth had done what the horse desired, there arose a large
stone mountain behind them. So the Troll was obliged to go home after
something with which to bore through the mountain; and while he was
thus employed, the youth rode on a considerable way. But now the horse
bade him again look back; he then saw a multitude like a whole army,
they were so bright, that they glittered in the sun. &ldquo;Well that
is the Troll with all his friends,&rdquo; said the horse. &ldquo;Now
throw the water-bottle behind you, but take good care to spill none on
me.&rdquo; The youth did so, but notwithstanding his caution he
happened to spill a drop on the horse&rsquo;s loins. Immediately there
arose a vast lake, and the spilling of a few drops caused the horse to
stand far out in the water; nevertheless he at last swam to the shore.
When the Trolls came to the water, they lay down to drink it all up,
and they gulped and gulped it down till they burst. (Folk-lore demons
experience great difficulty in crossing water.) &ldquo;Now we are quit
of them,&rdquo; said the horse.</p>
<p>In Laura von Gonzenbach&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Sicilianische
M&auml;rchen</span>, Vol. II, p. 57, we find a similar incident. In the
story of Fata Morgana, a prince, who carries off a bottle filled with
her perspiration, but imprudently wakes her by kissing her, is pursued
by her with two lions. He throws three pomegranates behind him: the
first produces a river of blood, the second a thorny mountain, the
third a volcano. This he does by the advice of his horse, who is really
Fata Morgana&rsquo;s brother transformed by magic: see also Vol. I, p.
343; cp. also the 79th tale in Grimm&rsquo;s <span lang=
"de">Kinder<span class="corr" id="xd27e8914" title=
"Not in source">-</span> und Hausm&auml;rchen</span> (sixteenth edition
in one volume) <i lang="de">Die Wassernixe</i>.</p>
<p>In <span lang="de">Orient und Occident</span>, Vol. II, p. 113, Dr.
Reinhold K&ouml;hler, in his remarks on the West Highland Stories
collected by J. F. Campbell, compares the story of Agni&#347;ikha with
the second story in Campbell&rsquo;s collection, entitled: &ldquo;The
Battle of the Birds.&rdquo; In this a king&rsquo;s son wishes to marry
the youngest daughter of a giant. The giant sets him three tasks to do;
to clean out a stable, to thatch it with feathers, and to fetch eggs
from a magpie&rsquo;s nest in the top of a tree more than five hundred
feet high. All these tasks he accomplishes by the help of the young
lady herself. In the last task she makes a ladder of her fingers for
him to ascend the tree by, but in so doing she loses her little finger.
The giant requires the prince to choose his wife from among three
sisters similarly dressed. He recognizes her by the loss of the little
finger. When bed-time came, the giant&rsquo;s daughter told the prince
that they must fly, or the giant would kill him. They mounted on the
gray filly in the stable. But before starting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>the
daughter cut an apple into nine shares; she put two at the head of the
bed, two at the foot, two at the door of the kitchen, two at the
house-door, and one outside the house. The giant awoke and called
&ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; several times, and the shares answered
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; At last he went and found the bed empty and cold, and
pursued the fugitive couple. At the break of day the giant&rsquo;s
daughter felt her father&rsquo;s breath burning her back. She told the
prince to put his hand in the horse&rsquo;s ear, and fling what he
found behind him. He found a sprig of sloe, flung it behind him, and
produced a wood twenty miles long. The giant had to go back for his axe
and wood-knife. In the middle of the day the prince finds in the ear of
the filly a piece of gray stone. This produces twenty miles of gray
rock behind them. The giant has to go back for his lever and mattock.
The next thing, that the prince finds and flings behind him, is a
bladder of water. This produces a fresh-water loch twenty miles broad.
In it the giant is happily drowned. The rest of the story has no
bearing upon the tale of &#346;&#7771;ingabhuja. K&ouml;hler compares a
story in William Carleton&rsquo;s stories of the Irish peasantry. Here
there is a sprig, a pebble and a drop of water producing a wood, a rock
and a lake. He compares also a Norwegian story, Ashbj&ouml;rnsen, No.
46, and some Swedish stories collected by Hylten Cavallius and G.
Stephens. The three tasks are very different in the different forms of
the tale. The ladder of fingers is only found <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e8928" title="Source: is">in</span> the Celtic form.</p>
<p>It is only in the Gaelic and Irish forms that the objects thrown
behind to check pursuit are found in the ear of the horse.</p>
<p>In the latter form of the story of the Mermaid, Thorpe&rsquo;s
Yule-Tide Stories, p. 205, we have the pursuit with much the same
incidents as in our text. See also Ralston&rsquo;s remarks on the story
in our text at pp. 132 and 143 of his Russian Folk-Tales. Cp. also
Veckenstedt&rsquo;s Wendische Sagen, p. 216. An Indian parallel will be
found in Miss Frere&rsquo;s Old Deccan Days, pp. 62 and 63. A Modern
Greek one in Bernhard Schmidt&rsquo;s <span lang="de">Griechische
M&auml;rchen</span>, pp. 76&ndash;79.</p>
<p>Cp. also for the tasks the story of Bisara in Kaden&rsquo;s
<span lang="de">Unter den Olivenb&auml;umen</span>, and that of
<span lang="de">Die sch&ouml;ne Fiorita</span>. Herr Kaden aptly
compares the story of Jason and Medea. Another excellent parallel is
furnished by the story of Schneeweiss-Feuerroth in the same collection,
where we have the pursuit much as in our text.</p>
<p>The pursuit and the tasks are found in the tale called La Montagne
Noire, on p. 448 of Melusine, a periodical which appeared in the year
1878, and in Branca-flor, No. XIV in Coelho&rsquo;s <span lang=

<span lang="de">M&auml;rchen der Magyaren</span>, p. 60. The tasks are

<p class="first">Then, the next morning, when Narav&aacute;hanadatta
was in Ratnaprabh&aacute;&rsquo;s house, Gomukha and the others came to
him. But Marubh&uacute;ti, being a little sluggish with intoxication
produced by drinking spirits, approached slowly, decorated with
flowers, and anointed with unguents. Then Gomukha, with face amused at
his novel conception of statesman-like behaviour, out of fun ridiculed
him by imitating his stammering utterance and staggering gait, and said
to him, &ldquo;How comes it that you, though the son of
Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a, do not know policy, that you drink
spirits in the morning, and come drunk into the presence of the
prince?<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the

&ldquo;This should be said to me by the prince or some superior. But,
tell me, who are you that you take upon you to instruct me, you son of
Ityaka?&rdquo; When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370"
name="pb370">370</a>]</span>he said this, Gomukha replied to him
smiling, &ldquo;Do princes reprove with their own mouths an ill-behaved
servant? Undoubtedly their attendants must remind him of what is
proper. And it is true that I am the son of Ityaka, but you are an ox
of ministers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8980src" href="#xd27e8980"
name="xd27e8980src">1</a> your sluggishness alone would show it; the
only fault is that you have no horns.&rdquo; When Gomukha said this to
him Marubh&uacute;ti answered, &ldquo;You too, Gomukha, have much of
the ox-nature about you; but you are clearly of mixed breed, for you
are not properly domesticated.&rdquo; When all laughed at hearing this,
Gomukha said, &ldquo;This Marubh&uacute;ti is literally a jewel, for
who can introduce the thread of virtue<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Story of Tapodatta.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na a
Br&aacute;hman of the name of Tapodatta. He, though his father kept
worrying him, would not learn the sciences in his boyhood. Subsequently
he found himself censured by all, and being filled with regret, he went
to the bank of the Ganges, in order to perform asceticism for the
acquisition of knowledge.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8998src" href=
"#xd27e8998" name="xd27e8998src">3</a> There he betook himself to
severe mortification of the flesh, and while he was thus engaged,
Indra, who had beheld him with astonishment, came to him to prevent
him, disguised as a Br&aacute;hman. And when he had come near him, he
kept taking grains of sand from the bank, and throwing them into the
billowy water of the Ganges. When Tapodatta saw that, he broke his
silence, and asked him out of curiosity&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman,
why do you do this unceasingly?&rdquo; And Indra, disguised as a
Br&aacute;hman, when he had been persistently questioned by him, said,
&ldquo;I am making a bridge over the Ganges for man and beast to cross
by.&rdquo; Then Tapodatta said, &ldquo;You fool, is it possible to make
a bridge over the Ganges with sand, which will be carried away at some
future time by the current?&rdquo; When Indra, disguised as a
Br&aacute;hman, heard that, he said to him&mdash;&ldquo;If you know
this truth, why do you attempt to acquire knowledge by vows and
fasting, without reading or hearing lectures? The horn of a
hare<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9001src" href="#xd27e9001" name=
"xd27e9001src">4</a> may really exist, and the sky may be adorned with
painting, and writing may be performed without letters, if learning may
be acquired without study. If it could be so acquired, no one in this
world would study at all.&rdquo; When Indra, disguised as a
Br&aacute;hman, had said this to Tapodatta, Tapodatta reflected, and
thinking that he had spoken truth, put a stop to his
self-mortification, and went home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371"

<p>&ldquo;So, you see, a wise man is easily made to listen to reason,
but the foolish Marubh&uacute;ti cannot be induced to listen to reason,
but when you admonish him, he flies into a passion.&rdquo; When Gomukha
said this, Hari&#347;ikha said before the company&mdash;&ldquo;It is
true, O king, that the wise are easily induced to listen to
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Vir&uacute;pa&#347;arman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For instance, there lived of old time in Benares a
certain excellent Br&aacute;hman, named Vir&uacute;pa&#347;arman, who
was deformed and poor. And he, being despondent about his misshapen
form and his poverty, went to the grove of ascetics there, and began to
practise severe mortification of the flesh, through desire for beauty
and wealth. Then the king of the gods<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9018src" href="#xd27e9018" name="xd27e9018src">5</a> assumed the
vile shape of a deformed jackal with a diseased body, and went and
stood in front of him. When he saw that unfortunate<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9026src" href="#xd27e9026" name="xd27e9026src">6</a> creature
with its body covered with flies, Vir&uacute;pa&#347;arman slowly
reflected in his mind,&mdash;&ldquo;Such creatures are born into the
world on account of actions done in a former life, so is it a small
thing for me that I was not made thus by the Creator? Who can overstep
the lot prescribed by destiny?&rdquo; When Vir&uacute;pa&#347;arman
perceived this, he brought his self-mortification to an end and went
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So true is it, O king, that a wise man is instructed with
little effort, but one, whose mind is void of discernment, is not
instructed even with great exertion.&rdquo; Thus spoke Hari&#347;ikha,
and Gomukha assented, but Marubh&uacute;ti, who was drunk and did not
understand a joke, said in great anger, &ldquo;There is power in the
speech of Gomukha, but there is no might in the arms of men like you. A
garrulous, quarrelsome, effeminate person makes heroes blush.&rdquo;
When Marubh&uacute;ti said this, being eager for a fight, king
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with a smile on his face, himself tried to
appease him, and after dismissing him to his house, the king, who loved
the friends of his youth, performed the duties of the day, and so spent
it in great comfort. And the next day, when all these ministers came,
and among them Marubh&uacute;ti bowed down with shame, his beloved
Ratnaprabh&aacute; spake thus to the prince: &ldquo;You, my husband,
are very fortunate in that you have these pure-hearted ministers bound
to you by the fetters of a love dating from early childhood, and they
are happy in possessing such an affectionate master; you have been
gained by one another through actions in a former state of existence;
of that there can be no doubt.&rdquo; When the queen said this,
Tapantaka the son of Vasantaka, the companion in amusements of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, remarked&mdash;&ldquo;It is true; our master
has been gained by our actions in a former life. For every thing
depends upon the power of actions in a former life&mdash;Hear in
illustration of it the following tale.&rdquo; <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of king Vil&aacute;sa&#347;&iacute;la and the
physician Taru&#7751;achandra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There dwelt in a city named Vil&aacute;sapura, the
home of &#346;iva, a king rightly named
Vil&aacute;sa&#347;&iacute;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9038src"
href="#xd27e9038" name="xd27e9038src">7</a> He had a queen named
Kamalaprabh&aacute;, whom he valued as his life, and he long remained
with her addicted to pleasure only. Then in course of time there came
upon the king old age, the thief of beauty, and when he beheld it, he
was sorely grieved. He thought to himself&mdash;&ldquo;How can I shew
to the queen my face marred with grey hairs like a snow-smitten lotus?
Alas! it is better that I should die.&rdquo; Busied with reflections
like these, the king summoned into his hall of audience a physician
named Taru&#7751;achandra<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9043src" href=
"#xd27e9043" name="xd27e9043src">8</a> and thus spake to him
respectfully&mdash;&ldquo;My good man, because you are clever and
devoted to me, I ask you whether there is any artifice by which this
old age can be averted.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When Taru&#7751;achandra, who was
rightly named as being only of the magnitude of one digit, and desiring
to become a full moon, heard that, the cunning fellow
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I must make my profit out of this blockhead of a
king, and I shall soon discover the means of doing it.&rdquo; Having
thus reflected, the physician said to the king: &ldquo;If you will
remain in an underground chamber alone, O king, for eight months, and
take this medicine, I engage to remove your old age.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9051src" href="#xd27e9051" name="xd27e9051src">9</a>
When the king heard this, he had such an underground chamber prepared,
for fools intent on objects of sense cannot endure reflection. But the
ministers used arguments like the following with him&mdash;&ldquo;O
king, by the goodness and asceticism and self-denial of men of old
time, and by the virtue of the age, elixirs were produced. But these
forest remedies,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9054src" href="#xd27e9054"
name="xd27e9054src">10</a> which we hear of now, O king, owing to the
want of proper materials, produce the opposite effect to that which is
intended, and this is quite in accordance with the treatises; for
rogues do in this way make sport with fools. Does time past ever
return, O king?&rdquo;&mdash;Still these arguments did not penetrate
into his soul, for it was encased in the thick armour of violent
sensual desire. And in accordance with the advice of that physician, he
entered that underground chamber alone, excluding the numerous retinue
that usually waits upon a king. And alone with one servant belonging to
that physician, he made himself a slave to the taking of drugs and the
rest of the treatment. And the king remained there in that dark
subterranean den, which seemed as if it were the overflowing, through
abundance, of the ignorance of his heart. And after the king had spent
six months in that underground chamber, that wicked physician, seeing
that his senility had increased, brought a certain young <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>man
who resembled him in appearance, with whom he had agreed that he would
make him king. Then he dug a tunnel into that underground chamber from
a distance, and after killing the king in his sleep, he brought his
corpse out by the underground passage, and threw it into a dark well.
All this was done at night. And by the same tunnel he introduced that
young man into the underground chamber, and closed that tunnel. What
audacious wickedness will not a low fellow, who is held in check by no
restraints, commit, when he gets a favourable chance of practising upon
fools? Then, the next day, the physician said to all the
subjects,&mdash;&ldquo;This king has been made young again by me in six
months, and in two months his form will be changed again&mdash;So show
yourselves to him now at a little distance.&rdquo; Thus he spake, and
brought them all to the door of the underground chamber, and shewed
them to the young man, telling him at the same time their names and
occupations. By this artifice he kept instructing that young man in the
underground chamber in the names of all the subjects every day for two
months, not excepting even the inhabitants of the harem.</p>
<p>And when a fitting time came, he brought the young man, after he had
been well fed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9065src" href="#xd27e9065"
name="xd27e9065src">11</a> out of the subterranean chamber, saying,
&ldquo;This king has become young again.&rdquo; And then the young man
was surrounded by the delighted subjects, who exclaimed &ldquo;This is
our own king restored by drugs.&rdquo; Then the young man, having thus
obtained the kingdom, bathed, and performed with much pleasure by the
help of his ministers the kingly duties. And from that time forth he
lived in much felicity, transacting regal business, and sporting with
the ladies of the harem, having obtained the name of Ajara.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9073src" href="#xd27e9073" name=
"xd27e9073src">12</a> And all the subjects considered that he was their
former king transformed by drugs, not guessing the truth, and not
suspecting the proceedings of the physician. And king Ajara, having
gained over the subjects and the queen Kamalaprabh&aacute; by kind
treatment, enjoyed the royal fortune together with his friends. Then he
summoned a friend called Bheshajachandra and another called
Padmadar&#347;ana, and made both of them like himself, satisfying them
with gifts of elephants, horses, and villages. And he honoured the
physician Taru&#7751;achandra on account of the advancement he had
conferred on him, but he did not repose confidence in him because his
soul had fallen from truth and virtue.</p>
<p>And once on a time the physician of his own motion said to the king,
&ldquo;Why do you make me of no account and act independently? Have you
forgotten the occasion on which I made you king?&rdquo; When king
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>Ajara heard that, he said to the physician,
&ldquo;Ha! you are a fool: what man does anything for any one, or gives
anything to any one? My friend, it is our deeds in a former state of
existence that give and do. Therefore do not boast yourself, for this
elevation I attained by asceticism: and I will soon shew you this by
ocular proof.&rdquo; When he said this to the physician, the latter
reflected as one terrified&mdash;&ldquo;This man is not to be
intimidated and speaks like a resolute sage. It is better to overawe
that master, the secret of whose character is instability, but that
cannot be done with this man, so I must submit to him. In the meanwhile
let me wait and see what he will shew me so manifestly.&rdquo; Thus
reflecting, the physician said, &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; and held his
peace.</p>
<p>And the next day king Ajara went out to roam about and amuse himself
with his friends, waited on by Taru&#7751;achandra and others. And as
he was strolling, he reached the bank of a river, and in it he saw five
golden lotuses come floating down the current. And he made his servants
bring them, and taking them and looking at them, he said to the
physician Taru&#7751;achandra, who was standing near him, &ldquo;Go up
along the bank of this river, and look for the place where these
lotuses are produced: and when you have seen it, return, for I feel
great curiosity about these wonderful lotuses, and you are my skilful
friend.&rdquo; When he was thus commissioned by the king, the
physician, not being able to help himself, said, &ldquo;So be
it,&rdquo; and went the way he was ordered. And the king returned to
his capital, but the physician travelled on, and in course of time
reached a temple of &#346;iva that stood on the bank of that river. And
in front of it, on the shore of a holy bathing-place in that stream, he
beheld a great banyan-tree, and a man&rsquo;s skeleton suspended on it.
And while, fatigued with his journey, he was resting after bathing and
worshipping the god, a cloud came there and rained. And from that human
skeleton, hanging on the branches of the banyan-tree, when rained upon
by the cloud, there fell drops of water.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9084src" href="#xd27e9084" name="xd27e9084src">13</a> And when
they fell into the water of the bathing-place in that river, the
physician observed that those golden lotuses were immediately produced
from them. The physician said to himself, &ldquo;Ha! what is this
wonder? Whom can I ask in the uninhabited wood? Or rather who knows the
creation of Destiny that is full of so many marvels? I have beheld this
mine of golden lotuses; so I will throw this human skeleton into the
sacred water. Let right be done, and let golden lotuses grow from its
back.&rdquo; After these reflections, he flung the skeleton down from
the top of that tree: and after spending the day there, the physician
set out the next day for his own country, having accomplished the
object for which he was sent. And in a few days he reached
Vil&aacute;sapura, and went, emaciated and soiled with his journey, to
the court of king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375"
name="pb375">375</a>]</span>Ajara. The door-keeper announced him, and
he went in and prostrated himself at the feet of the king; the king
asked him how he was, and while he was relating his adventure, the king
put every one else out of the hall, and himself said; &ldquo;So you
have seen, my friend, the place where the golden lotuses are produced,
that most holy sanctuary of &#346;iva; and you saw there a skeleton on
a banyan-tree; know that that is my former body. I hung there in old
time by my feet; and in that way performed asceticism, until I dried up
my body and abandoned it. And owing to the nobility of my penance, from
the drops of rain-water, that fall from that skeleton of mine, are
produced golden lotuses. And in that you threw my skeleton into the
water of that holy bathing-place, you did what was right, for you were
my friend in a former birth. And this Bheshajachandra and this
Padmadar&#347;ana, they also were friends, who associated with me in a
former birth. So it is owing to the might of that asceticism, my
friend, that recollection of my former birth, and knowledge and empire
have been bestowed on me. By an artifice I have given you ocular proof
of this, and you have described it with a token, telling how you flung
down the skeleton; so you must not boast to me, saying, that you gave
me the kingdom, and you must not allow your mind to be discontented,
for no one gives anything to any one without the help of actions in a
former life. From his birth a man eats the fruit of the tree of his
former actions.&rdquo; When the king said this to the physician, he saw
that it was true, and he remained satisfied with the king&rsquo;s
service, and was never afterwards discontented. And that noble-minded
king Ajara, who remembered his former birth, honoured the physician
becomingly with gifts of wealth, and lived comfortably with his wives
and friends, enjoying the earth conquered by his policy, and originally
obtained by his good actions, without an opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus in this world all the good and bad fortune, that befalls
all men at all times, is earned by actions in a former life. For this
reason I think we must have earned you for our lord in a former birth,
otherwise how could you be so kind to us, while there are other men in
existence?&rdquo; Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having heard in the
company of his beloved from the mouth of Tapantaka this strangely
pleasing and entertaining tale, rose up to bathe. And after he had
bathed, he went into the presence of his father the king of Vatsa,
frequently raining nectar into the eyes of his mother, and after taking
food, he spent that day and that night in drinking and other pleasures
with his parents, and his wife, and his ministers. <span class=

<p class="first">And the next day, as Narav&aacute;hanadatta was in the
apartments of Ratnaprabh&aacute;, talking over various subjects with
his ministers, he suddenly heard a sound, which appeared to be like
that of a man weeping outside in the court-yard of the palace. And when
some one asked&mdash;&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;&mdash;the female
attendants came and said, &ldquo;My lord, the chamberlain Dharmagiri is
weeping here. For a foolish friend of his came here just now, and said
that his brother, who went on a pilgrimage to holy places, was dead in
a foreign land. He, bewildered with grief, forgot that he was in the
court and began to lament, but he has been just now taken outside by
the servants and conducted to his own house.&rdquo; When the prince
heard this, he was grieved, and Ratnaprabh&aacute; moved with pity said
in a despondent tone&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! the grief which is produced by
the loss of dear relatives is hard to bear! Why did not the Creator
make men exempt from old age and death?&rdquo; When Marubh&uacute;ti
heard this speech of the queen&rsquo;s, he said; &ldquo;Queen, how can
mortals ever attain this good fortune? For listen to the following
story, which I will tell you, bearing on this question.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Chir&aacute;yus and his minister
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Chir&aacute;yus there was in old time a
king, named Chir&aacute;yus,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9103src" href=
"#xd27e9103" name="xd27e9103src">1</a> who was indeed long-lived, and
the home of all good fortune. He had a compassionate, generous and
gifted minister, named N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, who was sprung from a
portion of a Bodhisattva, who knew the use of all drugs, and by making
an elixir he rendered himself and that king free from old age, and
long-lived. One day an infant son of that minister
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, whom he loved more than any of his other
children, died. He felt grief on that account, and by the force of his
asceticism and knowledge proceeded to prepare out of certain
ingredients the Water of Immortality,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9108src" href="#xd27e9108" name="xd27e9108src">2</a> in order to
prevent mortals from dying. But while he was waiting for the auspicious
moment in which to infuse a particular drug, Indra found out what was
going on. And Indra, having consulted with the gods, said to the two
A&#347;vins&mdash;&ldquo;Go and give this message to
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna on the earth from me&mdash;&lsquo;Why have you,
though a minister, begun this revolutionary proceeding of making the
Water of Life? Are you determined now to conquer the Creator, who
indeed created men subject to the law of death, since you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>propose to make men immortal by preparing the
Water of Life? If this takes place, what difference will there be
between gods and men? And the constitution of the universe will be
broken up, because there will be no sacrificer and no recipient of
sacrifice. So by my advice discontinue this preparation of the Water of
Life, otherwise the gods will be angry, and will certainly curse you.
And your son, through grief for whom you are engaged in this attempt,
is now in Svarga.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; With this message Indra
despatched the two A&#347;vins. And they arrived at the house of
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna and, after receiving the <i lang=

"#xd27e9129" name="xd27e9129src">3</a> told N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna,
who was pleased with their visit, the message of Indra, and informed
him that his son was with the gods in heaven. Then
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, being despondent, thought; &ldquo;Never mind
the gods, but if I do not obey the command of Indra, these A&#347;vins
will inflict a curse on me. So let this Water of Life go, I have not
accomplished my desire; however my son, on account of my good deeds in
a former life, has gone to the abode of bliss.&rdquo; Having thus
reflected, N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna said to these two gods, the
A&#347;vins, &ldquo;I obey the command of Indra, I will desist from
making the Water of Life. If you two had not come, I should have
completed the preparation of the Water of Life in five days, and freed
this whole earth from old age and death.&rdquo; When
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna had said this, he buried by their advice the
Water of Life, which was almost completed, in the earth before their
eyes. Then the A&#347;vins took leave of him, and went and told Indra
in heaven that their errand was accomplished, and the king of gods
rejoiced.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna&rsquo;s master, the
king Chir&aacute;yus, anointed his son J&iacute;vahara crown-prince.
And when he was anointed, his mother, the queen Dhanapar&aacute;, on
his coming in great delight to salute her, said to him, as soon as she
saw him, &ldquo;Why do you rejoice without cause, my son, at having
obtained this dignity of crown-prince, for this is not a step to the
attainment of the kingly dignity, not even by the help of asceticism?
For many crown-princes, sons of your father, have died, and not one of
them has obtained the throne, they have all inherited disappointment.
For N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna has given this king an elixir, by the help
of which he is now in the eighth century of his age. And who knows how
many more centuries will pass over the head of this king, who makes his
short-lived sons crown-princes.&rdquo; When her son heard that, he was
despondent, and she went on to say to him, &ldquo;If you desire the
throne, adopt this expedient. This minister N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna
every day, after he has performed the day&rsquo;s devotions, gives
gifts at the time of taking food, and makes this proclamation;
&lsquo;Who is a suppliant? Who wants anything? To whom can I give
anything, and what?&rsquo; At that moment go to him and say,
&lsquo;Give me your head,&rsquo;&mdash;Then he, being a truthful
man<span class="corr" id="xd27e9137" title="Source: .">,</span> will
have his head <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>cut off, and out of sorrow for his death this
king will die, or retire to the forest; then you will obtain the crown;
there is no other expedient available in this matter.&rdquo; When he
heard this speech from his mother, the prince was delighted, and he
consented, and determined to carry her advice into effect, for the lust
of sovereign sway is cruel, and overcomes one&rsquo;s affection for
one&rsquo;s friends. Then that prince went, the next day, of his own
accord to the house of that N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, at the time when
he took his food. And when the minister cried out, &ldquo;Who requires
anything, and what does he require?&rdquo; he entered and asked him for
his head. The minister said, &ldquo;This is strange, my son; what can
you do with this head of mine? For it is only an agglomeration of
flesh, bone and hair. To what use can you put it? Nevertheless, if it
is of any use to you, cut it off, and take it.&rdquo; With these words
he offered his neck to him. But it had been so hardened by the elixir
that, though he struck at it for a long time, he could not cut it, but
broke many swords over it. In the meanwhile the king, hearing of it,
arrived, and asked him not to give away his head, but
N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna said to him: &ldquo;I can remember my former
births, and I have given away my head ninety-nine times in my various
births. This, my lord, will be the hundredth time of my giving away my
head. So do not say anything against it, for no suppliant ever leaves
my presence disappointed. So I will now present your son with my head;
for this delay was made by me only in order to behold your face.&rdquo;
Thus he spoke, and embraced that king, and brought a powder out of his
closet, with which he smeared the sword of that prince. Then the prince
cut off the head of the minister N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna with a blow of
that sword, as a man cuts a lotus from its stalk. Then a great cry of
wailing was raised, and the king was on the point of giving up his own
life, when a bodiless voice sounded from the heaven in these
words&mdash;&ldquo;Do not do what you ought not, king. You should not
lament your friend N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna, for he will not be born
again, but has attained the condition of a Buddha.&rdquo; When king
Chir&aacute;yus heard this, he gave up the idea of suicide, but
bestowed great gifts, and out of grief left his throne, and went to the
forest. There in time he obtained by asceticism eternal bliss. Then his
son J&iacute;vahara obtained his kingdom, and soon after his accession
he allowed dissension to arise in his realm, and was slain by the sons
of N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna remembering their father&rsquo;s murder.
Then through sorrow for him his mother&rsquo;s heart broke. How can
prosperity befall those who walk in the path trodden by the ignoble?
And a son of that king Chir&aacute;yus, born to him by another wife,
named &#346;at&aacute;yus, was placed on his throne by his chief
ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, as the gods would not permit N&aacute;g&aacute;rjuna to
carry out the task of destroying death, which he had undertaken, he
became subject to death. Therefore it is true that this world of living
beings was appointed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href=
"#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>Creator unstable, and full of
grief hard to ward off, and even with hundreds of efforts it is
impossible for any one to do anything here, which the Creator does not
wish him to do.&rdquo; When Marubh&uacute;ti had told this story, he
ceased speaking, and Narav&aacute;hanadatta rose up with his ministers
and performed his daily duties.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then, early the next day, Narav&aacute;hanadatta went
off to the forest for the purpose of hunting, surrounded with
elephants, in the company of his father and his friends; but before
going he comforted his beloved Ratnaprabh&aacute;, who was anxious
about him, by saying that he would quickly return.</p>
<p>Then the scene of the chase became like a garden adorned with lovely
creepers for his delight, for in it the pearls that dropped from the
claws of the lions, that had cleft the foreheads of elephants, and now
fell asleep in death, were sown like seeds; and the teeth of the tigers
that were cut out by the crescent-headed arrows were like buds, and the
flowing blood of the deer seemed like shoots, and the wild boars, in
which stuck the arrows adorned with heron feathers, seemed like
clusters, and the fallen bodies of &#346;arabhas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9153src" href="#xd27e9153" name="xd27e9153src">1</a> shewed like
fruit, and the arrows falling with deep hum appeared like bees.
Gradually the prince became wearied, and desisted from the chase, and
went on horseback to another wood with Gomukha, who was also riding.
There he began to play at ball, and while he was thus engaged, a
certain female ascetic came that way. Then the ball slipped from his
hand and fell on her head; whereupon the female ascetic laughed a
little, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;If your insolence is so great now,
what will it be if you ever obtain Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; for a
wife.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9156src" href="#xd27e9156"
name="xd27e9156src">2</a> When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this, he
dismounted from his horse, and prostrating himself at the feet of that
female ascetic, said to her&mdash;&ldquo;I did not see you, and my ball
fell on your head by chance&mdash;Reverend one, be propitiated, and
pardon that fault of mine.&rdquo; When the female ascetic heard that,
she said, &ldquo;My son, I am not angry with you,&rdquo; and being
victorious over her wrath she comforted him with blessings. And then,
thinking that the wise truthful ascetic was well disposed to him,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta respectfully asked her&mdash;&ldquo;Who,
reverend lady, is this Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; spoken of by you?
Condescend to inform me, if you are pleased with me, for I am curious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>on this head.&rdquo; When he said this, bending
before her, the female ascetic said to him: &ldquo;There is on the
other side of the sea a city named Karp&uacute;rasambhava;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9164src" href="#xd27e9164" name="xd27e9164src">3</a>
in it there is a king rightly named Karp&uacute;raka, he has a
daughter, a lovely maiden, named Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, who appears
like a second Lakshm&iacute;, deposited in security there by the ocean,
having seen that the first Lakshm&iacute; had been carried away by the
gods after the churning. And she, as she hates men, does not desire to
be married, but she will desire it, if at all, when she sees you. So go
there, my son, and you shall win that fair one; nevertheless, while you
are going there, you will suffer great hardship in the forest. But you
must not be perplexed at that, for all shall end well.&rdquo; When the
ascetic had said this, she flew up into the air and disappeared. Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, drawn on by the command of Love uttered through
her voice, said to his attendant Gomukha, &ldquo;Come, let us go to
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; in the city of Karp&uacute;rasambhava, for I
cannot remain a moment without beholding her.&rdquo; When Gomukha heard
that, he said&mdash;&ldquo;King, desist from your rashness. Consider
how far off you are from the sea and from that city, and whether the
journey is worth taking for the sake of that maiden? Why, on merely
hearing her name, do you abandon celestial wives, and alone run after a
mere woman who is enveloped in doubt, owing to your not knowing what
her intention is.&rdquo; When Gomukha said this to him, the son of the
king of Vatsa said, &ldquo;The speech of that holy ascetic cannot be
false. So I must certainly go to find that princess.&rdquo; Having said
this, he set out thence on horseback that very moment. And Gomukha
followed him silently, though it was against his wish: when a lord does
not act on the advice of his servants, their only course is to follow
him.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the king of Vatsa, having finished his hunting,
returned to his city, thinking that that son of his was returning among
his own armed followers. And the prince&rsquo;s followers returned with
Marubh&uacute;ti and the others to the city, supposing that the prince
was with the armed followers of his father. When they arrived, the king
of Vatsa and the others searched for him, and finding that he had not
returned, they all went to the house of Ratnaprabh&aacute;. She at
first was grieved at that news, but she called up a supernatural
science and was told by it tidings of her husband, and said to her
distressed father-in-law; &ldquo;My husband heard the princess
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; mentioned by a female ascetic in the forest,
and in order to obtain her he has gone to the city of
Karp&uacute;rasambhava. And he will soon have accomplished his object,
and will return here with Gomukha. So dismiss anxiety, for this I have
learned from a science.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> By these words she comforted the king of
Vatsa and his retinue.<a id="xd27e9174" name="xd27e9174"></a> And she
despatched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>another science to wait on her husband during
his journey, and dispel his fatigue; for good women who desire their
husband&rsquo;s happiness do not account of jealousy.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Narav&aacute;hanadatta performed a long journey on
horseback in that forest, accompanied by Gomukha. Then a maiden
suddenly came up to him in his path and said to him, &ldquo;I am a
science sent by Ratnaprabh&aacute;, named
M&aacute;y&aacute;vat&iacute;, I will guard you on the path without
being seen, so proceed now without fear.&rdquo; Having said this, the
incarnate science disappeared, as he gazed at it. By virtue of it,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta continued his journey with his thirst and hunger
appeased, praising his beloved Ratnaprabh&aacute;. And in the evening
he reached a wood with a pure lake in it, and with Gomukha he bathed,
and took a meal of delicious fruit and water. And at night he tied up
the two horses underneath a large tree, after supplying them with
grass, and he and his minister climbed up into it to sleep. While
reposing on a broad bough of the tree, he was woke up by the neighings
of the terrified horses, and saw a lion that had come close underneath.
When he saw it, he wished<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9180src" href=
"#xd27e9180" name="xd27e9180src">4</a> to get down for the sake of the
horses, but Gomukha said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! you are neglecting
the safety of your person, and acting without counsel; for kings the
first duty is the preservation of their persons, and counsel is the
foundation of rule. How can you desire to contend with wild beasts
armed with teeth and claws. For it was to avoid these that we just now
got up into this tree.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the king had been restrained from
descending by these words of Gomukha&rsquo;s, seeing the lion killing
the horse, he immediately threw his sword at it from the tree, and
succeeded in wounding it with the weapon which was buried in its body.
The mighty lion, though pierced with the sword, after killing that
horse, slew the other also. Then the son of the king of Vatsa took
Gomukha&rsquo;s sword from him, and throwing it, cut the lion in half
in the middle. And descending he recovered his sword from the body of
the lion, and ascending again to his sleeping place, he passed the
night there in the tree. In the morning Narav&aacute;hanadatta got
down, and set out to find Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, accompanied by
Gomukha. Then Gomukha, beholding him travelling on foot, as the lion
had slain his horse, in order to amuse him on the way said;
&ldquo;Listen, king, I will relate you this story, which is
particularly appropriate on the present occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of king Parity&aacute;gasena, his wicked wife
and his two sons.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in this world a city named
Ir&aacute;vat&iacute;, which surpasses Alak&aacute;;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9194src" href="#xd27e9194" name="xd27e9194src">5</a> in it
there dwelt a king named Parity&aacute;gasena. And he had two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>beloved queens, whom he valued as his life. One
was the daughter of his own minister and her name was <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e9199" title=
"Source: Adikhasangam&aacute;">Adhikasangam&aacute;</span>, and the
other was of royal race, and was called
K&aacute;vy&aacute;lank&aacute;r&aacute;. And with those two the king
propitiated Durg&aacute; to obtain a son, and performed penance without
food, sleeping on <i>darbha</i> grass. Then Bhav&aacute;n&iacute;, who
is kind to her votaries, pleased with his penance, appeared to him in a
dream and gave him two heavenly fruits, and thus commanded him:
&ldquo;Rise up and give your two wives these two fruits to eat, and
then, king, you will have born to you two heroic sons.&rdquo; Having
said this, Gaur&iacute; disappeared, and the king woke up in the
morning and rose delighted at beholding those fruits in his hand. And
by describing that dream of his he delighted his wives, and bathed and
worshipped the consort of &#346;iva, and broke his fast. And at night
he first visited that wife of his Adhikasangam&aacute;, and gave her
one of the fruits, and she immediately ate it. Then the king spent the
night in her pavilion, out of respect for her father, who was his own
prime minister. And he placed near the head of his bed the second
fruit, which was intended for the other queen. While the king was
asleep, the queen Adhikasangam&aacute; rose up, and desiring for
herself two similar sons, she took from his head and ate that second
fruit also. For women are naturally envious of their rivals. And in the
morning, when the king rose up and was looking for that fruit, she
said&mdash;&ldquo;I ate that second fruit also.&rdquo; Then the king
went away despondent, and after spending the day, he went at night to
the apartments of the second queen. And when she asked for that other
fruit, he said to her&mdash;&ldquo;While I was asleep, your fellow-wife
treacherously devoured it.&rdquo; Then the queen
K&aacute;vy&aacute;lank&aacute;r&aacute;, not having obtained that
fruit, which was to enable her to give birth to a son, remained
silently grieved.</p>
<p>In the course of some days that queen <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9207" title=
"Source: Adhikhasangam&aacute;">Adhikasangam&aacute;</span> became
pregnant, and in due time gave birth to twin sons. And the king
Parity&aacute;gasena rejoiced and made a great feast, since his desire
was fulfilled by their birth. And the king gave the name of
Ind&iacute;varasena to the elder of the two, who was of wonderful
beauty and had eyes like a blue lotus. And he gave to the younger the
name of Anichchhasena, because his mother ate the second fruit against
his wish. Then K&aacute;vy&aacute;lank&aacute;r&aacute;, the second
wife of that king, on beholding this, was angry, and
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! I have been cheated by this rival wife out
of having children; so I must without fail revenge myself on her; I
must destroy these sons of hers by my cunning.&rdquo; Having thus
reflected, she remained thinking over a means of doing this. And as
fast as those two princes grew, the tree of enmity grew in her
heart.</p>
<p>And in course of time those two princes, having attained manhood,
and being mighty of arm, and desirous of conquest, said to their
father&mdash;&ldquo;We have attained manhood and we have been trained
in the use of weapons, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href=
"#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>so how can we remain here endowed
to no profit with these mighty arms? Out on the arms and the youth of a
Kshatriya that longs not for victory! So let us go now, father, and
conquer the regions.&rdquo; When the king Parity&aacute;gasena heard
this request of his sons, he was pleased and consented, and made
arrangements for their expedition. And he said to them, &ldquo;If ever
you are in difficulties, you must think upon the goddess Durg&aacute;
the remover of sorrows, for she gave you to me.&rdquo; Then the king
sent forth those two sons on their expedition, accompanied by his
troops and feudal chiefs, after their mother had performed the
auspicious ceremonies to ensure them success. And he sent after them
his own sagacious prime minister, their maternal grandfather, whose
name was Prathamasangama. Then those two mighty princely brothers, with
their army, first marched in due order to the eastern quarter, and
subdued it. Then these two irresistible heroes of approved might, to
whom many kings had joined themselves, went to the southern quarter to
conquer it. And their parents rejoiced on hearing these tidings of
them, but their second mother was consumed with the fire of concealed
hate. The treacherous queen then got the following false despatch
written in the king&rsquo;s name to the chiefs in the princes&rsquo;
camp, by means of the secretary for foreign affairs, whom she had
bribed with heaps of treasure&mdash;&ldquo;My two sons, having subdued
the earth by the might of their arms, have formed the intention of
killing me and seizing my kingdom; so if you are loyal to me, you must
without hesitation put to death both those sons of
mine.&rdquo;&mdash;This letter K&aacute;vy&aacute;lank&aacute;r&aacute;
sent off secretly by a courier. And the courier went secretly to the
camp of those two princes, and gave that letter to the chiefs. And they
all, after reading it, reflecting that the policy of kings is very
cruel, and considering that that command of their master must not be
disobeyed, met and deliberated in the night, and as they saw no way out
of the difficulty, determined to kill those two princes, though they
had been fascinated by their virtues. But their maternal grandfather,
the minister, who was with them, heard of it from a friend that he had
among the chiefs, and after informing the princes of the state of
affairs, he thereupon mounted them on swift horses, and conveyed them
away safely out of the camp.</p>
<p>The two princes, when conveyed away by the minister at night,
travelled along with him, and entered the Vindhya forest out of
ignorance of the true road. Then, after the night had passed, as they
slowly proceeded on their way, about noon their horses died, overcome
with excessive thirst. And that aged maternal grandfather of theirs,
whose palate was dry with hunger and thirst, died exhausted with the
heat before the eyes of those two, who were also weary. Then those
afflicted brothers exclaimed in their sorrow&mdash;&ldquo;Why has our
father reduced to this state us who are innocent, and fulfilled the
desire of that wicked second mother of ours?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>In
the midst of their lamentation they thought upon the goddess
Ambik&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9218src" href="#xd27e9218"
name="xd27e9218src">6</a> whom their father had long ago pointed out to
them as their natural protectress. That moment, by force of thinking on
that kind protectress, their hunger, thirst and fatigue left them, and
they were strong. Then they were comforted by faith in her, and without
feeling the fatigue of the journey, they went to visit that goddess who
dwells in the Vindhya forest. And when those two brothers had arrived
there, they began a course of fasting and asceticism to propitiate her.
In the meanwhile those chiefs in the camp assembled together in a band,
and went with the intention of doing the princes a mischief; but they
could not find them, though they searched everywhere. They
said&mdash;&ldquo;The princes have escaped somewhere with their
maternal grandfather,&rdquo; and fearing that the whole thing would
come out, they went in a fright to the king Parity&aacute;gasena. And
shewing him the letters, they told him the whole story. He, when he
heard it, was agitated and said to them in his anger; &ldquo;I did not
send this letter, this is some deception. And how comes it that you did
not know, you foolish creatures, that I should not be likely to put to
death two sons obtained by severe austerities? They have been put to
death as far as you are concerned, but they were saved by their own
merits, and their maternal grandfather has exhibited a specimen of his
statesmanship.&rdquo; He said this to the chiefs, and though the
secretary who wrote the treacherous letter fled, the king quickly had
him brought back by his royal power, and after thoroughly investigating
the whole matter, punished him as he deserved. And he threw into a
dungeon his wicked wife K&aacute;vy&aacute;lank&aacute;r&aacute;, who
was guilty of such a crime as trying to slay his sons. For how can an
evil deed audaciously done, the end of which is not considered through
the mind being blinded with excessive hate, help bringing ruin? And as
for those chiefs, who had set out with his two sons and returned, the
king dismissed them, and appointed others in their place. And with
their mother he continued to seek for tidings of those sons, plunged in
grief, devoted to righteousness, thinking upon Durg&aacute;.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that goddess, who has her shrine in the Vindhya
mountains, was pleased with the asceticism of the prince
Ind&iacute;varasena and his younger brother. And she gave
Ind&iacute;varasena a sword in a dream, and appearing to him, thus
addressed him&mdash;&ldquo;By the power of this sword thou shalt
conquer enemies hard to overcome, and whatever thou shalt think of thou
shalt obtain, and by means of it you shall both gain the success you
desire.&rdquo; When the goddess had said that, she disappeared, and
Ind&iacute;varasena, waking up, beheld that sword in his hand. Then he
comforted his younger brother by shewing him that sword, and describing
to him his dream, and in the morning he and his brother broke their
fast on wild fruits. Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href=
"#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>he worshipped that goddess, and
having his fatigue removed by her favour, he departed rejoicing, with
the sword in his hand, in the company of his brother. And after he had
travelled a long distance, he found a great and splendid city, looking
like the peak of Meru on account of its golden houses. There he beheld
a terrible R&aacute;kshasa standing at the gate of the high street, and
the hero asked him what was the name of the town, and who was its king.
That R&aacute;kshasa said&mdash;&ldquo;This city is called
&#346;ailapura, and it is possessed by our lord Yamadansh&#7789;ra, the
slayer of his foes, king of the R&aacute;kshasas.&rdquo; When the
R&aacute;kshasa said this, Ind&iacute;varasena attempted to enter, in
order to slay Yamadansh&#7789;ra, but the R&aacute;kshasa at the door
tried to prevent him, upon which the mighty Ind&iacute;varasena killed
him, cutting off his head with one stroke of his sword. After slaying
him, the hero entered the royal palace, and beheld inside it the
R&aacute;kshasa Yamadansh&#7789;ra sitting on his throne, having a
mouth terrible with tusks, with a lovely woman at his left hand, and a
virgin of heavenly beauty on his right hand. And when
Ind&iacute;varasena saw him, he went with the sword given him by
Durg&aacute; in his hand, and challenged him to fight, and the
R&aacute;kshasa drew his sword and stood up to resist him. And in the
course of the fight Ind&iacute;varasena frequently cut off the
R&aacute;kshasa&rsquo;s head, but it grew again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9228src" href="#xd27e9228" name="xd27e9228src">7</a> Seeing that
magic power of his, and having had a sign made to him by the virgin at
the R&aacute;kshasa&rsquo;s side, who had fallen in love with him at
first sight, the prince, after cutting off the head of the
R&aacute;kshasa, being quick of hand, again cut it in two with a stroke
of his sword. Then the R&aacute;kshasa&rsquo;s magic was baffled by
contrary magic, and his head did not grow again, and the
R&aacute;kshasa died of the wound.</p>
<p>When he was slain, the lovely woman and the princess were delighted,
and the prince with his younger brother sat down, and asked them the
following questions: &ldquo;Why did this R&aacute;kshasa live in such a
city as this, guarded by one warder only, and who are you two, and why
do you rejoice at his being slain?&rdquo; When they heard this, the
virgin was the one that answered, and she spoke as follows: &ldquo;In
this city of &#346;ailapura there lived a king of the name of
V&iacute;rabhuja, and this is his wife Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, and
this R&aacute;kshasa came and devoured him by the help of his magic
power. And he ate up his attendants, but he did not eat this
Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, whom alone he spared because she was
beautiful, but he made her his wife. Then he became disgusted with this
city though beautiful, and building in it houses of gold, he remained
here sporting with Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, having dismissed his
retinue. And I am the younger sister of this R&aacute;kshasa, and
unmarried, but the moment I saw you, I fell in love with you.
Accordingly she is glad at his having been slain, and so also am I; so
marry me here now, my husband, since love makes me offer myself to
you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute; said this,
Ind&iacute;varasena married her then and there by the G&aacute;ndharva
form of marriage. And he remained in that very city, having everything
brought to him, on his thinking of it, by the virtue of the sword of
Durg&aacute;, married and accompanied by his younger brother. And once
on a time he made a chariot that would fly through the air, produced by
thought through the virtue of his sword, that resembled in its powers
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, and placed in it his heroic younger
brother Anichchhasena, and sent him off from his retreat to bear
tidings of him to his parents. Anichchhasena, for his part, travelled
quickly through the air in that chariot, and reached
Ir&aacute;vat&iacute; that city of his father. There he refreshed his
grief-worn parents with the sight of him, as the moon refreshes the
partridges when exhausted with severe heat. And he approached them, and
fell at their feet, and was embraced by them, and when they questioned
him, he dispelled their apprehensions with good news of his brother.
And he told in their presence the whole adventure of himself and his
brother, which in the beginning was sad, but in the end was happy. And
there he heard the treacherous device, which his wicked second mother
had out of enmity contrived for his destruction. Then Anichchhasena
remained there in tranquillity, in the company of his delighted father
and his mother, honoured by the subjects. But after some days had
passed, his fears were aroused by a threatening dream, and he yearned
to see his brother again, and said to his father; &ldquo;I will depart,
and by telling my brother Ind&iacute;varasena that you are anxiously
awaiting him, I will bring him back; give me leave to depart, my
father.&rdquo; When his father heard that, being anxious for the sight
of his son, he and his wife gave Anichchhasena leave to depart, and he
immediately mounted his chariot, and reached through the air that city
of &#346;ailapura. And when he arrived there, he entered the palace of
that brother of his. He saw there his elder brother lying senseless in
the presence of Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute; and
Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, who were weeping. In his perplexity he
asked, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; And then
Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute; said with her eyes fixed on the
ground, though the other blamed her for it; &ldquo;When you were away,
your brother one day, on my going to bathe, had a secret intrigue with
this Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;. And I, on returning from bathing,
found him with her, and I abused him. Then he tried to propitiate me,
but I, being exceedingly bewildered by unforgiving jealousy, that
seemed to have possessed me, thought thus with myself, &lsquo;Ah!
without taking me into account, he favours another; I believe he shews
this insolence confiding in the magic properties of his sword, so I
will hide this weapon of his.&rsquo; After thus reflecting, in my folly
I thrust his sword into the fire at night, while he was asleep. The
consequence was that his sword was dimmed and he was reduced to this
state. And I am grieved for this myself and upbraided by
Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;. So you have come here <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>now
when both our minds are blinded with grief, and we have resolved on
death. So take this sword and kill me with it, since I have proved true
to the customs of my race and acted cruelly.&rdquo; When Anichchhasena
was thus entreated by his brother&rsquo;s wife, he thought that he
ought not to slay her on account of her repentance, but prepared to cut
off his own head. But at that moment, he heard the following voice come
from the air&mdash;&ldquo;Do not act thus, prince, your brother is not
dead, but he has been struck senseless by Durg&aacute;, who is angry at
his not having taken sufficient care of the sword, and you must not
impute guilt to Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, for this
circumstance is the consequence of your all having been born into this
world on account of a curse. And they were both of them your
brother&rsquo;s wives in a former life. So propitiate Durg&aacute; in
order to gain your object.&rdquo; Accordingly Anichchhasena gave up his
intention of slaying himself. But he mounted that chariot, and took
that fire-dimmed sword, and went to propitiate the soles of the feet of
Durg&aacute;, the dweller in the Vindhya range. There he fasted, and
was about to propitiate the goddess with the offering of his head, when
he heard this voice from heaven&mdash;&ldquo;Do not be rash, my son,
go; thy elder brother shall live, and the sword shall become pure from
stain, for I am pleased with thy devotion.&rdquo; When Anichchhasena
heard this speech of the goddess, he immediately saw that the sword in
his hand had recovered its brightness, and he walked round the goddess,
keeping his right hand towards her; and ascending his swift magic car,
as if it were his own desire,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9246src" href=
"#xd27e9246" name="xd27e9246src">8</a> he returned in a state of
anxious expectation to that &#346;ailapura. There he saw that his elder
brother had just risen up, having suddenly regained consciousness, and
weeping he seized his feet, and his elder brother threw his arms round
his neck. And both the wives of Ind&iacute;varasena fell at the feet of
Anichchhasena and said&mdash;&ldquo;You have saved the life of our
husband.&rdquo; Then he told the whole story to his brother
Ind&iacute;varasena who questioned him, and he, when he heard it, was
not angry with Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute;, but was pleased with
his brother.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9249src" href="#xd27e9249"
name="xd27e9249src">9</a></p>
<p>And he heard from the lips of his brother that his parents were
eager to see him, and of the fraud of his second mother, that had
brought about his separation from them; then he took the sword which
his brother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>handed to him, and mounted a large chariot,
which came to him the moment he thought of it, owing to the virtue of
the sword, and with his golden palaces, and his two wives, and his
younger brother Ind&iacute;varasena, returned to his own city
Ir&aacute;vat&iacute;. There he alighted from the air, beheld with
wonder by the subjects, and entered the palace, and went with his
attendants into the presence of the king. And in that condition he
beheld his father and his mother, and fell at their feet with his eyes
bathed in streaming tears. And they, the moment they beheld their son,
embraced him and his younger brother, and having their bodies, as it
were, bathed in nectar, they were relieved from their sorrow. And when
their daughters-in-law, those two wives of Ind&iacute;varasena, of
heavenly beauty, fell at their feet, they looked on them with delight
and welcomed them. And the parents, learning in course of conversation,
that they were said by a divine voice to have been appointed in a
previous life as his wives, were exceedingly delighted. And they
rejoiced with astonishment at the power of their son, which enabled him
to travel through the air, and bring golden palaces and do other things
of this kind. Then Ind&iacute;varasena remained, with those two wives
and his attendants, in the society of his parents, causing delight to
the subjects. And once on a time he took leave of his father, king
Parity&aacute;gasena, and went forth again to conquer the four
quarters, accompanied by his younger brother. And the mighty-armed hero
conquered the whole earth by the virtue of his sword, and came back
bringing with him the gold, elephants, horses and jewels of conquered
kings. And he reached his capital, followed out of fear by the
conquered earth in the form of the army of dust, that his forces
raised. And he entered the palace, where his father advanced to meet
him, and he and his brother delighted their mother Adhikasangam&aacute;
by their return. And after he had honoured the kings,
Ind&iacute;varasena spent that day in pleasure, accompanied by his
wives and his followers. And on the next day the prince made over the
earth to his father by way of tribute from the kings, and suddenly
recollected his former birth. Then, like one waking up from sleep, he
said to his father&mdash;&ldquo;Father, I remember my former birth;
listen, I will tell you all about it. There is a city on the plateau of
the Him&aacute;layas named Mukt&aacute;pura; in it there lives a king
named Mukt&aacute;sena, a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And by a
queen named Kambuvat&iacute; he had born to him in course of time two
virtuous sons, Padmasena and R&uacute;pasena. Then a maiden, named
&Aacute;dityaprabh&aacute;, the daughter of a chief of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, of her own accord, out of love, chose Padmasena for
her husband. Hearing of that, a Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden, of the name
of Chandravat&iacute;, became love-sick also, and came and chose him
for her husband. Then Padmasena, having two wives, was continually
worried by that wife <span class="corr" id="xd27e9269" title=
"Source: Adityaprabh&aacute;">&Aacute;dityaprabh&aacute;</span>, who
was jealous of her rival. And so Padmasena over and over again
importuned his father Mukt&aacute;sena <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>to the following
effect: &lsquo;I cannot endure every day the ill-temper of my wife, who
is blind with jealousy, let me retire to a wood of ascetics to put an
end to this misery. Therefore, father, give me permission.&rsquo; His
father, annoyed at his persistence, cursed him and his wives, saying;
&lsquo;What need is there of your going to a wood of ascetics? Fall
into the world of mortals. There this quarrelsome wife of yours,
&Aacute;dityaprabh&aacute;, shall be born in the race of
R&aacute;kshasas, and become your wife again. And this second,
Chandravat&iacute;, who is virtuous and attached to you, her husband,
shall be the wife of a king, and the paramour of a R&aacute;kshasa, and
shall obtain you as her beloved. And since this R&uacute;pasena has
been observed by me to follow you his elder brother with affection, he
shall be your brother also in that world. There too you shall endure
some affliction caused by your wives.&rsquo; Thus he spoke and ceased,
and appointed this as the termination of the curse; &lsquo;When you,
being a prince, shall conquer the earth and give it to your father,
then you and they shall remember your former birth, and be freed from
your curse.&rsquo; When Padmasena had been thus addressed by his own
father, he went with those others to the world of mortals. I am that
very Padmasena, born here as your son, Ind&iacute;varasena by name, and
I have done what I was appointed to do. And the other Vidy&aacute;dhara
prince, R&uacute;pasena, has been born as Anichchhasena my younger
brother. And as for my wives &Aacute;dityaprabh&aacute;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9274src" href="#xd27e9274" name=
"xd27e9274src">10</a> and Chandravat&iacute;, know that they have been
born here as these two, Kha&#7693;gadansh&#7789;r&aacute; and
Madanadansh&#7789;r&aacute;. And now we have reached that appointed end
of our curse. So let us go, father, to our own Vidy&aacute;dhara
home.&rdquo; Having said this, he together with his brother and his
wives, who remembered their former existence, abandoned the human and
assumed the Vidy&aacute;dhara form. And having worshipped the feet of
his father, and taken his two wives in his arms, he went with his
younger brother through the air to his own city Mukt&aacute;pura. There
the wise prince, gladly welcomed by his father Mukt&aacute;sena, a joy
to the eyes of his mother, accompanied by his brother R&uacute;pasena,
lived with his &Aacute;dityaprabh&aacute;, who did not again display
jealousy, and with Chandravat&iacute; in happiness.</p>
<p>The minister Gomukha, having told this delightful tale on the road,
again said to Narav&aacute;hanadatta; &ldquo;Thus the great must endure
great pains and gain great glory, but others have little pain and
little glory. But you, protected by the might of the science of queen
Ratnaprabh&aacute;, shall without difficulty gain that princess
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this from the lips of the eloquent
Gomukha, he set out on the path with him, insensible to fatigue. And as
he travelled, he came in the evening to a pellucid lake, the lotuses on
which were in full bloom, and which was full of an abundant supply of
cold water, delicious as nectar. Its banks were adorned with
pomegranate trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390"
name="pb390">390</a>]</span>bread-fruit trees, and rows of mango-trees,
and on it the swans sang sweetly. They bathed in it, and devoutly
worshipped the beloved<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9285src" href=
"#xd27e9285" name="xd27e9285src">11</a> of the daughter of
Him&aacute;laya and refreshed themselves with various fragrant,
sweet-tasting, delightful fruits, and then the son of the king of Vatsa
and his friend spent the night on the bank of the lake, sleeping on a
bed strewn with soft young shoots.</p>

<p class="first">The next morning, Narav&aacute;hanadatta rose up from
the bank of that lake,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9295src" href=
"#xd27e9295" name="xd27e9295src">1</a> and setting out on his journey,
said to his minister Gomukha; &ldquo;My friend, I remember, a certain
princess of heavenly beauty, dressed in white garments, came to me
towards the end of last night in a dream, and said this to
me&mdash;&lsquo;Lay aside your anxiety, dear one, for you will quickly
reach a large and wonderful town situated in a forest, on the shore of
the sea. And after resting there, you shall with ease find that town
Karp&uacute;rasambhava, and then win that princess
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;.&rsquo; Having said this, she disappeared, and
I immediately woke up.&rdquo; When he said that, Gomukha was delighted
and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;King, you are favoured by the gods; what
is difficult to you? So your enterprise will certainly succeed without
difficulty.&rdquo; When Gomukha had said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta
hastened along the path with him. And in course of time he reached a
city of vast extent on the shore of the sea, furnished with lofty
mansions resembling the peaks of mountains, with streets, and arches,
adorned with a palace all golden like mount Meru, looking like a second
Earth. He entered that city by the market-street, and beheld that all
the population, merchants, women, and citizens were wooden automata,
that moved as if they were alive, but were recognised as lifeless by
their want of speech. This aroused astonishment in his mind. And in due
course he arrived with Gomukha near the king&rsquo;s palace, and saw
that all the horses and elephants there were of the same material; and
with his minister he entered, full of wonder, that palace, which was
resplendent with seven ranges of golden buildings. There he saw a
majestic man sitting on a jewelled throne, surrounded by warders and
women, who were also wooden automata, the only living being there, who
produced motion in those dull material things, like the soul presiding
over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>the senses. He, for his part, seeing that that
hero Narav&aacute;hanadatta was of noble form, rose up and welcomed
him, and made him sit down on his own seat, and sitting in front of
him, he thus questioned him, &ldquo;Who are you; how and why have you
come to this uninhabited land with one companion?&rdquo; Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta told his own story from the beginning, and asked
that hero, who was prostrating himself before him,&mdash;&ldquo;Who are
you, my good sir, and what is this wonderful city of yours? Tell
me.&rdquo; That man, when he heard that, began to tell his own
story.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the two brothers Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara and
R&aacute;jyadhara.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city named K&aacute;nch&iacute; possessed
of great excellences,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9311src" href=
"#xd27e9311" name="xd27e9311src">2</a> which, like a girdle, well
adorns the earth-bride. In it there was a famous king of the name of
B&aacute;hubala, who won fortune by the might of his arm, and
imprisoned her in his treasury, though she is a gadding dame. We were
two brothers in his kingdom, carpenters by trade, skilful in making
ingenious automata of wood and other materials, such as Maya<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9314src" href="#xd27e9314" name="xd27e9314src">3</a>
first invented. My elder brother was by name Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara,
and he was infatuated with love for a fickle dame, and I, my lord, am
named R&aacute;jyadhara, and I was ever devoted to him. That brother of
mine consumed all my father&rsquo;s property and his own, and some
portion of what I had acquired, which melted by affection I made over
to him. Then he, being much infatuated about the lady, out of desire to
steal wealth for her sake, made a couple of swans of wood with
mechanism and strings attached to them. That pair of swans was sent out
at night by pulling the strings, and entering by means of the
mechanical contrivance into the king&rsquo;s treasury through a window,
they took from it with their beaks jewels placed in a basket, and
returned to the house of my brother. And my elder brother sold the
jewels and spent the money so acquired with his paramour, and in that
way he robbed the king&rsquo;s treasury every night, and though I tried
to prevent him, he would not give up that improper proceeding, for who,
when blinded by passion, distinguishes between right and wrong? And
then the keeper of the treasury, as the king&rsquo;s treasure-house was
plundered night after night without the bolt being moved, though there
were no mice in it, for several days in succession enquired into the
matter, without saying anything, out of fear, and then being
exceedingly vexed, went and told the whole matter plainly to the king.
Then the king posted him and some other guards in the treasure-house at
night, with orders to keep awake in order to find out the truth of it.
Those guards went into the treasure-house at midnight, and while there,
saw my brother&rsquo;s two swans entering there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>by
the window, impelled by strings. The swans moved round by means of
their mechanism and took the jewels, then the guards cut the strings,
and took the swans to shew the king in the morning. And then my elder
brother said in a state of bewilderment&mdash;&ldquo;Brother, my two
swans have been seized by the guards of the treasury, for the strings
have become slack, and the pin of the mechanism has dropped. So we must
both of us leave this place immediately, for the king, when he hears of
it in the morning, will punish us as thieves. For we are both known to
be skilled in mechanical contrivances. And I have here a chariot with a
pneumatic contrivance, which quickly goes eight hundred <i>yojanas</i>,
if you press a spring. Let us go by means of it to-day to a distant
foreign land, though exile may be disagreeable; for how can an evil
deed, that is done in despite of good advice, bring pleasure to any
one? This is the mature fruit of my wickedness in not obeying your
advice, which has extended to innocent you, as well as to me.&rdquo;
After saying this, my brother Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara immediately
mounted with his family that chariot, that flew through the air. But
though he urged me, I would not mount it, as it was laden with many
people, so he flew up in it to the sky and went off to some distant
place.</p>
<p>When that Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9324src" href="#xd27e9324" name="xd27e9324src">4</a> who was
rightly named, had gone off somewhere, I, expecting that in the morning
I singly should he exposed to danger at the hands of the king, mounted
another chariot with a pneumatic mechanism, which I had myself made,
and quickly travelled two hundred <i>yojanas</i> from that place. Then
I again started that air-travelling chariot, and went another two
hundred <i>yojanas</i>. Then I left my chariot, terrified at finding
that I was near the sea, and travelling on my feet, reached in course
of time this city which was empty. And out of curiosity I entered this
palace, which was filled with garments, ornaments, and couches and all
the other conveniences fit for a king. And in the evening I bathed in
the water of the garden-lake, and ate fruits, and going to the royal
bed reflected alone at night&mdash;&ldquo;What am I to do in this
uninhabited spot? So to-morrow I will go hence to some place or other,
for I no longer need fear danger from king B&aacute;hubala.&rdquo; When
I had thus reflected, I went to sleep, and towards the end of night a
hero of divine appearance, mounted on a peacock, thus addressed me in a
dream; &ldquo;You must live here, good sir, you must not depart
elsewhere, and at the time of meals you must go up to the middle court
of the palace, and wait there.&rdquo; Thus he spoke, and disappeared,
and I woke up and reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Undoubtedly this heavenly
place has been made by K&aacute;rtikeya, and he has favoured me with
this dream on account of my merits in a former life. I have turned up
here because I am to be happy dwelling in this town.&rdquo; I conceived
this hope and rose up, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href=
"#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>and said the prayer for the day,
and at the time of eating I went up to the middle court, and while I
was waiting there, golden dishes were placed in front of me, and there
fell into them from heaven food consisting of ghee, milk, rice, boiled
rice and other things;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9337src" href=
"#xd27e9337" name="xd27e9337src">5</a> and any other kinds of food that
I thought of, came to me as fast as I thought of them. After eating all
this, I felt comforted by the favour of the god. So, my lord, I took up
my abode in this city, with kingly luxuries coming to me every day as
fast as I wished for them. But I do not obtain wives and retinue by
thinking of them, so I made all these people of wood. Though I am a
carpenter, since I have come here I enjoy alone all the pleasures of a
king by the power of Destiny, and my name is
R&aacute;jyadhara.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9347src" href=
"#xd27e9347" name="xd27e9347src">6</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So repose, now, a day in this god-built town, and I will
attend upon you to the best of my ability.&rdquo; After saying this,
R&aacute;jyadhara led off with him Narav&aacute;hanadatta and Gomukha
to the city garden, there the prince bathed in the water of the lake
and offered lotuses to &#346;iva, and was conducted to the
feasting-place in the middle court, and there he and his minister
enjoyed viands which were placed before them by R&aacute;jyadhara, who
stood in front of them, to whom they came as soon as he thought of
them. Then the eating-ground was swept by some unseen hand, and after
they had taken betel, they drank wine and remained in great felicity.
And after R&aacute;jyadhara had eaten, the prince retired to a gorgeous
couch, astonished at the wonderful nature of the town, which resembled
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. And when he could not sleep, on account
of his recently conceived longing for Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;,
R&aacute;jyadhara, who was also in bed, asked her story, and then said
to him&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you not sleep, auspicious sir? You will
obtain your desired love. For a fair woman, like Fortune, of her own
accord chooses a man of high courage. I have had ocular proof of this,
so hear the story; I will relate it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Arthalobha and his beautiful wife.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That king of K&aacute;nch&iacute;, B&aacute;hubala,
whom I mentioned to you, had a rich door-keeper, rightly named
Arthalobha.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9359src" href="#xd27e9359" name=
"xd27e9359src">7</a> He had a beautiful wife named
M&aacute;napar&aacute;. That Arthalobha, being by profession a
merchant, and on account of his avarice distrusting his servants,
appointed that wife of his to look after his business in preference to
them. She, though she did not like it, being obedient to him, made
bargains with merchants and captivated all men by her sweet form and
speech. And Arthalobha, seeing that all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>sales of elephants, horses, jewels, and garments
that she made, brought in a profit, rejoiced exceedingly. And once on a
time there came there from a distant foreign land a merchant, named
Sukhadhana, having a large stock of horses and other commodities. The
moment Arthalobha heard that he had come, he said to his
wife&mdash;&ldquo;My dear, a merchant named Sukhadhana has arrived from
a foreign land, he has brought twenty thousand horses, and innumerable
pairs of excellent garments made in China, so please, go and purchase
from him five thousand horses and ten thousand pairs of garments, in
order that with the thousands of horses I already possess and those
other five, I may pay a visit to the king, and carry on my commerce.
When commissioned in these words by that villain Arthalobha,
M&aacute;napar&aacute; went to Sukhadhana; whose eyes were captivated
by her beauty, and who welcomed her gladly. And she demanded from him
for a price those horses and garments. The merchant, overpowered with
love, took her aside and said to her&mdash;&ldquo;I will not give you
one horse or garment for money, but if you will remain one night with
me, I will give you five hundred horses and five thousand
garments.&rdquo; After saying this, he solicited that fair one with
even a larger amount; who does not fall in love with women, who are
allowed to go about without restraint? Then she answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;I will ask my husband about this, for I know he will
send me here out of excessive cupidity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9366src" href="#xd27e9366" name="xd27e9366src">8</a>&rdquo; After
saying this, she went home, and told her husband what the merchant
Sukhadhana had said to her secretly. And that wicked covetous husband
Arthalobha said to her; &ldquo;My dear, if you obtain five hundred
horses and five thousand pairs of garments for one night, what is the
harm in it. So go to him now; you shall return quickly in the
morning.&rdquo; When M&aacute;napar&aacute; heard this speech of her
mean-spirited husband&rsquo;s, she began to debate in her heart, and
thus reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Out on this base spiritless husband of mine
that sells his honour! By continually meditating on gain he has become
all made up of the desire of gain. It is better that the generous man,
who buys me for one night with hundreds of horses and thousands of
pieces of China silk, should be my husband.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, she
took leave of her base husband, saying; &ldquo;It is not my
fault,&rdquo; and went to the house of that Sukhadhana. And he, when he
saw that she had come, after questioning her and hearing the whole
story from her, was astonished, and considered himself fortunate in
obtaining her. And he sent off immediately to her husband Arthalobha
the horses and garments that were to purchase her, as agreed upon. And
he remained that night with her, having all his wishes attained, for
she seemed like the fortune which was the fruit of his own wealth,
incarnate in bodily form, at last obtained by him. And in the morning
the base Arthalobha <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395"
name="pb395">395</a>]</span>sent, in his shamelessness, servants to
summon her, whereupon M&aacute;napar&aacute; said to them, &ldquo;How
can I again return to be the wife of that man who sold me to another? I
am not as shameless as he is. Tell me yourselves if this would be
becoming now. So depart, the man that bought me is my husband.&rdquo;
When the servants were thus addressed by her, they went and repeated
her words to Arthalobha with downcast faces. The mean fellow, when he
heard it, wanted to recover her by force; then a friend of the name of
Harabala said to him; &ldquo;You cannot recover her from that
Sukhadhana, for he is a hero, and I do not behold in you manliness
corresponding to his. For he is moved to heroism by a woman that loves
him on account of his generosity, and he is mighty, and surrounded with
other mighty men that have come with him. But you have been deserted by
your wife, who separated from you because you sold her out of meanness,
and scorn makes you timid, and being reproached you have become
effeminate. Moreover you are not mighty, and you are not surrounded by
mighty friends, so how can you possibly be capable of vanquishing that
rival? And the king will be angry with you, when he hears of your crime
of selling your wife; so keep quiet, and do not make a ridiculous
blunder.&rdquo; Though his friend tried to dissuade him with these
words, Arthalobha went and beset, in his anger, the house of Sukhadhana
with his retainers. While he was thus engaged, Sukhadhana sallied out
with his friends and retainers, and in a moment easily defeated the
whole of Arthalobha&rsquo;s force.</p>
<p>Then Arthalobha fled, and went into the presence of the king. And
concealing his own wicked conduct, he said to the king,&mdash;&ldquo;O
king, the merchant Sukhadhana has carried off my wife by force.&rdquo;
And the king, in his rage, wished to arrest that Sukhadhana. Then a
minister of the name of Sandh&aacute;na said to the
king&mdash;&ldquo;In any case, my lord, you cannot arrest him, for when
his force is increased by that of the eleven friends who have come with
him, he will be found to have more than a hundred thousand excellent
horses. And you have not discovered the truth about the matter, for his
conduct will turn out to be not altogether without cause. So you had
better send a messenger, and ask what it is that this fellow here is
chattering about.&rdquo; When king B&aacute;hubala heard this, he sent
a messenger to Sukhadhana to ask about the matter. The messenger went,
and asked about the matter by the king&rsquo;s order, and thereupon
M&aacute;napar&aacute; told him her story. When B&aacute;hubala heard
that wonderful tale, he came to the house of Sukhadhana to behold the
beauty of M&aacute;napar&aacute;, being filled with excessive
curiosity. There he beheld, while Sukhadhana bent before him,
M&aacute;napar&aacute;, who with the wealth of her beauty would
astonish even the Creator. She prostrated herself at his feet, and he
questioned her, and heard from her own mouth how the whole thing
happened, Arthalobha being present and listening. When he heard it, he
thought it was true, because Arthalobha <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>was speechless, and
he asked that fair one what was to be done now. Then she said
decidedly, &ldquo;How can I return to that spiritless avaricious man,
who sold me to another man without the excuse of distress?&rdquo; When
the king heard this, he said, &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; and then
Arthalobha bewildered with desire, wrath, and shame,
exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;King, let him and me fight with our own
retainers, without any auxiliary forces; then let it be seen who is
spirited and who is spiritless.&rdquo; When Sukhadhana heard this, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;Then let us fight in single combat, what need is
there of retainers? M&aacute;napar&aacute; shall be the prize of the
victor.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he said, &ldquo;Good! so let
it be!&rdquo; Then, before the eyes of M&aacute;napar&aacute; and the
king, they both entered the lists mounted. And in the course of the
combat, Sukhadhana laid Arthalobha on the plain, by his horse&rsquo;s
rearing on account of a lance-wound. Then Arthalobha fell three times
more on the earth, on account of his horse being killed, but
Sukhadhana, who was a fair fighter, restrained himself and would not
slay him. But the fifth time Arthalobha&rsquo;s horse fell upon him,
and bruised him, and he was carried off by his servants motionless.
Then Sukhadhana was cheered by all the spectators with shouts of
applause, and the king B&aacute;hubala honoured him as he deserved. And
he immediately bestowed a gift of honour upon the lady, and he
confiscated the property of Arthalobha, which had been acquired by
unlawful means; and appointing another to his office, he departed
pleased to his palace. For good men derive satisfaction from breaking
off their connection with the bad. And Sukhadhana, having maintained
his claim by force, remained enjoying himself in the society of
M&aacute;napar&aacute; his loving wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus wives and wealth leave the mean-spirited man, and of
their own accord come to the high-spirited man from every quarter. So
dismiss anxiety! Go to sleep! in a short time, my lord, you will obtain
that princess Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;.&rdquo; When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard that sound advice of
R&aacute;jyadhara&rsquo;s, he and Gomukha went off to sleep.</p>
<p>And in the morning, while the prince was waiting awhile after his
meal, the wise Gomukha addressed R&aacute;jyadhara as follows:
&ldquo;Make such an ingenious chariot for my master, as that he shall
be able by means of it to reach the city of Karp&uacute;rasambhava, and
obtain his beloved.&rdquo; When thus supplicated, that carpenter
offered Narav&aacute;hanadatta the chariot with a pneumatic
contrivance, that he had made before. He ascended that sky-travelling
chariot, swift as thought, together with Gomukha, and crossed the deep,
the home of monsters, that agitated its waves as if exulting to behold
his valour, and reached the city of Karp&uacute;rasambhava on its
shore. There the chariot descended from the sky, and he and Gomukha
left it, and out of curiosity wandered about inside the town. And by
questioning the people he found out that he had indeed without doubt
reached the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>desired city, and delighted he went to the
neighbourhood of the palace. There he found a splendid house occupied
by an old woman, and he entered it to stay there, and she received him
with respect. And eager to hit upon an artifice, he immediately asked
that woman, &ldquo;Noble lady, what is the name of the king here, and
what children has he? And tell us of their appearance, for we are
foreigners.&rdquo; When he said this to the old woman, she, seeing that
he was of excessively noble form, answered&mdash;&ldquo;Listen,
illustrious sir, I will tell you all. In this city of
Karp&uacute;rasambhava there is a king named Karp&uacute;raka. And he,
having no children, performed penance, with his wife
Buddhik&aacute;r&iacute;, fasting, in honour of &#346;iva, in order to
obtain offspring. After he had fasted for three nights, the god
&#346;iva commanded him in a dream&mdash;&lsquo;Rise up, a daughter
shall be born to you, who shall be superior to a son, and whose husband
shall obtain the sovereignty of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rsquo; After
receiving this order from &#346;iva, the king woke up in the morning;
and, after communicating this dream to his wife
Buddhik&aacute;r&iacute;, he rose up and went off delighted, and with
his queen broke his fast. And then in a short time that queen conceived
by the king, and when the period was completed, she brought forth a
daughter beautiful in all her limbs. She surpassed in splendour the
lights in the lying-in chamber,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9381src"
href="#xd27e9381" name="xd27e9381src">9</a> and they, as it were,
heaved sighs by discharging lamp-black. And her father made great
rejoicings, and gave her the name of Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, which is
his own name made feminine. And gradually that moonlight of the eyes of
the people, the princess Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, has grown up, and is
now in the full bloom of youth. And her father, the king here, desires
to have her married, but the haughty girl detests men, and will not
consent. And when my daughter, who is her friend, put this question to
her &lsquo;My dear, why do you not desire marriage, the only fruit of a
daughter&rsquo;s birth?&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;My dear, I remember
my former birth, and the cause is something which happened then; hear
it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the princess Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; in her
birth as a swan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the shore of the ocean there is a great sandal-wood
tree. Near it there is a lake adorned with full-blown lotuses. I was a
female swan on that lake on account of my actions in a previous birth.
Once on a time, out of fear of the sea, I made a nest in that
sandal-wood tree with my husband, who was a male swan. When I was
dwelling in that nest, I had male offspring born to me, and suddenly a
great wave of the sea came and carried them off. When the flood carried
away my children, out of grief I wept and took no food; and remained in
front of a <i>linga</i> of &#346;iva on the shore of the sea. Then that
male swan, my husband, came to me and said&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, why do
you lament your children that are dead, we shall get other
ones.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9395src" href="#xd27e9395" name=
"xd27e9395src">10</a> As long as life is preserved, everything can be
obtained.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>His speech pierced my heart like an arrow,
and I reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! males are thus wickedly regardless
of their youthful offspring, and show no affection to, or compassion
for their females, though they are attached to them. So of what comfort
is this husband to me? Of what use is this body that brings only
pain?&rdquo; Thus reflecting, I prostrated myself before &#346;iva, and
devoutly placed him in my heart, and then in front of his symbol,
before the eyes of the swan, my husband, I uttered this prayer;
&ldquo;May I become in the next birth a princess remembering my former
state,&rdquo;&mdash;and thereupon I flung myself into the sea.
Consequently, I have been born in this life such as you see. And
because I remember the cruelty of that husband in a former birth, my
mind does not feel inclined to any suitor. So I do not desire to be
married; the rest is in the hands of Destiny. &ldquo;This is what the
princess said then in private to my daughter, and that daughter of mine
came and told it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my son, I have told you what you asked me. And that
princess is undoubtedly destined to be your wife. For she was long ago
designated by the god &#346;iva as the wife of the future emperor of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And I see that you are marked with all the
distinguishing signs of an emperor, such as the peculiar freckle, and
other marks. Perhaps you are some distinguished person brought here by
Providence for that very purpose. Rise up, for the present we will see
what there is in my house in the way of provision.&rdquo; After the old
lady had told him this, she brought him food, and he and Gomukha spent
the night there. And in the morning, the prince deliberated in private
with Gomukha as to the steps to be taken, and then he assumed the dress
of a P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic, and accompanied by Gomukha, he went
to the king&rsquo;s gate, and roamed about in front of it, crying out
again and again&mdash;&ldquo;Ah my female swan! Ah my female
swan!&rdquo; And the people gazed at him<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9404" title="Source: ..">.</span> And when the maids beheld him
thus employed, they went in astonishment and said to the princess
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;; &ldquo;Your Highness! we have seen at the
royal gate a P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic who, though he has a fellow,
is unfellowed in beauty,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9407src" href=
"#xd27e9407" name="xd27e9407src">11</a> and he continually utters these
words, &lsquo;Ah my female swan! Ah my female swan!&rsquo; which
bewilders the minds of the women.&rdquo; When the princess heard this,
she, as having been a swan in a former birth, was filled with
curiosity, and had him, just as he was, conducted by her maids into her
presence. And she saw that he was adorned with infinite beauty, like a
new god of Love that had taken a vow to propitiate &#346;iva. And she
said to him, when he looked at her with an eye expanded by curiosity,
&ldquo;What is this that you are continually saying, &lsquo;Ah! my
female swan! Ah! my female swan?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Though she said
this to him, he went on to say&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! my female swan!&rdquo;
Then his companion Gomukha answered her; &ldquo;I will explain this in
a few words, listen, Your Highness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In a former birth he was a swan on account of his actions in
an anterior state of existence. Then he built himself a nest in a
sandal-wood tree, on the bank of a great lake near the shore of the
sea, and lived there with his female. And as it happened, their
offspring in that nest were swept away by a wave, and his female,
distracted with grief, threw herself into the sea. Then he, being
grieved at separation from her, and disgusted with his bird-nature,
desirous of leaving that body, made a pious wish in his
heart&mdash;&lsquo;May I be in a future life a prince remembering my
former state, and may this virtuous female swan be my wife, remembering
her former existence also.&rsquo; Then he thought on &#346;iva, and
scorched with the fire of grief, flung that body into the water of the
sea. So he has been now born, my fair lady, as Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
the son of the king of Vatsa in Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, with the
power of recollecting his former existence. When he was born, a voice
said distinctly from heaven; &lsquo;This prince shall be the emperor of
all the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rsquo; In course of time, when
he had become crown-prince, he was married by his father to the goddess
Madanamanchuk&aacute; of heavenly appearance, who had been born for a
certain reason as a woman. And then the daughter of a king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas named Hemaprabha, the maiden Ratnaprabh&aacute;,
came of her own accord, and chose him for a husband. Nevertheless,
thinking on that female swan, he does not enjoy tranquillity; and he
told this to me, who have been his servant from my childhood. Then,
while he was out hunting, it happened that he and I had a meeting in
the forest with a holy female hermit. And in the course of conversation
she said to him with favouring condescension&mdash;&lsquo;Owing to the
effect of his actions the god of Love, my son, became a swan. And a
heavenly female, that had fallen through a curse, became his dear wife,
when he was dwelling, as a swan, in a sandal-wood tree on the bank of
the sea. But she threw herself into the sea, through grief at her
offspring having been carried away by the tide, and then the male swan
flung himself into the sea also. He has now by the favour of &#346;iva
been born as yourself, the son of the king of Vatsa, and you know of
that former birth of yours, my son, for you remember your former
existence. And that female swan has been now born in
Karp&uacute;rasambhava, a city on the shore of the sea, as a princess,
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; by name. Therefore, go there, my son, and win
her to wife.&rsquo; When the holy female hermit had said this, she flew
up into the sky and disappeared. And this lord of mine, having heard
this information, immediately set out with me to come here. And being
attracted by love for you, he risked his life, and after traversing a
hundred difficulties, he reached the shore of the sea. There we had an
interview with the carpenter, named R&aacute;jyadhara, who dwells in
Hemapura, and who gave us an ingenious chariot. We have mounted on this
terrible machine, as if it were our courage having taken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>shape,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9415src" href=
"#xd27e9415" name="xd27e9415src">12</a> and have crossed the perilous
gulf of the sea, and arrived at this town. For this reason, queen, my
master wandered about, exclaiming, &lsquo;Ah my female swan!&rsquo;
until he came into your presence. Now, from the pleasing sight of the
noble moon of your countenance, he enjoys the removal of the darkness
caused by the presence of innumerable woes. Now, honour your noble
guest with the blue lotus garland of your look.&rdquo; When
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; heard this feigned speech of Gomukha&rsquo;s,
she thought it was true, relying on the fact that it harmonized with
her own recollections. And she melted in her soul with love, and she
thought, &ldquo;After all this husband of mine was attached to me, and
my despondency was causeless.&rdquo; And she said&mdash;&ldquo;I am in
truth that very female swan, and I am fortunate in that my husband has
for my sake endured suffering in two births. So now I am your slave,
overcome by love;&rdquo; and saying this, she honoured
Narav&aacute;hanadatta with baths and other hospitalities. Then she
informed her father of all this by the mouth of her attendants, and he,
the moment he heard it, came to her. Then the king thought himself
fortunate, having seen that his daughter had conceived a desire to be
married, and that an appropriate suitor for her had at length arrived
in Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who was marked with all the signs of a great
emperor. And he gave, with all due honour, his daughter
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; to Narav&aacute;hanadatta according to the
prescribed form. And he gave to that son-in-law of his, at every
circumambulation from left to right of the sacred fire, thirty millions
of gold-pieces, and as many lumps of camphor, the heaps of which
appeared like the peaks of Meru and Kail&aacute;sa that had witnessed
the marriage of P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, come to behold his magnificence.
Moreover the king Karp&uacute;raka, who had attained his wish, gave
Narav&aacute;hanadatta a hundred millions of excellent garments and
three hundred female slaves well adorned. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta,
after his marriage, remained with that Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, as if
with affection incarnate in bodily form. Whose mind was not delighted
at the union of that couple, which resembled the marriage of the
spring-creeper and the spring-festival?</p>
<p>And on the next day Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who had attained his
object, said to his beloved Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, &ldquo;Come, let
us go to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;.&rdquo; Then she answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;If it is to be so, why should we not go there
immediately in this chariot of yours that flies through the air? If it
is too small, I will furnish another large one, for there is living
here a mechanic who makes ingenious chariots, who has come from a
foreign land, Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara by name; I will cause him quickly
to make such a chariot.&rdquo; After saying this, she called the warder
that kept the door, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Go and order that
chariot-maker Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara to prepare a large chariot, that
will travel through the air, for us to start in.&rdquo; Then the queen
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;, having dismissed the warder, informed her
father by the mouth of a slave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401"
href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>of her desire to depart. And
while the king, on hearing it, was coming thither,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta thus reflected; &ldquo;This
Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara is certainly the brother of R&aacute;jyadhara,
whom he described as having run away from his native land through fear
of his king.&rdquo; While he was thus thinking, the king quickly
arrived, and that mechanic Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara came with the
warder, and said&mdash;&ldquo;I have ready-made a very large chariot,
which will easily carry at this instant thousands of men.&rdquo; When
the mechanic said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta said
&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and asked him courteously; &ldquo;Are you the
elder brother of R&aacute;jyadhara, skilled in various very great
mechanical contrivances?&rdquo; And <span class="corr" id="xd27e9425"
title="Source: Pr&aacute;nadhara">Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara</span>
answered him, bowing before him&mdash;&ldquo;I am that very brother of
his, but how does Your Highness know about us?&rdquo; Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta told him what R&aacute;jyadhara had told him,
and how he had seen him. Then Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara joyfully brought
him the chariot, and he mounted it with Gomukha, after having been
politely dismissed by his father-in-law the king, and after bidding
farewell to him; but first he placed in it the slaves, camphor and
gold. And he took with him Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara, whom the king
permitted to depart, and that head-warder, and his recently married
wife Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;; and his mother-in-law uttered a solemn
prayer for a blessing on his journey, and from those stores of splendid
garments he bestowed gifts on the Br&aacute;hmans; and he said to
Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara&mdash;&ldquo;First let us go to
R&aacute;jyadhara on the shore of the sea, and then home.&rdquo; Then
the chariot was driven on by Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara, and the king and
his wife flew up into the air quickly by means of it, as if by his
accomplished wish.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9428src" href=
"#xd27e9428" name="xd27e9428src">13</a> In a moment he crossed the sea,
and reached again that city of Hemapura on its shore, the abode of that
R&aacute;jyadhara. There R&aacute;jyadhara bowed before him, delighted
at beholding his brother, and as he had no female slaves, the prince
honoured him with the gift of some, at which he greatly rejoiced. And
after taking leave of R&aacute;jyadhara, whose tears flowed fast, as he
could hardly bear to part from his elder brother, the prince reached
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; in that same chariot. Then the people, on
beholding the prince unexpectedly descend from heaven, riding in that
splendid chariot, followed by his retainers, and accompanied by his new
bride, were much astonished. And his father, the king of Vatsa, having
gathered from the exultations of the citizens that his son had arrived,
was delighted, and went out to meet him, accompanied by the queen, the
ministers, his daughter-in-law, and other persons. And the king,
beholding that son prostrate at his feet with his wife, received him
gladly, and thought that the fact, that he was to be the future emperor
of the aerial spirits, was clearly revealed by his coming in a flying
chariot. His mother V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;, with
Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, embraced him, and she shed a tear, which
dropped like the knot of pain loosened by seeing him. And his wife
Ratnaprabh&aacute; was delighted, and Madanamanchuk&aacute;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>also, and their jealousy being overcome by love
for him, they embraced his feet, and won his heart at the same time.
And the prince delighted his father&rsquo;s ministers, headed by
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: Yaugandhar&aacute;yana">Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a</span>,
and his own, headed by Marubh&uacute;ti, when they bowed before him, by
rewarding them as they severally deserved. And they all, with the king
of Vatsa at their head, welcomed that new wife Karp&uacute;rik&aacute;,
who bowed becomingly before them, like the goddess of Fortune arrived
surrounded by a hundred immortal nymphs, even the sister-shape of
Am&#7771;ita,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9437src" href="#xd27e9437"
name="xd27e9437src">14</a> openly brought by her husband, having
crossed the sea adorned with its shore as a garment with a beautiful
fringe. And the king of Vatsa honoured that warder of her
father&rsquo;s, giving him many crores of gold-pieces, garments and
lumps of camphor, which had been brought in the chariot. And the king
then honoured Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara as the benefactor of his son
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, who had pointed him out as the maker of the
chariot. And then the king honoured Gomukha, and asked him joyfully,
&ldquo;How did you obtain this princess? And how did you start from
this place?&rdquo; And then Gomukha deftly told the king of Vatsa, with
his wives and ministers, in private, the whole adventure, as it took
place, beginning with their going to the forest to
hunt,&mdash;&mdash;how they met the female hermit, and how they crossed
the sea by means of the chariot provided by R&aacute;jyadhara, and how
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; was obtained with her female attendants, though
she was averse to marriage, and how they returned by the way by which
they went, in a chariot which they obtained by finding
Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara. Then all of them, shaking their heads in
astonishment and joy, said&mdash;&ldquo;To think of the concurrence of
all these circumstances, the chase, and the female ascetic, the
carpenter R&aacute;jyadhara skilled in mechanical contrivances found on
the shore of the sea, the crossing the ocean in the chariot that he
made, and that another maker of these chariots should have previously
reached the other side of the ocean! The truth is, Destiny takes
trouble to provide the fortunate with the means of obtaining prosperous
success.&rdquo; Then all respectfully commended Gomukha for his
devotion to his lord. And they praised queen Ratnaprabh&aacute;, who by
her knowledge protected her lord on his journey, for she produced
general satisfaction by acting like a woman devoted to her husband.
Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having made his party of air-travellers
forget the fatigues of their journey, entered his palace with his
father, and mother, his wives and other relations. Then his treasury
was filled with heaps of gold by the friends and relations who came to
see him, and whom he honoured, and he loaded Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara
and his father-in-law&rsquo;s warder with wealth. And
Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara, immediately after he had taken food,
respectfully addressed this petition to him&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, king
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; gave us the following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>order&mdash;&lsquo;You must come back quickly as
soon as my daughter has reached her husband&rsquo;s palace, in order
that I may have early news of her arrival.&rsquo; So we must certainly
go there quickly this very moment; give us a letter from
Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; to the king written with her own hand. For
otherwise the heart of the king, which is attached to his daughter,
will not take comfort. For he, never having mounted an air-chariot,
fears that we may have fallen from it. So give me the letter, and
permit this head-warder, who is desirous of ascending the chariot, to
depart with me. But I will return here, crown-prince, and will bring my
family, for I cannot abandon the two ambrosial lotuses of your
feet.&rdquo; When Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara said this firmly, the son of
the king of Vatsa immediately made Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; sit down to
write that letter. It ran as follows, &ldquo;My father, you must not
feel anxious about me, since I share the happiness and possess the love
of a good husband; was the goddess Lakshm&iacute; an object of anxiety
to the ocean after she had betaken herself to the Supreme
Bridegroom?&rdquo; When she had written the above letter with her own
hand, and given it, the son of the king of Vatsa dismissed the warder
and Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara with honour. And they ascended the chariot,
and produced astonishment in the minds of all, as they were seen going
through the air, and crossing the sea they went to the city of
Karp&uacute;rasambhava. There they delighted the king Karp&uacute;raka
by reading out his daughter&rsquo;s letter, which told that she had
reached her husband&rsquo;s palace. The next day
Pr&aacute;&#7751;adhara took leave of the king, and after visiting
R&aacute;jyadhara, repaired with his family into the presence of
Narav&aacute;hanadatta. Narav&aacute;hanadatta, when he had returned
thus quickly after accomplishing his mission, gave him a dwelling near
his palace and an ample allowance. And he amused himself, and his
wives, by going about in the flying chariots made by him, as if
rehearsing future journeyings in the skies as emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.</p>
<p>Thus, having delighted his friends, followers and wives, and
obtained a third wife Karp&uacute;rik&aacute; in addition to
Ratnaprabh&aacute; and Madanamanchuk&aacute;, the son of the king of
Vatsa spent those days in happiness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Thus Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, dwelt
happily in his father&rsquo;s house, after he had won those wives. And
one day, when he was in his father&rsquo;s assembly-hall, he saw a man
of heavenly appearance come there, descending from heaven. And after he
and his father had welcomed the man, who bowed before him, he
immediately asked him, &ldquo;Who are you and why have you come?&rdquo;
Then he answered&mdash;&ldquo;There is a city in this earth on the
ridge of Himavat, called Vajrak&uacute;&#7789;a,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9467src" href="#xd27e9467" name="xd27e9467src">2</a> and rightly
so called, as being all made of diamond. There I dwelt, as a king of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas named Vajraprabha, and my name too was rightly
given me, because my body is framed of diamond. And I received this
command from &#346;iva, (who was pleased with my austerities,)
&ldquo;If thou remainest loyal at the appointed time to the emperor
created by me, thou shalt become by my favour invincible to thy
enemies.&rdquo; Accordingly I have come here without delay to pay my
respects to my sovereign: for I have already perceived by means of my
science that the son of the king of Vatsa, (who is born of a portion of
the god of Love, and appointed by the god who wears a digit of the
moon,) though a mortal, shall be sole emperor over both divisions of
our territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9472src" href="#xd27e9472"
name="xd27e9472src">3</a> And though, by the favour of &#346;iva, a
prince of the name of S&uacute;ryaprabha was ruler over us for a
<i>kalpa</i> of the gods, still he was only lord in the southern
division, but in the northern division a prince called
&#346;ruta&#347;arman was emperor; but your majesty, being destined for
great good fortune, shall be sole emperor here over the wanderers of
the air, and your dominion shall endure for a <i>kalpa</i>.&rdquo;

<p>When the Vidy&aacute;dhara said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, in the
presence of the king of Vatsa, said to him again out of curiosity:
&ldquo;How did S&uacute;ryaprabha, being a man, obtain of old time the
sovereignty over the Vidy&aacute;dharas? Tell us.&rdquo; Then in
private, that is to say, in the presence of the queens and ministers,
the king Vajraprabha began to tell that tale.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of S&uacute;ryaprabha, and how he attained
sovereignty over the Vidy&aacute;dharas.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of old there was in the country of the people of Madra
a town named &#346;&aacute;kala;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9495src"
href="#xd27e9495" name="xd27e9495src">4</a> Chandraprabha, the son of
Ang&aacute;raprabha, was king of it, whose name expressed his nature,
as he delighted the whole world, but he was like fire in that he
scorched his enemies. By his wife, named K&iacute;rtimat&iacute;, there
was born to that king a son, whose future glory was indicated by his
exceedingly auspicious marks. And when he was born, a clear voice
sounded from heaven, which rained nectar into the ears of king
Chandraprabha, &ldquo;This king, now born, named S&uacute;ryaprabha, is
appointed by &#346;iva as the future emperor over the kings of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then that prince S&uacute;ryaprabha grew up in the
house of his father, who was distinguished by the delightful favour of
the enemy of Pura,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9498src" href=
"#xd27e9498" name="xd27e9498src">5</a> and he being very clever,
gradually acquired, while still a child, all knowledge and all the
accomplishments by sitting at the feet of a teacher; and then, when he
was sixteen years old, and captivated the subjects by his virtues, his
father Chandraprabha appointed him crown-prince, and he gave him the
sons of his own ministers, many in number, Bh&aacute;sa,
Prabh&aacute;sa, Siddh&aacute;rtha, Prahasta and others. And while he
was bearing with them the burden of a crown-prince&rsquo;s duty, one
day a great Asura of the name of Maya came there, and Maya went up in
the assembly-hall to king Chandraprabha, who welcomed him, and said to
him in the presence of S&uacute;ryaprabha, &ldquo;King, this son of
yours, S&uacute;ryaprabha, has been appointed as the future emperor of
the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas by &#346;iva; so why does he not
acquire the magic sciences that will put him in possession of the
dignity? For this reason I am sent here by the god &#346;iva. Permit me
to take him, and teach him the right method of employing the sciences,
which will be the cause of his obtaining the sovereignty of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas. For he has a rival in this business, a lord of the
sky-goers named &#346;ruta&#347;arman; he too has been appointed by
&#346;iva. But this prince, after acquiring the power of the sciences,
shall conquer him with our help, and become emperor over the lords of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; When Maya said this, king Chandraprabha
said&mdash;&ldquo;We are fortunate; let this auspicious one be taken by
you wherever you wish.&rdquo; Then Maya took leave of the king, and
quickly carried off to P&aacute;t&aacute;la S&uacute;ryaprabha and his
ministers, whom the king permitted to depart. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>There he taught the prince ascetic practices of
such a kind, that by means of them the prince and his ministers quickly
acquired the sciences. And he taught him also the art of providing
himself with magic chariots, so that he acquired a chariot named
Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana. Then Maya brought S&uacute;ryaprabha, mounted
on that chariot, with his ministers, having acquired the sciences, back
to his own city from P&aacute;t&aacute;la. And after he had led him
into the presence of his parents, he said to him, &ldquo;Now I depart,
enjoy here all the enjoyments given by your magic knowledge until I
return.&rdquo; After saying this, the Asura Maya departed, after having
been duly honoured, and king Chandraprabha rejoiced in his son&rsquo;s
having acquired the sciences.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, by virtue of the sciences, was continually
roaming through many countries in his chariot, with his ministers, to
amuse himself. And wherever any princess beheld him, she was
immediately bewildered by love, and chose him for her husband. The
first was the virgin daughter of the king of T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;,
who was called V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a; her name was Madanasen&aacute;,
and she was the first beauty of the world. The second was
Chandrik&aacute;vat&iacute; the daughter of Subha&#7789;a, the emperor
of the western border, who had been carried off by the Siddhas and left
somewhere else. And the third was the famous daughter of
Kumbh&iacute;ra, the king of the city of K&aacute;nch&iacute;,
Varu&#7751;asen&aacute; by name, remarkable for her beauty. And the
fourth was the daughter of king Paurava, sovereign of
L&aacute;v&aacute;naka, Sulochan&aacute; by name, with lovely eyes. And
the fifth was the daughter of king Suroha, the lord of the land of
China, Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute; with charming limbs, yellow as gold.
And the sixth was the daughter of king K&aacute;ntisena, ruler in the
land of &#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha, surpassing in beauty the
Apsarases. And the seventh was Parapush&#7789;&aacute;, the daughter of
king Janamejaya, the lord of the city of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, a
sweet-voiced maid. And though the relations of these maidens, who were
carried off by a surprise, found out what had happened, still, as the
prince was confident in the might of his supernatural science, they
were pliant as canes. These wives also acquired the sciences, and
S&uacute;ryaprabha associated with them all at the same time, taking
many bodies by his magic skill. Then he amused himself, in the company
of these wives, and of the ministers Prahasta and others, with roaming
in the air, with concerts, drinking-parties and other amusements.
Possessing heavenly skill in painting, he drew the Vidy&aacute;dhara
females, and in that way, and by making sportive sarcastic speeches, he
enraged those charmers, and he was amused at their faces, furrowed with
frowns, and with reddened eyes, and at their speeches, the syllables of
which faltered on their trembling lips. And that prince went with his
wives to T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, and roaming through the air sported
in the gardens with Madanasen&aacute;<span class="corr" id="xd27e9507"
title="Not in source">.</span> And having left his wives there, he went
in the chariot Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana, and accompanied by Prahasta
only, visited the city called Vajrar&aacute;tra. There he carried off
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>daughter of king Rambha before his eyes,
T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute; by name, who was enamoured of him, and
burning with the fire of love. And he came back to
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, and there carried off again another maiden
princess, by name Vil&aacute;sin&iacute;. And when her haughty brother
Sahasr&aacute;yudha was annoyed at it, he paralyzed him by his
supernatural power. And he also stupefied Sahasr&aacute;yudha&rsquo;s
mother&rsquo;s brother, who came with him, and all his retainers, and
made his head shorn of hair, because he wished to carry off his beloved
ones. But though he was angry, he spared to slay them both, because
they were his wife&rsquo;s relatives, but he taunted them, who were
downcast on account of the overthrow of their pride, and let them go.
Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, surrounded by nine wives, having been summoned
by his father, returned in his chariot to his city
&#346;&aacute;kala.</p>
<p>And then king V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a sent from
T&aacute;mralipt&iacute; an ambassador to S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s
father, king Chandraprabha, and gave him the following message to
deliver&mdash;&ldquo;Your son has carried off my two daughters, but let
that be, for he is a desirable husband for them, as he is a master of
supernatural sciences, but, if you love us, come here now, in order
that we may make a friendship based upon the due performance of
marriage rites and hospitality.&rdquo; Thereupon king Chandraprabha
rewarded the messenger, and determined that he would quickly start for
that place on the morrow. But he sent Prahasta, as an ambassador to
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a, in order to make sure of his sincerity, and
gave him Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana to travel in. Prahasta went quickly
and had an interview with king <span class="corr" id="xd27e9514" title=
"Source: V&iacute;r&aacute;bha&#7789;a">V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a</span>,
and questioned him about the business, and was informed and highly
honoured by him,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9517src" href="#xd27e9517"
name="xd27e9517src">6</a> and promised him, who smiled graciously, that
his masters would come early next morning, and then he returned in a
moment to Chandraprabha through the air. And he told that king that
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a was ready to receive him. The king, for his
part, being pleased, shewed honour to that minister of his son&rsquo;s.
Then king Chandraprabha with queen K&iacute;rtimat&iacute;, and
S&uacute;ryaprabha with Vil&aacute;sin&iacute; and Madanasen&aacute;,
mounted that chariot Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana, and went off early next
day with retinue and ministers. In one watch only of the day they
reached T&aacute;mralipt&iacute;, being beheld, as they passed through
the air, by the people with eyes the lashes of which were upraised
through wonder. And descending from the sky, they entered the city side
by side with king V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a, who came out to meet them;
the beautiful streets of the town were irrigated at every step with
sandal-wood water, and seemed to be strewed with blue lotuses by means
of the sidelong glances of the city ladies. There
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a honoured his connexion and his son-in-law, and
duly performed the marriage ceremony of his daughters. And king
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a gave at the marriage-altar of those daughters, a
thousand loads of pure gold, and a hundred camels laden with burdens of
ornaments made of jewels; and five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409"
href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>hundred camels laden with
loads of various garments, and fifty thousand horses, and five thousand
elephants, and a thousand lovely women adorned with beauty and jewels.
And moreover he gratified his son-in-law S&uacute;ryaprabha and his
parents with valuable jewels and territories. And he duly honoured his
ministers, Prahasta and others, and he made a feast at which all the
people of the city rejoiced. And S&uacute;ryaprabha remained there in
the company of his parents, and his beloved wives, enjoying delights,
consisting of various dainties, wines, and music.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile an ambassador arrived from Rambha in
Vajrar&aacute;tra, and in the hall of assembly delivered this message
from his master: &ldquo;The crown-prince S&uacute;ryaprabha, confiding
in the might of his sciences, has insulted us by carrying off our
daughter. But to-day we have come to know, that he has undertaken to be
reconciled to king V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a, whose misfortune is the same
as ours. If in the same way you agree to be reconciled to us, come here
also quickly, if not, we will in this matter salve our honour by
death.&rdquo; When king Chandraprabha heard that, he honoured the
ambassador, and said to him, &ldquo;Go to that Rambha and give him this
message from me: &lsquo;Why do you afflict yourself without cause? For
S&uacute;ryaprabha is now appointed by &#346;iva the future emperor of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas; and inspired sages have declared that your
daughter and others are to be his wives. So your daughter has attained
her proper place, but you being stern were not asked for her. So be
appeased, you are our friend, we will come to your residence
also.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When Prahasta received this message from the
king, he went through the air, and in a single watch he reached
Vajrar&aacute;tra. There he told his message to Rambha, and having been
gladly received by him, he returned as he came, and reported it to king
Chandraprabha. Then Chandraprabha sent his minister Prabh&aacute;sa,
and had king Rambha&rsquo;s daughter T&aacute;r&aacute;val&iacute;
conducted to him from &#346;&aacute;kala. Then he departed in the
air-chariot with S&uacute;ryaprabha, being dismissed with great honour
by king V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a and all others. And he reached
Vajrar&aacute;tra, which was full of people awaiting his arrival, and
was met by Rambha, and entered his palace. There Rambha, having
performed the great feast of the marriage ceremony, gave his daughter
countless stores of gold, elephants, horses, jewels, and other
valuables. And he gratified so lavishly his son-in-law
S&uacute;ryaprabha, that he forgot all his own luxuries. And while they
were remaining there delighted with feasts, an ambassador came from the
city of K&aacute;nch&iacute; to Rambha. Rambha having heard his
message, said to king Chandraprabha&mdash;&ldquo;King, the lord of
K&aacute;nch&iacute;, named Kumbh&iacute;ra, is my elder brother; he
has to-day sent me a trustworthy messenger to speak this speech;
&lsquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha first carried off my daughter, then yours.
And now you have made friendship with him and his father, as I hear, so
bring about my friendship also with them. Let them come to my house,
that I may with my own hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href=
"#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>give my daughter
Varu&#7751;asen&aacute; to S&uacute;ryaprabha.&rsquo; So grant this
request of my brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; When Rambha made this request,
Chandraprabha granted it, and sent Prahasta and had
Varu&#7751;asen&aacute; brought quickly from the city of
&#346;&aacute;kala to her father Kumbh&iacute;ra. And the next day, he
and S&uacute;ryaprabha and Rambha, and V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a and all,
with their attendants, went to the city of K&aacute;nch&iacute;. And
after they had been met by Kumbh&iacute;ra, they entered the city of
K&aacute;nch&iacute;, as it were the girdle of the earth, full of many
jewels and adorned with excellences.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9529src" href="#xd27e9529" name="xd27e9529src">7</a> There
Kumbh&iacute;ra bestowed his daughter on S&uacute;ryaprabha with the
usual ceremonies, and gave much wealth to the young couple.</p>
<p>And when the marriage had taken place, Prahasta, after taking food,
said to Chandraprabha, who was all joyfulness, in the presence of all,
&ldquo;King, in the country of &#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha I had
an interview with the king of that land; there king K&aacute;ntisena
whom I thus happened to see, said to me&mdash;&lsquo;Let
S&uacute;ryaprabha come to my house with that daughter of mine, whom he
has carried off, I will perform the ceremony for him according to rule.
If he refuses, I will abandon the body, distracted by love for my
daughter.&rsquo; This is what he then said to me, and I have now
mentioned it on the proper occasion.&rdquo; When Prahasta said this,
king Chandraprabha answered, &ldquo;Go then, take
K&aacute;ntimat&iacute; to him, we will go there also.&rdquo; When the
king said this to him, Prahasta went off that moment through the air,
and did as he had commanded. And next morning Chandraprabha and all,
with Kumbh&iacute;ra, went to the land of
&#346;r&iacute;ka&#7751;&#7789;ha in the air-travelling chariot. There
king K&aacute;ntisena came to meet them, and making them enter his
palace, performed the auspicious ceremony of his daughter&rsquo;s
marriage. Then he gave to K&aacute;ntimat&iacute; and
S&uacute;ryaprabha an endless quantity of jewels, which excited the
wonder of the kings.</p>
<p>While they were all remaining there, enjoying all kinds of
pleasures, a messenger came from Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; and
said&mdash;&ldquo;King Janamejaya sends this message to your honours,
&lsquo;My daughter, of the name of Parapush&#7789;&aacute;, has been
carried off by some one lately. And I have found out to-day, that she
has come into the power of S&uacute;ryaprabha, so let him come with her
to my house without fear. I will perform the marriage ceremony
according to rule, and so dismiss him with his wife, otherwise you will
be my enemies, and I shall be yours.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Having thus
delivered his master&rsquo;s message, the ambassador remained silent:
then king Chandraprabha said to them apart&mdash;&ldquo;How can we go
to the house of that king who sends such haughty messages?&rdquo; When
the king&rsquo;s minister named Siddh&aacute;rtha heard that, he said,
&ldquo;Do not entertain wrong notions, king, for he is justified in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>using such language. For that king is very
generous, learned and sprung of a noble race, a hero, one who has
offered the A&#347;vamedha sacrifice, ever unconquered by others. How
can he have spoken anything unbecoming in speaking according to facts?
And as for the enmity which he threatens, he does that now on account
of Indra. So you must go to his house, for he is a king faithful to his
engagements. Nevertheless send some one to find out his
intentions.&rdquo; When they heard this speech of
Siddh&aacute;rtha&rsquo;s, they all approved it. Then king
Chandraprabha sent Prahasta to sound Janamejaya, and honoured his
messenger. And Prahasta went, and after making an agreement with the
king of Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, brought a letter from him, and
satisfied Chandraprabha. The king quickly sent that Prahasta, and had
Parapush&#7789;&aacute; conducted from &#346;&aacute;kala to
Janamejaya. Then Chandraprabha and the other kings, preceded by
S&uacute;ryaprabha,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9543src" href=
"#xd27e9543" name="xd27e9543src">8</a> with K&aacute;ntisena, went to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; in the chariot. There the king Janamejaya
courteously honoured his son-in-law, and his connexion and all the
others, by advancing to meet them, and other ceremonies. And after he
had performed the ceremony of the marriage-rite, he gave five thousand
elephants and one hundred thousand excellent horses, and also five
thousand camels laden with full burdens of jewels, gold, precious
apparel, camphor and aloes-wood. And he made such a feast, that even
the realm of Pluto was exclusively engaged in dancing and music, a
feast in which excellent Br&aacute;hmans were honoured, and all kings
gratified.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the heaven there suddenly became red, as if
indicating that it would soon be dyed crimson with blood. And the sky
suddenly became full of confused hurtling noises, as if terrified at
beholding a hostile army coming in the air. And a mighty wind
immediately began to blow, as if exciting the inhabitants of earth to
war against the wanderers of the air. And immediately a great
Vidy&aacute;dhara army was seen in the air, illuminating with
brightness the circle of the horizon, loud-shouting, impetuous. And in
the midst of it S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others beheld with
astonishment a very handsome heavenly youth. And at that moment the
herald of the Vidy&aacute;dharas proclaimed with a loud voice in front
of that youth, whose name was D&aacute;modara: &ldquo;Victory to the
crown-prince D&aacute;modara son of king &Aacute;sh&aacute;&#7693;ha! O
mortal, dweller on the earth, S&uacute;ryaprabha, fall at his feet. And
do homage, O Janamejaya; why have you given your daughter to an
undeserver? Propitiate, both of you, this god at once, otherwise he
will not be appeased.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this, and
saw that army, he was wroth, and seizing his sword and shield, he flew
up into the heaven by his science. And all his ministers flew up after
him, with their weapons in their hands, Prahasta, and Prabh&aacute;sa,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>and Bh&aacute;sa, and Siddh&aacute;rtha, and
Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya, and Sarvadamana, and V&iacute;tabh&iacute;ti
and &#346;ubhankara. And the Vidy&aacute;dharas fought a great fight
with them. And on one side S&uacute;ryaprabha, and on the other
D&aacute;modara advanced, not slaying their enemies with their swords,
but receiving their weapons on their shields. Those men, few in number,
and those air-roamers, a hundred thousand in number, found equality in
battle, fighting with one another. And all sword-blades there flashed
red with blood, falling on the heads of heroes, like the glances of the
god of death. And the Vidy&aacute;dharas fell on the earth with their
heads and their bodies, in front of Chandraprabha, as if imploring
protection out of fear. S&uacute;ryaprabha shone in the world with the
glory of the Vidy&aacute;dharas which he had seen. The sky was red with
blood, as if with vermilion shed abroad. And S&uacute;ryaprabha at last
reached, and fought face to face with D&aacute;modara, who was armed
with a sword and a shield. And as he fought, he broke through his
enemy&rsquo;s guard by a skilful management of his weapons, and laid
him on the earth, having cleft his shield with his sword. And while he
was preparing to cut off the head of his struggling foe, Vish&#7751;u
came and made a threatening sound in the sky. Then S&uacute;ryaprabha,
having heard that sound, and having beheld Hari, prostrated himself,
and out of respect for the god spared to slay D&aacute;modara. Hari
carried him off somewhere as his votary, and saved him from death, for
the adorable one delivers in this world and the next his faithful
followers. And the troops of D&aacute;modara fled in different
directions. S&uacute;ryaprabha, for his part, descended from heaven to
his father&rsquo;s side. And his father Chandraprabha welcomed him, on
his returning unwounded with his ministers, and the other kings praised
him, now that his valour had been seen.</p>
<p>And while they were all engaged in joyfully talking over the combat,
another ambassador, belonging to Subha&#7789;a, arrived there. And he
came and delivered a letter in the presence of Chandraprabha; and
Siddh&aacute;rtha, opening it, read it out in the assembly: It ran as
follows, &ldquo;The august king Chandraprabha, the pearl-jewel of a
noble race, is thus respectfully solicited by king Subha&#7789;a in the
Concan. We have learnt that our daughter, who was carried off by some
being in the night, has come into the hands of thy son, and we rejoice
thereat. Make an effort, thou and thy son S&uacute;ryaprabha, to come
with her to our house, without raising any objection, in order that we
may behold our daughter, returned as it were from the other world, and
perform for her at once the ceremony required for marriage.&rdquo; When
this letter was read by Siddh&aacute;rtha, the king Chandraprabha,
consenting, welcomed the messenger and rejoiced. And he quickly sent
Prahasta to the western border, and had Subha&#7789;a&rsquo;s daughter
Chandrik&aacute;vat&iacute; conducted into her father&rsquo;s presence.
And the next morning they all went, with S&uacute;ryaprabha in front,
and in company with Janamejaya, in the chariot to the western border.
There king Subha&#7789;a, pleased at recovering his daughter, shewed
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>much honour, and celebrated his daughter&rsquo;s
marriage festival. And he bestowed on Chandrik&aacute;vat&iacute;
jewels and other gifts in such liberal profusion, that
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a and the others were ashamed at what they had
given. Then, while S&uacute;ryaprabha was remaining there in the house
of his father-in-law, there came from L&aacute;v&aacute;naka also an
ambassador belonging to king Paurava. He delivered to Chandraprabha
this message from his master, &ldquo;My daughter Sulochan&aacute; has
been carried off by the fortunate prince S&uacute;ryaprabha: that does
not grieve me; but why should he not be brought with her to my house,
in order that we may perform the marriage ceremony?&rdquo; When king
Chandraprabha heard that, he honoured the messenger in his joy, and had
Sulochan&aacute; escorted by Prahasta into the presence of her father.
Then they, Subha&#7789;a and all, in the company of S&uacute;ryaprabha,
went to <span class="corr" id="xd27e9560" title=
"Source: Lav&aacute;naka">L&aacute;v&aacute;naka</span> in the chariot,
that came as soon as it was thought of. There Paurava performed the
joyful marriage ceremony, and bestowed jewels liberally on
S&uacute;ryaprabha and Sulochan&aacute;, and honoured the kings also.
And while they were remaining there in delight, entertained by the
king, Suroha, the king of China, also sent an ambassador. That king,
like the others, requested by the mouth of the ambassador that, as his
daughter had been carried off, they would come with her to his
palace.</p>
<p>Then king Chandraprabha was delighted, and he had the king of
China&rsquo;s daughter, Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute;, also conducted by
Prahasta to her father&rsquo;s house. And on the next day Chandraprabha
and all went, including Paurava, together with S&uacute;ryaprabha and
his retinue, to the land of China. There the king came out to meet
them, and led them into his own treasure-chamber, and there performed
the marriage ceremony of his daughter. And he gave to
Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute; and S&uacute;ryaprabha an immense quantity of
gold, elephants, horses, jewels and silk garments. And being invited by
Suroha, Chandraprabha and the others continued there for some days in
various enjoyments. And S&uacute;ryaprabha, who was in the prime of
youth, was adorned by that Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9565src" href="#xd27e9565" name="xd27e9565src">9</a> as the
rainy season, when the clouds abound, is adorned by the
lightning-garland.</p>
<p>Thus S&uacute;ryaprabha and his relatives, accompanied by his
various charmers, enjoyed delights here and there in the houses of his
fathers-in-law. Then he took counsel with Siddh&aacute;rtha and his
other ministers, and dismissed one by one to their own lands
<span class="corr" id="xd27e9570" title=
"Source: Virabha&#7789;a">V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a</span> and the other
kings, with numbers of horses, and then took leave of that king Suroha,
and accompanied by his daughter, with his own parents and followers
ascended that chariot Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana, and went triumphant to
his own city of &#346;&aacute;kala. In that city great rejoicing took
place on account of his arrival; in one place there was the occupation
of dancing, in another the delight of music; in one place the amusement
of drinking, in another the toilet-rites <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>of fair-eyed ladies;
in another the voice of bards loud in the praise of him who had
obtained what he desired. Then he had brought his other wives, who had
remained in their fathers&rsquo; houses, and with the stores of
elephants and horses bestowed by their fathers, that were brought with
them, and with the innumerable camels bowed down with burdens full of
various jewels, he displayed in sport the wealth obtained by the
conquest of the world, and aroused the wonder of his subjects.</p>
<p>Then &#346;&aacute;kala, inhabited by that fortunate one, appeared
glorious, as if the chiefs of the gods, of the followers of Kuvera, and
of the snakes, had made in it many deposits of much wealth. Then
S&uacute;ryaprabha dwelt there with Madanasen&aacute;, enjoying the
pleasures he desired, happy in that all blessings were fully bestowed
upon him, in the society of his parents, with his ministers,
accompanied by his other wives, expecting every day Maya, who had made
a promise to return.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then, one day, when king Chandraprabha was in the hall
of assembly, and S&uacute;ryaprabha was there accompanied by all his
ministers, they called to mind Maya <i>&agrave; propos</i> of a remark
made by Siddh&aacute;rtha, and suddenly the earth cleft open in the
middle of the assembly. Then first a loud-sounding fragrant breeze
ascended from the aperture in the earth, and afterwards the Asura Maya
rose up from it, looking like a mountain in the night, for his hair
gleamed upon his black lofty head like the potent herbs upon the
mountain peaks, and his crimson robe resembled the flowing streams of
cinnabar. And the king of the D&aacute;navas, after having been duly
honoured by king Chandraprabha, spake from his seat on a jewelled
throne&mdash;&ldquo;You have enjoyed these delights of earth, and now
it is time for you to enjoy others; set yourselves now to prepare for
acquiring them. Send out ambassadors, and collect your subordinate
kings, and your friends and connexions; then we will unite with Sumeru,
prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and we will conquer
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, and win the sovereignty of the sky-goers. And
Sumeru is our ally, considering us as friends, for he received at the
outset a command from &#346;iva, to support S&uacute;ryaprabha and give
him his own daughter. When the Asura Maya said this, Chandraprabha
sent, as ambassadors to all the kings, Prahasta and the other ministers
that travelled through the air; and, by the advice of Maya,
S&uacute;ryaprabha communicated the magic sciences to all his wives and
ministers, on whom they had not been bestowed already. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span></p>
<p>And while they were thus engaged, the hermit N&aacute;rada arrived,
descending from the sky, illuminating the whole horizon with
brightness. And after he had received the <i lang="sa-latn">argha</i>,
he sat down and said to Chandraprabha, &ldquo;I am sent here by Indra,
and he sends this message to your Highness&mdash;&lsquo;I have learned
that, by the instigation of &#346;iva, you purpose, with the assistance
of the Asura Maya, being all of you deluded by ignorance, to obtain for
this S&uacute;ryaprabha, of mortal frame, the great dignity of emperor
of all the chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas: that is improper, for I
have conferred it on &#346;ruta&#347;arman, and besides it is the
hereditary right of that moon of the sea of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race.
And as for what you are doing in a spirit of opposition to me, and
contrary to what is right, it will certainly result in your
destruction. Moreover, before, when your Highness was offering a
sacrifice to Rudra, I told you first to offer an A&#347;vamedha
sacrifice, but you did not do it. So the haughty enterprise you are
engaged in, without regard to the gods, relying upon &#346;iva alone,
will not turn out to your happiness.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When
N&aacute;rada had delivered in these words the message of Indra, Maya
laughed and said to him; &ldquo;Great hermit, the king of gods has not
spoken well. For what he says about the fact of S&uacute;ryaprabha
being a mortal is beside the point; for who was not aware of that fact,
when he met D&aacute;modara in fight? For mortals who possess courage
can obtain all powers. Did not Nahusha and others of old time obtain
the dignity of Indra? And as for his saying that he bestowed the empire
on &#346;ruta&#347;arman, and that it is his hereditary right, that
also is absurd, for where &#346;iva is the giver, who has any
authority? Besides, did not he himself take away the sovereignty of the
gods from Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha, though it descended to him as the
elder? And as for his other remark about opposition, and our acting
contrary to what is right, that is false, for he violently puts himself
in opposition to us out of selfish motives, and wherein, pray, are we
acting contrary to what is right, for we are only striving to conquer
our rival, we are not carrying off a hermit&rsquo;s wife, we are not
killing Br&aacute;hmans? And what he says about the necessity of first
performing an A&#347;vamedha sacrifice, and about contempt of the gods,
is untrue, for when sacrifice to &#346;iva has been performed, what
need is there of other sacrifices?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9592src"
href="#xd27e9592" name="xd27e9592src">1</a> And when &#346;iva the god
of gods is worshipped, what god is not worshipped? And as for his
remark that exclusive attention to Rudra<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9595src" href="#xd27e9595" name="xd27e9595src">2</a> is not
becoming, I answer&mdash;Of what importance are the hosts of the other
gods, where &#346;iva is in arms? When the sun has risen, do the other
luminaries give light? So you must tell all this to the king of the
gods, O hermit, and we shall continue to carry out what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>we
are engaged in, let him do what he can.&rdquo; When the
<i>&#7771;ishi</i> N&aacute;rada had been thus addressed by the Asura
Maya, he said &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; and took back to the king of
the gods that answer to his message. When that hermit had departed, the
Asura Maya thus spake to king Chandraprabha, who was apprehensive on
account of the message of Indra, &ldquo;You must not be afraid of
Indra; even if he is on the side of &#346;ruta&#347;arman in fight,
with the hosts of the gods, out of hostility to us, still we Daityas
and D&aacute;navas are countless in number, and under the leadership of
Prahl&aacute;da we are ranged together on your side. And if the
destroyer of Tripura<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9606src" href=
"#xd27e9606" name="xd27e9606src">3</a> favours us and is active on our
side, what other miserable creature in the three worlds has any power?
So set about this expedition, heroes.&rdquo; When Maya said this, all
those there were pleased, and considered that it was as he said.</p>
<p>Then in accordance with the messages carried by the ambassadors, in
course of time all the kings, V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a and the others,
assembled there, and all the other friends and relatives of
Chandraprabha. When these kings with their armies had been duly
honoured, the Asura Maya again said to Chandraprabha, &ldquo;Perform
to-night, O king, a great sacrifice in honour of &#346;iva; afterwards
you shall do all as I direct.&rdquo; When he heard this speech of
Maya&rsquo;s, king Chandraprabha immediately had preparations made for
a sacrifice to &#346;iva. Then he went to the forest at night, and
under the instructions of Maya, himself performed devoutly a sacrifice
to Rudra. And while the king was engaged in the fire-offering, there
suddenly appeared there Nandin the prince of the host of Bh&uacute;tas.
He was honoured duly by the delighted king, and said&mdash;&ldquo;The
god &#346;iva himself sends this command by me, &lsquo;Through my
favour thou needst not fear even a hundred Indras; S&uacute;ryaprabha
shall become emperor of the sky-goers.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; After he
had delivered this message, Nandin received a portion of the offering
and disappeared with the hosts of Bh&uacute;tas. Then Chandraprabha
became confident in the future elevation of his son, and after
completing the sacrifice, at the end of the fire-offering, re-entered
the city with Maya.</p>
<p>And the next morning, when king Chandraprabha was sitting in secret
conclave together with the queen, his son, the kings and his ministers,
the Asura Maya said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, king, I will to-day
tell you a secret long guarded; you are a D&aacute;nava, Sun&iacute;tha
by name, my mighty son, and S&uacute;ryaprabha is your younger brother,
named Sumund&iacute;ka; after you were slain in the war of the gods,
you were born here as father and son. That D&aacute;nava body of yours
has been preserved by me skilfully embalmed with heavenly drugs and
ghee. Therefore you must enter a cavern and visit P&aacute;t&aacute;la,
and then return to your own body by a charm which I will teach you. And
when you have entered that body, you will be so much superior in spirit
and strength, that you will conquer in fight the wanderers of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>air. But S&uacute;ryaprabha, who is an
incarnation of Sumund&iacute;ka, with this same beautiful body which he
now possesses, shall soon become lord of the sky-goers. When king
Chandraprabha heard this from Maya, he was delighted and agreed to it,
but Siddh&aacute;rtha said this&mdash;&ldquo;O excellent D&aacute;nava,
what ground of confidence have we, if this doubt should arise,
&lsquo;Why has the king entered another body, has he then died?&rsquo;
And moreover will he forget us when he enters another body, like a man
gone to the other world? Who is he, and who are we?&rdquo; When the
Asura Maya heard this speech of Siddh&aacute;rtha&rsquo;s, he
answered&mdash;&ldquo;You yourselves must come and see him with your
own eyes entering another body, of his own free will, by the employment
of a charm. And hear the reason why he will not forget you. A man, who
does not die of his own free will, and is born in another womb, does
not remember anything, as his memory is destroyed by old age and other
afflictions, but whoever of his own free will enters another body,
penetrating by the employment of magic the internal organ and the
senses, without his mind and intellect being impaired, and passes, as
it were, from one house to another, that prince among <i>Yogins</i> has
supernatural knowledge and remembers all. So do not feel doubtful; so
far from there being any reason for it, this king will obtain a great
divine body free from old age and sickness. Moreover you are all
D&aacute;navas, and by merely entering Ras&aacute;tala,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9620src" href="#xd27e9620" name="xd27e9620src">4</a>
and drinking nectar, you will obtain divine bodies free from
sickness.&rdquo; When the ministers heard this speech of Maya&rsquo;s,
they all said, &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and consented to his proposal,
abandoning their apprehensions out of the confidence they reposed in
him. And by his advice, Chandraprabha, with all the kings, went on the
next day to the confluence of the Chandrabh&aacute;g&aacute; and the
Air&aacute;vat&iacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9623src" href=
"#xd27e9623" name="xd27e9623src">5</a> There Chandraprabha left the
kings outside, and committed to their care the wives of
S&uacute;ryaprabha, and then he entered in company with
S&uacute;ryaprabha, the queen, and the ministers with Siddh&aacute;rtha
at their head, an opening in the water pointed out by Maya, and after
entering he travelled a long distance, and beheld a heavenly temple,
and entered it with all of them.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the Vidy&aacute;dharas descended with troops on
those kings, who were remaining there outside the opening; and
paralyzing the kings by supernatural arts, they carried off the wives
of S&uacute;ryaprabha, and immediately a voice was heard from the
sky&mdash;&ldquo;Wicked &#346;ruta&#347;arman, if you touch these wives
of the emperor, you shall immediately perish with your host. So guard
them respectfully, treating them like your mother; there is a reason
for my not immediately slaying you and setting them free; so let them
remain as they are at present.&rdquo; And when the kings,
V&iacute;rabha&#7789;a and the others, saw them carried off, they
prepared to die by fighting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=
"#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>with one another. But a voice from
heaven forbade their attempt, saying, &ldquo;No harm will befall these
daughters of yours, you shall obtain them again, so you must not act
rashly, prosperity befall you!&rdquo; So the kings remained waiting
there. In the meantime Chandraprabha was in the temple in
P&aacute;t&aacute;la surrounded by all his companions, and there Maya
said to him, &ldquo;King, listen attentively to this wonderful thing; I
will shew you the supernatural art of entering another body.&rdquo; He
said this, and recited the S&aacute;nkhya and the Yoga doctrine with
its secrets, and taught him the magic art of entering another body; and
that chief of Yogins said&mdash;&ldquo;This is the famous supernatural
power, and the independence of knowledge, the dominion over matter that
is characterized by lightness and the other mystic properties. The
chief of the gods, possessing this power, do not long for liberation;
in order to obtain this power others endure the hardship of muttering
prayers and performing asceticism. Men of lofty soul do not love the
pleasures of heaven even when attained. And listen, I will tell you a
story in illustration of this.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman K&aacute;la.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a former Kalpa<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9637src"
href="#xd27e9637" name="xd27e9637src">6</a> there was a certain
Br&aacute;hman, of the name of K&aacute;la. He went to the holy
bathing-place Pushkara and muttered prayers day and night. While he was
muttering, two myriads of years of the gods passed away. Then there
appeared a great light inseparable from his head, which, streaming
forth in the firmament like ten thousand suns,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9642src" href="#xd27e9642" name="xd27e9642src">7</a> impeded the
movement of the Siddhas and others there, and set the three worlds on
fire. Then Brahm&aacute;, Indra and the other gods came to him and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, these worlds are on fire with your
brightness. Receive whatever boon you desire.&rdquo; He answered
them&mdash;&ldquo;Let me have no other pleasure than muttering prayers,
this is my boon, I choose nothing else.&rdquo; When they importuned
him, that mutterer of prayers went far off and remained on the north
side of the Him&aacute;layas, muttering prayers. When this
extraordinary brightness of his gradually became intolerable even
there, Indra sent heavenly nymphs to tempt him. That self-restrained
man did not care a straw about them, when they endeavoured to seduce
him. Then the gods sent him Death as plenipotentiary. He came to him
and said&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, mortals do not live so long, so
abandon your life; do not break the law of nature.&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;If the limit of my life
is attained, why do you not take me? What are you waiting for? But I
will not of myself abandon my life, O thou god with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span>the
noose in hand; indeed, if I were wilfully to abandon my life, I should
be a self-murderer.&rdquo; When he said this, and Death found that he
could not take him on account of his power, he turned away from him and
returned as he came. Then Indra repenting seized that
K&aacute;la,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9655src" href="#xd27e9655"
name="xd27e9655src">8</a> who had conquered Time the destroyer, in his
arms, and took him up to heaven by force. There he remained averse to
the sensual enjoyments of the place, and he did not cease from
muttering prayers, so the gods made him descend again, and he returned
to the Him&aacute;layas. And while all the gods were trying to induce
him there to take a boon, the king Ikshv&aacute;ku came that way. When
he heard how affairs stood, he said to that mutterer of prayers,
&ldquo;If you will not receive a boon from the gods, receive one from
me.&rdquo; When the mutterer of prayers heard that, he laughed, and
said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;Are you able to grant me a boon, when I
will not receive one even from the gods?&rdquo; Thus he spoke, and
Ikshv&aacute;ku answered the Br&aacute;hman&mdash;&ldquo;If I am not
able to grant you a boon, you can grant me one; so grant me a
boon.&rdquo; Then the mutterer said&mdash;&ldquo;Choose whatever you
desire, and I will grant it.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he
reflected in his mind: &ldquo;The appointed order is that I should
give, and that he should receive; this is an inversion of the due
order, that I should receive what he gives.&rdquo; Whilst the king was
delaying, as he pondered over this difficulty, two Br&aacute;hmans came
there disputing; when they saw the king they appealed to him for a
decision. The first said, &ldquo;This Br&aacute;hman gave me a cow with
a sacrificial fee: why will he not receive it from my hand, when I
offer to give it back to him?&rdquo; Then the other said, &ldquo;I did
not receive it first, and I did not ask for it, then why does he wish
to make me receive it by force?&rdquo; When the king heard this, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;This complainant is not in the right; why, after
receiving the cow, do you try to compel the man, who gave it, to take
it back from you?&rdquo; When the king said this, Indra, having found
his opportunity, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;King, if you hold this view
of what is right, then, after you have asked the Br&aacute;hman, who
mutters prayers, for a boon, why do you not take it from him when it is
granted?&rdquo; Then the king, being at a loss for an answer, said to
that muttering Br&aacute;hman&mdash;&ldquo;Revered sir, give me the
fruit of half your muttering as a boon.&rdquo; Then the muttering
Br&aacute;hman said&mdash;&ldquo;Very well, receive the fruit of half
my muttering,&rdquo; and so he gave the king a boon. By means of that
boon the king obtained access to all the worlds, and that muttering
Br&aacute;hman obtained the world of the gods called
&#346;ivas.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9660src" href="#xd27e9660" name=
"xd27e9660src">9</a> There he remained for many <i>kalpas</i>, and then
returned to earth, and by mystic contemplation obtained independence,
and gained everlasting supernatural power. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus this supernatural power is desired by wise men, who are
averse to heaven and such low enjoyments; and you have obtained it, O
king, so, being independent, enter your own body.&rdquo; When Maya said
this to king Chandraprabha, after communicating to him the doctrine of
mystic contemplation giving supernatural power,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9676src" href="#xd27e9676" name="xd27e9676src">10</a> he and his
wife and his son and his ministers rejoiced exceedingly.</p>
<p>Then the king, with his son and companions, was led by Maya to a
second under-world, and made to enter a splendid city. And there they
saw a gigantic hero, reclining at full length upon a beautiful couch,
as if asleep, anointed with potent herbs and ghee, awful from the
ghastly transformation of his features, surrounded by the daughters of
the kings of the Daityas, with their lotus-faces full of melancholy.
Then Maya said to Chandraprabha:&mdash;&ldquo;This is your body,
surrounded by your former brides, enter it.&rdquo;&mdash;The king had
recourse to the magic contemplation taught by Maya, and entered the
body of that hero, abandoning his own frame.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9683src" href="#xd27e9683" name="xd27e9683src">11</a> Then the
hero yawned slowly, opened his eyes, and rose up from the bed, as if
awaking out of sleep. Then a shout arose from the delighted Asura
brides, &ldquo;Happy are we, that our husband, the god Sun&iacute;tha,
is to-day restored to life.&rdquo; But S&uacute;ryaprabha and the
others were immediately despondent, beholding the body of Chandraprabha
lying lifeless. But Chandraprabha-Sun&iacute;tha, appearing as if risen
from a refreshing sleep, saw Maya, and falling at his feet honoured his
father. That father too embraced him and asked him in the presence of
all,&mdash;&ldquo;Do you remember both your lives, my son?&rdquo; He
said; &ldquo;I do remember them,&rdquo; and related what had happened
to him in his life as Chandraprabha, and also what had happened to him
in his life as Sun&iacute;tha, and he comforted one by one
S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, and also his queens, mentioning each
by name, and also the D&aacute;nava ladies, his wives in his first
life. And he preserved the body, which he had as Chandraprabha,
carefully laid by, embalmed by means of drugs and ghee, saying,
&ldquo;It may possibly be useful to me.&rdquo; Then S&uacute;ryaprabha
and the others, tranquil now that they had gained confidence, bowed
before him, and joyfully congratulated him.</p>
<p>Then Maya, having conducted all of them in high delight out of that
city, led them to another city adorned with gold and jewels. When they
entered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>it, they beheld a lake of the appearance of
beryl, filled with nectar, and they all sat down on the bank of it. And
they drank that nectarous draught there, more excellent than the water
of life, in curiously ornamented cups formed of jewels, which were
brought to them by the wives of Sun&iacute;tha. And by that draught
they all rose up, as from a sleep of intoxication, and became possessed
of divine bodies, and of great strength and courage.</p>
<p>Then the Asura Maya said to Chandraprabha-Sun&iacute;tha,
&ldquo;Come, my son, let us go, and see your mother after so long a
separation.&rdquo; And Sun&iacute;tha said &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and
prepared to go conducted by Maya, and so proceeded to the fourth
under-world with S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others. There they beheld
curious cities made of various metals, and at last they all reached a
city built entirely of gold. There, on a pillar composed of jewels
adorned with every luxury, they beheld that mother of Sun&iacute;tha,
the wife of Maya, by name L&iacute;l&aacute;vat&iacute;, surpassing in
beauty the nymphs of heaven, surrounded with Asura maidens, and adorned
with all ornaments. The moment she beheld that Sun&iacute;tha, she rose
up in a state of excitement, and Sun&iacute;tha, after saluting her,
fell at her feet. Then she embraced with gushing tears the son, whom
she once more held in her arms after so long an interval, and again
praised her husband Maya, who was the cause of her regaining him. Then
Maya said&mdash;&ldquo;Queen, your other son Sumund&iacute;ka has been
born again as the son of your son, and here he is, S&uacute;ryaprabha
by name. He has been appointed by the god &#346;iva the future emperor
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and is destined to rule over them in the
body which he now possesses.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this,
and saw her look at him with an eye of longing affection, he and his
ministers fell at her feet. And L&iacute;l&aacute;vat&iacute; gave him
her blessing, and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;My darling, you do not
require the body of Sumund&iacute;ka, in this you are sufficiently
glorious.&rdquo; When his sons were thus triumphant, Maya called to
mind his daughter Mandodar&iacute;, and Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a, and
when called to mind, they came. And Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a, welcomed
with triumphant rejoicings, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;O prince of the
D&aacute;navas, if you will listen to my advice, I will give it you.
You are among the D&aacute;navas singularly virtuous and prosperous, so
you ought not to take up a causeless enmity against the gods. For you
will gain nothing but death from your hostility to them. For Asuras
have been slain in battle by the gods, but not gods by Asuras.&rdquo;
When Maya heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;We are not forcing on war,
but if Indra violently makes war on us, tell me, how can we remain
passive? And as for those Asuras who were slain by the gods, they were
reckless, but did the gods slay Bali and others who were not
infatuated?&rdquo; That king of the R&aacute;kshasas having, with his
wife Mandodar&iacute;, been addressed with these and similar speeches
by Maya, took leave of him, and went to his own dwelling.</p>
<p>Then Sun&iacute;tha, with S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, was
conducted to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422"
name="pb422">422</a>]</span>third under-world to visit king Bali. In
that world, which surpassed even heaven, they all beheld Bali, adorned
with chain and tiara, surrounded with Daityas and D&aacute;navas.
Sun&iacute;tha and his companions fell at his feet in due order, and he
honoured them with appropriate welcome. And Bali was delighted with the
tidings related by Maya, and he quickly had summoned Prahl&aacute;da
and the other D&aacute;navas. Sun&iacute;tha and the others honoured
them also by falling at their feet, and they, being full of joy,
congratulated them, as they bent before them. Then Bali said,
&ldquo;Sun&iacute;tha became Chandraprabha on the earth, and now is
restored to life for us by regaining his body. And we have also gained
S&uacute;ryaprabha, who is an incarnation of Sumund&iacute;ka. And he
has been appointed by &#346;iva the future emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas: and by the power of the sacrifice offered by
Chandraprabha my bonds have been relaxed. So without doubt we have
gained prosperity by recovering these.&rdquo; When &#346;ukra, the
spiritual adviser of the D&aacute;navas, heard this speech of
Bali&rsquo;s, he said, &ldquo;In truth those who act according to right
never fail of prosperity in any matter; so act according to right, and
do on this occasion also what I bid you.&rdquo; When the
D&aacute;navas, the princes of the seven under-worlds, who were
assembled there, heard that, they agreed to it and bound themselves so
to act. And Bali made a feast there, out of joy at the recovery of
Sun&iacute;tha.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the hermit N&aacute;rada arrived there again, and
after taking the <i lang="sa-latn">argha</i>, he sat down, and said to
those D&aacute;navas, &ldquo;I have been sent here by Indra, and he in
truth says this to you, &lsquo;I am exceedingly delighted at the fact
that Sun&iacute;tha has come back to life; so you must not take up a
causeless enmity against me, and you must not fight against my ally
&#346;ruta&#347;arman.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the hermit had thus
delivered Indra&rsquo;s message, Prahl&aacute;da said to him, &ldquo;Of
course Indra is pleased that Sun&iacute;tha has come back to life, how
could it be otherwise? But we at any rate are not taking up causeless
hostility. This very day we all took an engagement that we would not do
so, in the presence of our spiritual adviser. But if Indra makes
himself a partizan<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9701src" href=
"#xd27e9701" name="xd27e9701src">12</a> of &#346;ruta&#347;arman, and
violently opposes us, how are we to be blamed for it? For
S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s ally, &#346;iva, the god of gods, has long
ago appointed him, because he propitiated him first. So what have we to
do with this matter which has been settled by the lord &#346;iva? It is
clear that this, which Indra says, is without cause, and not
right.&rdquo; When Prahl&aacute;da, the king of the D&aacute;navas said
this to N&aacute;rada, he blamed Indra by expressing his agreement with
it, and disappeared. When he had gone, U&#347;anas<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9707src" href="#xd27e9707" name="xd27e9707src">13</a> said to
the kings of the D&aacute;navas&mdash;&ldquo;Indra is evidently
determined to oppose us in this matter. But, as &#346;iva has decidedly
girded up his loins to shew us favour, what is his power, or what will
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>reliance upon Vish&#7751;u do?&rdquo; The
D&aacute;navas heard and approved this speech of &#346;ukra&rsquo;s,
and taking leave of Bali and Prahl&aacute;da, went to their own homes.
Then Prahl&aacute;da went to the fourth under-world, his habitation,
and king Bali, rising up from the assembly, retired within. And Maya
and Sun&iacute;tha and the others, S&uacute;ryaprabha and all, bowed
before Bali, and went to their own habitations. After they had eaten
and drunk there sufficiently, L&iacute;l&aacute;vat&iacute;, the mother
of Sun&iacute;tha, came to him and said, &ldquo;My son, you know that
these wives of yours are the daughters of mighty ones, Tejasvat&iacute;
being the daughter of the god of wealth, Mangal&aacute;vat&iacute; of
Tumburu; and as for K&iacute;rtimat&iacute;, that wife that you married
in your existence as Chandraprabha, her you know to be the daughter of
the Vasu Prabh&aacute;va, so you must look upon these three with an
equal eye, my son.&rdquo; After saying this, she commended to him his
three principal wives. Then, that night, Sun&iacute;tha entered his
sleeping apartment with the eldest, Tejasvat&iacute;.</p>
<p>But S&uacute;ryaprabha, in another chamber, with his ministers,
reclined on a couch without any of his wives that night. And the
goddess of sleep did not come to him, who remained continually alone,
saying to herself, &ldquo;What is the use of this unloving man, who
leaves his wives outside?&rdquo; And she would not approach Prahasta
out of jealousy, as he was so exclusively in love with the cares of his
official duties, but the other ministers around S&uacute;ryaprabha went
to sleep comfortably. In the meanwhile S&uacute;ryaprabha and Prahasta
beheld an incomparable maiden entering, accompanied by a female friend.
She was so beautiful that Providence seemed, after creating her, to
have placed her in the lower regions in order that the nymphs of
heaven, also his creation, might not be eclipsed by her. And while
S&uacute;ryaprabha was debating who she might be, she approached each
of his friends, one by one, and looked at them; and as they did not
possess the distinguishing marks of emperors, she left them, and seeing
that S&uacute;ryaprabha possessed them, she approached him, who was
lying in the midst of them; and she said to her
friend&mdash;&ldquo;Here he is, my friend; so touch him on the feet,
wake him up with those hands of yours cool as water.&rdquo; When her
friend heard that, she did so, and S&uacute;ryaprabha ceased to feign
sleep, and opened his eyes, and beholding those maidens, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;Who are you, and why do you come here?&rdquo; When
the friend of the lady heard that, she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Listen,
king, in the second under-world there is a victorious king named
Am&iacute;la, a chieftain of the Daityas, the son of
Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha; this is his daughter Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;
whom he loves more than life. Her father came back to-day from the
court of Bali, and said&mdash;&lsquo;I am fortunate in that I have
to-day beheld Sun&iacute;tha once more restored to life; and I have
also seen the young man S&uacute;ryaprabha, an incarnation of
Sumund&iacute;ka, who has been brought into the world by &#346;iva as
the future emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. So I will now offer a
congratulatory tribute to Sun&iacute;tha,&mdash;&mdash;I will give my
daughter Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424"
href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>S&uacute;ryaprabha, for she
cannot be given to Sun&iacute;tha because she belongs to the same
family; but S&uacute;ryaprabha is his son in his birth as a king, not
in his birth as an Asura, and any honour paid to his son will be paid
to him.&rsquo; When my friend heard this speech of her father&rsquo;s,
her mind being attracted by your virtues, she came here out of a
curiosity to see you.&rdquo; When that friend of the lady&rsquo;s said
this, S&uacute;ryaprabha pretended to be asleep in order to discover
the real object of her wish. The maiden slowly approached the sleepless
Prahasta, and after telling him all by the mouth of her friend, went
out. And Prahasta advanced towards S&uacute;ryaprabha and
said&mdash;&ldquo;King, are you awake or not?&rdquo; And he, opening
his eyes, said to him, &ldquo;My friend, I am awake, for how could I
sleep to-day being alone? But I will tell you a strange fact; listen,
for what can I hide from you? I saw a moment ago a maiden enter here
with her friend; her equal is not beheld in these three worlds. And she
departed in a moment, taking my heart with her. So look for her at
once, for she must be somewhere hereabout.&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha said this to him, Prahasta went out, and seeing the
maiden there with her friend, he said to her&mdash;&ldquo;I, to please
you, have again woke up my master here, so you, to please me, must once
more grant him an interview. Behold once more his form that gives
satisfaction to your eyes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9716src" href=
"#xd27e9716" name="xd27e9716src">14</a> and let him, who was
overpowered by you as soon as he saw you, behold you again. For when he
woke up, he said to me speaking of you, &lsquo;Bring her from some
place or other, and shew her to me, otherwise I cannot survive.&rsquo;
Then I came to you, so come and behold him yourself.&rdquo; When she
was thus addressed by Prahasta, she hesitated to go in boldly, owing to
the modesty natural to a maiden, and reflected, and then Prahasta,
seizing her hand, led her into the presence of S&uacute;ryaprabha. And
S&uacute;ryaprabha, when he saw that Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; had come
near him, said&mdash;&ldquo;Fair one, was this right of you to come in
to-day and steal away my heart, as you did, when I was asleep? So,
thief, I will not leave you unpunished to-day.&rdquo; When her sly
friend heard this, she said to him; &ldquo;Since her father knew of it
before, and determined to assign this thief to you for punishment, who
can forbid you to punish her. Why do you not inflict on her to your
heart&rsquo;s content the punishment due for thieving?&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha heard that, he wanted to embrace her, but
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; being modest, said, &ldquo;Do not, my husband, I
am a maiden.&rdquo; Then Prahasta said to her; &ldquo;Do not hesitate,
my queen, for the G&aacute;ndharva marriage is the best of all
marriages in the world.&rdquo; When Prahasta had said this, he went out
with all the rest, and S&uacute;ryaprabha that very moment made
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, the maiden of the under-world, his wife.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>And when the night came to an end, Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; went to
her own dwelling, and S&uacute;ryaprabha went to Sun&iacute;tha and
Maya. They all assembled and went into the presence of Prahl&aacute;da,
and he, seated in the hall of audience, after honouring them
appropriately, said to Maya: &ldquo;We must do something to please
Sun&iacute;tha on this day of rejoicing, so let us all feast
together.&rdquo; Maya said&mdash;&ldquo;Let us do so, what harm is
there in this?&rdquo; And then Prahl&aacute;da invited by means of
messengers the chiefs of the Asuras, and they came there in order from
all the under-worlds. First came king Bali accompanied by innumerable
great Asuras. Close behind him came Am&iacute;la and the brave
Dur&aacute;roha and Sum&aacute;ya, and Tantukachchha, and
Vika&#7789;&aacute;ksha and Prakampana, and Dh&uacute;maketu and
Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya, and the other lords of the Asuras; each of
these came accompanied by a thousand feudal chiefs. The hall of
audience was filled with the heroes who saluted one another, and after
they had sat down in order of rank, Prahl&aacute;da honoured them all.
And when the time of eating arrived, they all, with Maya and the
others, after bathing in the Ganges, went to a great hall to dine. It
was a hundred <i>yojanas</i> wide, and had a pavement of gold and
jewels, and was adorned with jewelled pillars, and full of curiously
wrought jewelled vessels. There the Asuras, in the company of
Prahl&aacute;da, and with Sun&iacute;tha and Maya, and with
S&uacute;ryaprabha accompanied by his ministers, ate heavenly food of
various kinds, containing all the six flavours, solid, liquid, and
sweetmeats, and then drank the best of wine. And after they had eaten
and drunk, they all went to another hall, which was made of jewels, and
beheld the skilful dance of the Daitya and D&aacute;nava maidens. On
that occasion S&uacute;ryaprabha beheld the daughter of
Prahl&aacute;da, named Mahallik&aacute;, who came forward to dance by
order of her father. She illuminated the world with her beauty, rained
nectar into his eyes, and seemed like the moon-goddess<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9734src" href="#xd27e9734" name=
"xd27e9734src">15</a> come to the under-world out of curiosity. She had
her forehead ornamented with a patch, beautiful anklets on her feet,
and a smiling face, and seemed as if all made of dancing by the
Creator. With her curling hair, her pointed teeth, and her breasts that
filled up the whole of her chest, she seemed as it were to be creating
a new style of dance. And that fair one, the moment she was beheld by
S&uacute;ryaprabha, forcibly robbed him of his heart, though it was
claimed by others. Then she also beheld him from a distance, sitting
among the Asura princes, like a second god of Love made by the Creator,
when the first god of love had been burnt up by &#346;iva. And when she
saw him, her mind was so absorbed in him, that her skill in the
expression of sentiments by gesture forsook her, as if in anger at
beholding her want of modesty. And the spectators beheld the emotion of
those two, and brought the spectacle to an end, saying, &ldquo;The
princess <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>is tired.&rdquo; Then Mahallik&aacute; was
dismissed by her father, looking askance at S&uacute;ryaprabha, and
after she had bowed before the princes of the Daityas, she went home.
And the princes of the Daityas went to their respective houses, and
S&uacute;ryaprabha too went to his dwelling at the close of day.</p>
<p>And when the night came, Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; again came to visit
him, and he slept secretly within with her, with all his followers
sleeping outside. In the meanwhile Mahallik&aacute; also came there,
eager to see him, accompanied by two confidantes. Then a minister of
S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s, named Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya, who happened
at that moment to have his eyes forsaken by sleep, saw her attempting
to enter. And he, recognising her, rose up and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Princess, remain here a moment until I enter and come
out again.&rdquo; She alarmed, said&mdash;&ldquo;Why are we stopped,
and why are you outside?&rdquo; Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya again said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;Why do you enter in this sudden way when a man is
sleeping at his ease? Besides, my lord sleeps alone to-night on account
of a vow.&rdquo; Then the daughter of Prahl&aacute;da, being ashamed,
said, &ldquo;So be it, enter,&rdquo; and Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya went
inside. Seeing that Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; was asleep, he woke up
S&uacute;ryaprabha and himself told him that Mahallik&aacute; had
arrived. And S&uacute;ryaprabha, hearing of it, gently rose up, and
went out, and beholding Mahallik&aacute; with two others, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;This person has been supremely blessed by your
arrival, let this place be blessed also, take a seat.&rdquo; When
Mahallik&aacute; heard this, she sat down with her friends, and
S&uacute;ryaprabha also sat down, with Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya by his
side. And when he sat down, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Fair one, although you
shewed contempt for me by seeming to look on others in the assembly
with respect, nevertheless, O rolling-eyed one, my eyes were blessed as
soon as they beheld your dancing as well as your beauty.&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha said this, the daughter of Prahl&aacute;da answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;This is not my fault, noble sir,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9741src" href="#xd27e9741" name="xd27e9741src">16</a> he is in
fault, who made me ashamed in the hall of assembly by putting me beside
my part in the pantomime.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this, he
laughed and said&mdash;&ldquo;I am conquered.&rdquo; And then that
prince seized her hand with his, and it perspired and trembled, as if
afraid of the rough seizure. And she said&mdash;&ldquo;Let me go, noble
sir, I am a maiden under my father&rsquo;s control,&rdquo;&mdash;then
Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya said to that daughter of the chief of the
Asuras, &ldquo;Is not there not such a thing as the G&aacute;ndharva
marriage of maidens? And your father, who has seen your heart, will not
give you to another, moreover he will certainly do some honour to this
prince here; so away with timidity! Let not such a meeting be thrown
away!&rdquo; While Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya was saying this to
Mahallik&aacute;, Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; woke up within. And not seeing
S&uacute;ryaprabha on the bed, after waiting a long time, she was
terrified and apprehensive and went out. And seeing her lover in the
company of Mahallik&aacute;, she was angry and ashamed and terrified.
Mahallik&aacute; too, when she saw her, was terrified and angry and
ashamed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>and S&uacute;ryaprabha stood motionless like a
painted picture. Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; came to his side,
thinking&mdash;&ldquo;Now that I have been seen, how can I escape,
shall I display shame or jealousy?<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> And she said with a spiteful intonation
to Mahallik&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;How are you, my friend, how comes it
that you have come here at night?&rdquo; Then Mahallik&aacute;
said&mdash;&ldquo;This is my house; as you have arrived here from
another mansion of the under-world, you are to-day my guest
here.&rdquo; When Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; heard that, she laughed and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, it is clearly the case that you entertain with
appropriate hospitality every guest, as soon as he arrives here.&rdquo;
When Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; said this, Mahallik&aacute;
answered&mdash;&ldquo;When I spoke to you kindly, why do you answer in
such an unkind and spiteful way, shameless girl? Am I like you? Did I,
without being bestowed in marriage by my parents, come from a distance,
and in a strange place sleep in the bed of a strange man alone at
night? I came to see my father&rsquo;s guest, as he was going away, in
accordance with the duty of hospitality, a moment ago, accompanied by
two female friends. When this minister entered, after first reproaching
me, I guessed the real state of the case; you have now of yourself
revealed it.&rdquo; When thus addressed by Mahallik&aacute;,
Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; departed, looking askance at her beloved with an
eye red with anger. Then Mahallik&aacute; too said to
S&uacute;ryaprabha in wrath, &ldquo;Now I will depart, man of many
favourites,&rdquo; and went away. And S&uacute;ryaprabha remained in
heartless despondency, as was reasonable, for his heart, devoted to his
loved ones, went with them.</p>
<p>Then he woke up his minister Prabh&aacute;sa, and sent him to
discover what Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; had done, after she had separated
from him in anger; and in the meanwhile he sent Prahasta to find out
about Mahallik&aacute;, and he remained with Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya
awaiting their report. Then Prabh&aacute;sa returned from investigating
the proceedings of Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, and being questioned, he
said as follows: &ldquo;From this place I went to the private apartment
of Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; in the second under-world, concealing myself
by my science. And outside it I heard the conversation of two maids.
The one said, &lsquo;My friend, why is Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;
distressed to-day?&rsquo; Then the second said&mdash;&lsquo;My friend,
hear the reason. There is at present in the fourth under-world an
incarnation of Sumund&iacute;ka, named S&uacute;ryaprabha, who in
beauty surpasses the god of Love; she went secretly and gave herself to
him. And when she had repaired to him to-day of her own accord at
night-fall, Mahallik&aacute;, the daughter of Prahl&aacute;da, chose to
come there too. Our mistress had a jealous quarrel with her, and was in
consequence preparing to slay herself, when, she was seen by her sister
Sukh&aacute;vat&iacute; and saved. And then she went inside, and
flinging herself down on a bed, she remained with that sister, who was
despondent when she had learnt by enquiry what had taken place.&rsquo;
When I had heard this conversation of the two maids, I entered the
apartment, and beheld Kal&aacute;vat&iacute; and
Sukh&aacute;vat&iacute;, who resembled one another exactly.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span></p>
<p>While Prabh&aacute;sa was saying this to S&uacute;ryaprabha in
private, Prahasta also came there, and being questioned, he said as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;When I arrived from this place at the private
apartment of Mahallik&aacute;, she entered despondent with her two
intimate friends. And I entered also invisible by the employment of
magic science, and I saw there twelve friends like her; and they sat
round Mahallik&aacute;, who reclined on a sofa ornamented with splendid
jewels; and then one said to her, &lsquo;My friend, why do you seem to
be suddenly cast down to-day? What is the meaning of this despondency
when your marriage is about to come off?&rsquo; When the daughter of
Prahl&aacute;da heard that, she answered her friend pensively,
&lsquo;What marriage for me? To whom am I betrothed? Who told
you?&rsquo; When she said that, they all exclaimed, &lsquo;Surely your
marriage will take place to-morrow, and you are betrothed, my friend,
to S&uacute;ryaprabha. And your mother, the queen, told us to-day when
you were not present, and ordered us to decorate you for the marriage
ceremony. So you are fortunate, in that you will have
S&uacute;ryaprabha for a husband, through admiration for whose beauty
the ladies of this place cannot sleep at night. But this is a source of
despondency to us&mdash;What a gulf there will now be between you and
us! When you have obtained him for a husband, you will forget
us.&rsquo; When Mahallik&aacute; heard this from their mouth, she said,
&lsquo;Has he been seen by you, and is your heart attached to
him?&rsquo; When they heard that, they said to her&mdash;&lsquo;We saw
him from the top of the palace, and what woman is there that a sight of
him would not captivate?&rsquo; Then she said, &lsquo;Then I will
persuade my father to cause all of you to be given to him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9757src" href="#xd27e9757" name=
"xd27e9757src">17</a> So we shall live together, and not be
separated.&rsquo; When she said this, the maidens were shocked, and
said to her, &lsquo;Kind friend, do not do so. It would not be proper,
and would make us ashamed.&rsquo; When they said this, the daughter of
the king of the Asuras answered them, &lsquo;Why is it not proper? I am
not to be his only wife: all the Daityas and D&aacute;navas will give
him their daughters, and there are other princesses on the earth whom
he has married, and he will also marry many Vidy&aacute;dhara maidens.
What harm can it do to me that you should be married among these? So
far from it, we shall live happily in mutual friendship; but what
intercourse can I hold with those others who will be my enemies? And
why should you have any shame about the matter? I will arrange it
all.&rsquo; While these ladies were thus conversing, with hearts
devoted to you, I came out at my leisure and repaired to your
presence.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha had heard this from the mouth
of Prahasta, he passed that night in happiness, though he remained
sleepless in his bed.</p>
<p>In the morning he went to the court of Prahl&aacute;da, the king of
the Asuras, with Sun&iacute;tha and Maya and his ministers, to visit
him. Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>Prahl&aacute;da said to Sun&iacute;tha after
showing him respect&mdash;&ldquo;I will give to this S&uacute;ryaprabha
my daughter Mahallik&aacute;, for I must shew him some hospitable
entertainment which will be agreeable to you.&rdquo; Sun&iacute;tha
received with joy this speech of Prahl&aacute;da&rsquo;s. Then
Prahl&aacute;da made S&uacute;ryaprabha ascend an altar-platform, in
the middle of which a fire was burning, and which was adorned with
lofty jewelled pillars illuminated by the brightness of the flame, and
there gave him his daughter, with splendour worthy of the imperial
throne of the Asuras. And he gave to his daughter and her bridegroom
heaps of valuable jewels, obtained by his triumph over the gods,
resembling the summit of mount Meru. And then Mahallik&aacute; boldly
said to Prahl&aacute;da&mdash;&ldquo;Father, give me also those twelve
companions whom I love.&rdquo; But he answered
her&mdash;&ldquo;Daughter, they belong to my brother, for they were
taken captive by him, and I have no right to give them away.&rdquo; And
S&uacute;ryaprabha, after the marriage feast was ended, entered at
night the bridal chamber with Mahallik&aacute;.</p>
<p>And the next morning, when Prahl&aacute;da had gone to the hall of
assembly with his followers, Am&iacute;la, the king of the
D&aacute;navas, said to Prahl&aacute;da and the
others&mdash;&ldquo;To-day you must all come to my house, for I intend
to entertain there this S&uacute;ryaprabha, and I will give him my
daughter Kal&aacute;vat&iacute;, if you approve.&rdquo; This speech of
his they all approved, saying, &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; Then they all
went in a moment to the second under-world, where he dwelt, with
S&uacute;ryaprabha, Maya and others. There Am&iacute;la gave by the
usual ceremony to S&uacute;ryaprabha his daughter, who had previously
given herself. S&uacute;ryaprabha went through the marriage ceremony in
the house of Prahl&aacute;da, and surrounded by the Asuras who had
feasted, spent the day in tasting the enjoyments which they provided
for him.</p>
<p>On the next day, Dur&aacute;roha, a prince of the Asuras, invited
and conducted them all to his own under-world, the fifth. There, by way
of hospitality, he gave to S&uacute;ryaprabha his own daughter
Kumud&aacute;vat&iacute;, as the others had done, in the prescribed
manner. There S&uacute;ryaprabha spent the day in enjoyment with all
these united. And at night he entered the apartment of
Kumud&aacute;vat&iacute;. There he spent that night in the society of
that lovely and loving woman, the beauty of the three worlds.</p>
<p>And the next morning, Tantukachchha invited and conducted him,
surrounded with his companions, headed by Prahl&aacute;da, to his
palace in the seventh under-world. There that king of the Asuras gave
him his daughter Manovat&iacute;, adorned with splendid jewels, bright
as molten gold. There S&uacute;ryaprabha spent a highly agreeable day,
and passed the night in the society of Manovat&iacute;.</p>
<p>And the next day, Sum&aacute;ya, a prince of the Asuras, after
presenting an invitation, conducted him with all his friends to his
under-world, the sixth; there he too gave him his daughter by name
Subhadr&aacute;, with body black as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>stalk of
<i>durb&aacute;</i> grass, like a female incarnation of the god of
Love; and S&uacute;ryaprabha spent that day with that black maiden,
whose face was like a full moon.</p>
<p>And the next day, king Bali, followed by the Asuras, in the same way
led that S&uacute;ryaprabha to his own under-world, the third. There he
gave him his own daughter named Sundar&iacute;, with complexion lovely
as a young shoot, and resembling a cluster of
<i>m&aacute;dhav&iacute;</i> flowers. S&uacute;ryaprabha then spent
that day with that pearl of women in heavenly enjoyment and
splendour.</p>
<p>The next day, Maya also in the same way re-conducted the prince, who
was in the fourth under-world, to his own palace, which possessed
curiously adorned jewelled terraces, was constructed by his own magic
power, and on account of its refulgent splendour seemed to be new every
moment. There he gave him his own daughter, named Sum&aacute;y&aacute;,
whose beauty was the wonder of the world, who seemed to be his own
power incarnate, and he did not think that she ought to be withheld
from him on account of his being a mere mortal. The fortunate
S&uacute;ryaprabha remained there with her. Then the prince divided his
body by his magic science, and lived at the same time with all those
Asura ladies, but with his real body he lived principally with his best
beloved Mahallik&aacute;, the daughter of the Asura
Prahl&aacute;da.</p>
<p>And one night, when he was happy in her presence, he asked the noble
Mahallik&aacute; in the course of conversation&mdash;&ldquo;My dear,
those two female friends, who came with you, where are they? I never
see them. Who are they, and where have they gone?&rdquo; Then
Mahallik&aacute; said&mdash;&ldquo;You have done well to remind me. My
female friends are not two only, but twelve in number, and my
father&rsquo;s brother carried them off from Indra&rsquo;s heaven. The
first is named Am&#7771;itaprabh&aacute;, the second
Ke&#347;in&iacute;, these are the auspiciously marked daughters of the
hermit Parvata. And the third is K&aacute;lind&iacute;, and the fourth
Bhadrak&aacute;, and the fifth is the noble Kamal&aacute; with
beautiful eyes. These three are the daughters of the great hermit
Devala. The sixth is named Saud&aacute;min&iacute; and the seventh
Ujjval&aacute;, these are both of them daughters of the Gandharva
H&aacute;h&aacute;. The eighth is by name P&iacute;var&aacute;, the
daughter of the Gandharva H&uacute;h&uacute;. And the ninth is by name
Anjanik&aacute;, the daughter of the mighty K&aacute;la. And the tenth
is Ke&#347;ar&aacute;val&iacute;, sprung from the Ga&#7751;a Pingala.
And the eleventh is M&aacute;lin&iacute; by name, the daughter of
Kambala, and the twelfth is Mand&aacute;ram&aacute;l&aacute; the
daughter of a Vasu. They are all heavenly nymphs, born from Apsarases,
and, when I was married, they were taken to the first under-world, and
I must bestow them on you, in order that I may be always with them. And
this I promised them, for I love them. I spoke too to my father, but he
refused to give them, out of regard for his brother.&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this, he said to her with a downcast
expression&mdash;&ldquo;My beloved, you are very magnanimous,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>but how can I do this?&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha said this to her, Mahallik&aacute; said in
anger&mdash;&ldquo;In my presence you marry others, but my friends you
do not desire, separated from whom I shall not be happy even for one
moment.&rdquo; When she said this to him, S&uacute;ryaprabha was
pleased and consented to do it. Then that daughter of Prahl&aacute;da
immediately took him to the first under-world and gave him those twelve
maidens. Then S&uacute;ryaprabha married those heavenly nymphs in
order, commencing with Am&#7771;itaprabh&aacute;. And after asking
Mahallik&aacute;&rsquo;s leave, he had them taken by Prabh&aacute;sa to
the fourth under-world and concealed there. And S&uacute;ryaprabha
himself went there secretly with Mahallik&aacute;, but he went to the
hall of Prahl&aacute;da, as before, to take his meals.</p>
<p>There the king of the Asuras said to Sun&iacute;tha and
Maya&mdash;&ldquo;Go all of you to visit the two goddesses Diti and
Danu.&rdquo; They said &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and immediately Maya,
Sun&iacute;tha and S&uacute;ryaprabha left the lower world, accompanied
by the Asuras in order of precedence, and ascended the chariot
Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana, which came to them on being thought of, and
repaired to the hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa situated on a ridge of mount
Sumeru. There they were announced by hermits who shewed them all
courtesy, and after entering they beheld in due order Diti and Danu
together, and bowed their heads at their feet. And those two mothers of
the Asuras cast a favourable look upon them and their followers, and
after shedding tears and kissing them joyfully upon their
heads,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9796src" href="#xd27e9796" name=
"xd27e9796src">18</a> and bestowing their blessing upon them, said to
Maya: &ldquo;Our eyes are to-day blessed, having seen this thy son
Sun&iacute;tha restored to life, and we consider thee one whose merits
have procured him good fortune. And beholding with heart-felt
satisfaction this prosperous Sumund&iacute;ka, born again in the
character of S&uacute;ryaprabha, possessed of heavenly beauty and of
extraordinary virtue, destined to be successful and glorious, abounding
in unmistakeable marks of future greatness, we openly adore him here
with our bodies. Therefore rise up quickly, darlings, and visit
Praj&aacute;pati here, our husband; from beholding him you shall obtain
success in your objects, and his advice will be helpful to you in your
affairs.&rdquo; When Maya and the others received this order from the
goddesses, they went as they were commanded, and beheld the hermit
Ka&#347;yapa in a heavenly hermitage. He was like pure molten gold in
appearance, full of brightness, the refuge of the gods, wearing matted
locks yellow as flame, irresistible as fire. And approaching, they fell
at his feet with their followers, in order; then the hermit gave them
the customary blessing, and after making them sit down, out of delight
at their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>arrival said to them&mdash;&ldquo;I am
exceedingly glad that I have beheld all you my sons; thou art to be
praised, Maya, who, without diverging from the good path, art a
treasure-house of all sciences; and thou art fortunate, Sun&iacute;tha,
who hast recovered thy life though lost, and thou, O
S&uacute;ryaprabha, art fortunate, who art destined to be the king of
the sky-goers. So you must all continue now in the path of
righteousness, and hearken to my word, by means of which you will
obtain the highest fortune, and taste perpetual joys, and by which you
will not again be conquered by your enemies; for it was those Asuras,
that transgressed law, that became a prey for the discus of the
vanquisher of Mura. And those Asuras, Sun&iacute;tha, that were slain
by the gods, are incarnate again as human heroes. He who was thy
younger brother <span class="corr" id="xd27e9816" title=
"Source: Sumundika">Sumund&iacute;ka</span>, has been born indeed now
as S&uacute;ryaprabha. And the other Asuras, who were your companions,
have been born as his friends; for instance, the great Asura, named
&#346;ambara, has been born as his minister Prahasta. And the Asura,
named Tri&#347;iras, has been born as his minister named
Siddh&aacute;rtha. And the D&aacute;nava, named V&aacute;t&aacute;pi,
is now his minister Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya. And the D&aacute;nava,
named Ul&uacute;ka, is now his companion named &#346;ubhankara, and his
present friend V&iacute;tabh&iacute;ti was in a former birth a foe of
the gods, named K&aacute;la. And this Bh&aacute;sa, his minister, is an
incarnation of a Daitya by name Vishaparvan, and his minister
Prabh&aacute;sa is an incarnation of a Daitya named Prabala. He was a
great-hearted Daitya with a frame composed of jewels, who, when asked
by the gods, though they were his enemies, hewed his body to pieces,
and so passed into another state of existence, and from that body of
his all the jewels in the world have originated. The goddess
Durg&aacute; was so pleased at that, that she granted him a boon
accompanied by another body, by virtue of which he has now been born as
Prabh&aacute;sa, mighty, and hard to be overcome by his enemies. And
those D&aacute;navas, who formerly existed under the names of Sunda and
Upasunda, have been born as his ministers Sarvadamana and Bhayankara.
And the two Asuras, who used to be called Vika&#7789;&aacute;ksha and
Hayagr&iacute;va, have been born as his two ministers here,
Sthirabuddhi and Mah&aacute;buddhi. And the others connected with him,
these fathers-in-law, ministers and friends of his, are also
incarnations of Asuras, who have often vanquished Indra and his crew.
So your party has again gradually acquired strength. Be of good
courage; if you do not depart from the right, you shall obtain the
highest prosperity.&rdquo; While the <i>&#7771;ishi</i> Ka&#347;yapa
was saying this, all his wives, the daughters of Daksha, headed by
Aditi, arrived at the time of the mid-day sacrifice. When they had
given their blessing to Maya and the others, who bowed before them, and
had performed their husband&rsquo;s orders for the day, Indra also came
there with the Lokap&aacute;las<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9822src"
href="#xd27e9822" name="xd27e9822src">19</a> to visit the sage. And
Indra, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>after saluting the feet of Ka&#347;yapa and his
wives and after having been saluted by Maya and the others, looking
angrily at S&uacute;ryaprabha, said to Maya,&mdash;&ldquo;This is the
boy, I suppose, that is desirous of becoming emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas; how is he satisfied with so very little, and why
does he not desire the throne of heaven?&rdquo; When Maya heard this,
he said, &ldquo;The throne of heaven was decreed to you by &#346;iva,
and to him was appointed the sovereignty of the
sky-goers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9828src" href="#xd27e9828"
name="xd27e9828src">20</a> When Indra heard this, he said with an angry
laugh&mdash;&ldquo;This would be but a small matter for this comely
shape of a youth who is furnished with such auspicious marks.&rdquo;
Then Maya answered him&mdash;&ldquo;If &#346;ruta&#347;arman deserves
the sovereignty of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, then surely this shape of
his deserves the throne of heaven.&rdquo; When Maya said this, Indra
was angry, and rose and uplifted his thunderbolt, and then the hermit
Ka&#347;yapa made a threatening noise of anger. And Diti and the other
wives became enraged, and their faces were red with anger, and they
loudly cried, &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; Then Indra, afraid of being cursed,
withdrew his weapon, and sat down with bowed head. Then Indra fell at
the feet of that hermit Ka&#347;yapa, the sire of gods and Asuras, who
was surrounded by his wives, and after striving to appease him, made
the following representation with hands folded in supplication:
&ldquo;O reverend one, this S&uacute;ryaprabha is attempting to take
away from &#346;ruta&#347;arman the sovereignty of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, which I bestowed on him. And Maya is exerting
himself in every way to procure it for S&uacute;ryaprabha.&rdquo; When
Praj&aacute;pati heard that, he said, seated with Diti and
Danu,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou lovest &#346;ruta&#347;arman, O Indra, but
&#346;iva loves S&uacute;ryaprabha, and his love cannot be fruitless,
and he long ago ordered Maya to do what he has done. So, what is all
this outcry that thou art making against Maya, what offence has he
committed herein? For he is one who abides in the path of right, wise,
discreet, submissive to his spiritual superior. The fire of my wrath
would have reduced thee to ashes, if thou hadst committed that sin, and
thou hast no power against him; dost thou not recognise his
might?&rdquo; When that hermit with his wives said that, Indra was
abashed with shame and fear, and Aditi said&mdash;&ldquo;What is that
&#346;ruta&#347;arman like? Let him be brought here and shown to
us.&rdquo; When Indra heard this, he sent M&aacute;tali,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9833src" href="#xd27e9833" name=
"xd27e9833src">21</a> and had brought there immediately that
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, the prince of the sky-goers. The wives of
Ka&#347;yapa, when they had seen that &#346;ruta&#347;arman, who
prostrated himself, looked at S&uacute;ryaprabha and said to the hermit
Ka&#347;yapa&mdash;&ldquo;Which of these two is the richer in beauty
and in auspicious marks?&rdquo; Then that chief of hermits said,
&ldquo;&#346;ruta&#347;arman is not even equal to his minister
Prabh&aacute;sa, much less is he equal to that incomparable one. For
this S&uacute;ryaprabha is furnished with various heavenly marks of
such excellence, that, if he were to make the attempt, he would find
even the throne of Indra easy to obtain.&rdquo; When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>they
heard that speech of Ka&#347;yapa&rsquo;s, all there approved it, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;So it is.&rdquo; Then the hermit gave Maya a boon in
the hearing of great Indra&mdash;&ldquo;Because, my son, thou didst
remain undaunted, even when Indra lifted up his weapon to strike,
therefore thou shalt remain unharmed by the plagues of sickness and old
age, which are strong as the thunderbolt. Moreover these two
magnanimous sons of thine, who resemble thee, shall always be
invincible by all their enemies. And this son of mine
Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra, resembling in splendour the autumn moon,
shall come when thou thinkest of him, and assist thee in the night of
calamity. When the hermit had thus spoken, his wives and the
<i>&#7771;ishis</i> and the Lokap&aacute;las in the same way gave boons
to them, to Maya and the rest, in the assembly. Then Aditi said to
Indra&mdash;&ldquo;Desist, Indra, from thy improper conduct, conciliate
Maya, for thou hast seen to-day the fruit of discreet conduct, in that
he has obtained boons from me.&rdquo; When Indra heard that, he seized
Maya by the hand and propitiated him, and <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9841" title=
"Source: Sruta&#347;arman">&#346;ruta&#347;arman</span>, eclipsed by
S&uacute;ryaprabha, was like the moon in the day. Then the king of the
gods immediately prostrated himself before Ka&#347;yapa his spiritual
guide, and returned as he came, accompanied by all the
Lokap&aacute;las; and Maya and the others, by the order of that
excellent hermit, departed from his hermitage to meet success in their
proposed undertaking.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then Maya and Sun&iacute;tha and S&uacute;ryaprabha,
all of them, left that hermitage of Ka&#347;yapa, and reached the
junction of the Chandrabh&aacute;g&aacute; and Air&aacute;vat&iacute;,
where the kings, the friends and connexions of S&uacute;ryaprabha, were
awaiting him. And the kings who were there, when they saw
S&uacute;ryaprabha arrived, rose up weeping in despair, eager to die.
S&uacute;ryaprabha, thinking that their grief arose from not seeing
Chandraprabha, told them the whole occurrence as it happened. Then, as
they still remained despondent, he questioned them, and they
reluctantly related how his wives had been carried off by
&#346;ruta&#347;arman. And they also told him how they were preparing
to commit suicide through grief at that outrage, when they were
forbidden by a heavenly voice. Then S&uacute;ryaprabha in wrath made
this vow&mdash;&ldquo;Even if Brahm&aacute; and all the other gods
protect &#346;ruta&#347;arman, I will certainly overthrow him, a
villain who carries off the wives of others, addicted to treacherous
insolence.&rdquo; And having made this vow, he appointed a moment fixed
by the astrologers on the seventh day, for marching to his overthrow.
Then Maya, perceiving that he was determined, and had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span>made
up his mind to conquer his enemy, again confirmed him with his speech,
and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;If you really have made up your mind, then
I will tell you this; it was I that on that occasion carried off your
wives by magic, and I placed them in the under-world, thinking that
thus you would set about your victorious expedition in an impetuous
manner, for a fire does not of itself burn so fiercely, as it does when
fanned by a breeze. So come, let us go to the under-world; I will shew
you those wives of yours.&rdquo; When they heard that speech of
Maya&rsquo;s, they all rejoiced, and they entered again by the same
opening as before, and went to the fourth under-world, Maya leading the
way. There Maya brought those wives of S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s out
of a dwelling-house, and delivered them over to him. Then
S&uacute;ryaprabha, after receiving those wives, and the others, the
daughters of the Asuras, went by the advice of Maya to visit
Prahl&aacute;da. He, having heard from Maya that S&uacute;ryaprabha had
obtained boons, and being desirous of proving him, took up his weapon,
and said with feigned anger as he bowed before him,&mdash;&ldquo;I have
heard, wicked one, that you have carried off the twelve maidens
captured by my brother, so, I will slay you now; behold me.&rdquo; When
S&uacute;ryaprabha heard that, he said to him, without changing
countenance,&mdash;&ldquo;My body is at your disposal; punish me, for I
have acted improperly.&rdquo; When he said this, Prahl&aacute;da
laughed and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;As far as I have tested you, you
have not a drop of pride in you. Choose a boon, I am pleased with
you.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this, he consented, and chose
as his boon devotion to his superiors and to &#346;iva. Then, all being
satisfied, Prahl&aacute;da gave to S&uacute;ryaprabha a second daughter
of his, named Y&aacute;min&iacute;, and that prince of the Asuras gave
him two of his sons as allies. Then S&uacute;ryaprabha went with all
the rest into the presence of Am&iacute;la. He too was pleased on
hearing that he had obtained the boons, and gave him
Sukh&aacute;vat&iacute; his second daughter, and two of his sons to
help him. Then S&uacute;ryaprabha remained there during those days,
accompanied by his wives, inducing other kings of the Asuras to make
common cause with him. And he heard, in the company of Maya and the
others, that the three wives of Sun&iacute;tha and his own wives, the
daughters of the kings, had all become pregnant, and when asked what
they longed for, they all said, to see that great battle, and the Asura
Maya rejoiced at it, perceiving that the Asuras, who were slain in old
time, had been conceived again in them&mdash;&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;is the cause of their desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So six days passed, but on the seventh S&uacute;ryaprabha and the
others, with their wives and all, set out from the under-world.
Delusive portents, which their rivals displayed to impede them, were
dissipated by Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra, who came when thought of.
Then they anointed Ratnaprabha, the son of Chandraprabha, king of the
earth, and ascended the chariot Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9853src" href="#xd27e9853" name="xd27e9853src">1</a>
and went all of them, by the advice of Maya, to a wood of ascetics
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>on the bank of the eastern Ganges, the dwelling
of Sumeru the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. There Sumeru received
them with all honour, as they had come on a friendly visit, having been
told the whole story by Maya, and remembering the previous command of
&#346;iva. And while Chandraprabha and the others were in that place,
they summoned each of them all their own forces, and also their
relations and friends. First came those princes, the sons of the
fathers-in-law of S&uacute;ryaprabha, who had acquired from Maya the
required sciences, eager for the fray. They were sixteen in number,
headed by Haribha&#7789;a, and each was followed by a force consisting
of a myriad of chariots, and two myriads of footmen. After them came
the Daityas and D&aacute;navas true to their agreement,
brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, friends and other connexions of
S&uacute;ryaprabha.</p>
<p>H&#7771;ishtaroman, and Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya, and
Sinhadansh&#7789;ra and Prakampana, and Tantukachehha and
Dur&aacute;roha, and Sum&aacute;ya, and Vajrapanjara, and
Dh&uacute;maketu, and Pramathana, and the D&aacute;nava
Vika&#7789;&aacute;ksha, and many others came from as low down as the
seventh under-world. One came with seven myriads of chariots, another
with eight, another with six, and another with three, and the least
powerful of all with one myriad. One brought three hundred thousand
footmen, another two hundred thousand, another one hundred thousand,
and the pettiest potentate of all fifty thousand. And each brought a
corresponding number of horses and elephants. And another innumerable
host came belonging to Maya and Sun&iacute;tha. And
S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s own countless army also arrived, and those
of Vasudatta and the other kings, and that of Sumeru.</p>
<p>Then the Asura Maya addressed this question to the hermit
Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra, who came to him when thought of, in the
presence of S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others&mdash;&ldquo;Reverend
sir, we cannot review this army here because it is scattered; so tell
me where we could get a view of the whole army at once extended in long
array.&rdquo; The hermit answered&mdash;&ldquo;Not more than a
<i>yojana</i> from here there is a place called
Kal&aacute;pagr&aacute;ma; go there and behold it drawn up in
line.&rdquo; When the hermit said that, all the princes went with him
and Sumeru to Kal&aacute;pagr&aacute;ma. There they made the armies of
the Asuras and the kings take up their positions, and going to an
elevated spot they reviewed them separately. Then Sumeru
said&mdash;&ldquo;&#346;ruta&#347;arman has the larger force, for he
has under him a hundred and one chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And
every single one of those chiefs is lord of two and thirty kings. Never
mind! I will draw away some and make them join you. So let us go in the
morning to the place named Valm&iacute;ka. For to-morrow is the eighth
lunar day of the black fortnight of Ph&aacute;lguna, which is a high
day. And on that day there is produced there a sign to show the future
emperor, and for that reason the Vidy&aacute;dharas are going there in
a great hurry on that day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href=
"#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Sumeru gave that opinion with regard to the army, they spent
that day in accordance with the law, and went on the morrow to
Valm&iacute;ka in chariots with their army. There they encamped with
shouting forces on the southern plateau of the Him&aacute;layas, and
beheld many Vidy&aacute;dhara kings that had arrived. And those
Vidy&aacute;dharas had lighted fires there in fire-cavities, and were
engaged in sacrificing, and some were occupied with muttering prayers.
Then, where S&uacute;ryaprabha made a fire-cavity, the fire burst forth
of itself, owing to the power of his magic science. When Sumeru saw it,
he was pleased, but envy arose in the breasts of the Vidy&aacute;dharas
at the sight; then one said to him&mdash;&ldquo;For shame, Sumeru! why
do you abandon your rank as a Vidy&aacute;dhara, and follow this
inhabitant of earth named S&uacute;ryaprabha?&rdquo; When Sumeru heard
this, he angrily rebuked him. And when S&uacute;ryaprabha asked his
name, he said&mdash;&ldquo;There is a Vidy&aacute;dhara of the name of
Bh&iacute;ma, and Brahm&aacute; loved his wife at will; from this
connexion he sprang. Since be sprang from Brahm&aacute; in a secret
way, he is called Brahmagupta. Hence he speaks in a style
characteristic of his birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying this, Sumeru also made a fire-cavity. And in it
S&uacute;ryaprabha sacrificed with him to the god of Fire. And in a
moment there suddenly rose from the hole in the ground an enormous and
terrible serpent. In his arrogance, that chief of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Brahmagupta, by whom Sumeru was blamed, ran
to seize it. That serpent thereupon sent forth a hissing wind from its
mouth, which carried Brahmagupta a hundred feet, and flung him down
with such violence that he fell like a withered leaf. Then a chief of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Tejah&#803;prabha, ran to seize it; he
was flung away by it in the same manner. Then a lord of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Dush&#7789;adamana, approached it; he was
hurled back like the others by that blast from its mouth. Then a prince
of the sky-goers, named Vir&uacute;pa&#347;akti, approached it; he too
was flung away as easily as a blade of grass by that breath. Then two
kings, named Ang&aacute;raka and Vij&#7771;imbhaka, ran towards it
together; and it flung them to a distance with its breath. Thus all the
princes of the Vidy&aacute;dharas were flung away one after another,
and rose up with difficulty, with their limbs bruised with stones. Then
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, in his pride, went forward to seize the serpent;
but it hurled him back with the blast of its breath like the others. He
fell at a short distance, and rose up again, and ran again towards it;
when it carried him a greater distance with its breath, and flung him
to earth. Then &#346;ruta&#347;arman rose up abashed, with bruised
limbs, and Sumeru sent S&uacute;ryaprabha to lay hold of the serpent.
And then the Vidy&aacute;dharas ridiculed him, saying, &ldquo;Look! he
too is trying to catch the snake! O! these men, thoughtless as monkeys,
imitate whatever they see another doing.&rdquo; Even while they were
mocking him, S&uacute;ryaprabha went and seized the serpent,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>whose mouth was quiet, and dragged it out of the
hole. But at that moment the serpent became a priceless quiver, and a
rain of flowers fell from the sky on his head. And a heavenly voice
sounded aloud&mdash;&ldquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha, thine is this
imperishable quiver equal to a magic power, so take it.&rdquo; Then the
Vidy&aacute;dharas were cast down, S&uacute;ryaprabha seized the
quiver, and Maya and Sun&iacute;tha and Sumeru were delighted.</p>
<p>Then &#346;ruta&#347;arman departed, accompanied by the host of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and his ambassador came to S&uacute;ryaprabha and
said; &ldquo;The august lord &#346;ruta&#347;arman thus
commands&mdash;&lsquo;Give me that quiver, if you value your
life.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Then S&uacute;ryaprabha said;
&ldquo;Ambassador, go and tell him this&mdash;&lsquo;Your own body
shall become a quiver, bristling all over with my
arrows.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the ambassador heard this speech, he
turned and went away, and all laughed at that furious message of
&#346;ruta&#347;arman&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9877src" href=
"#xd27e9877" name="xd27e9877src">2</a>, and Sumeru, joyfully embracing
S&uacute;ryaprabha, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;I am delighted that that
speech of &#346;iva&rsquo;s has without doubt been fulfilled, for now
that you have acquired this excellent quiver, you have practically
acquired sovereign empire; so come and obtain now a splendid bow with
calm intrepidity.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>When they heard Sumeru say this, and he himself led the way, they
all, S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, went to the mountain
Hemak&uacute;&#7789;a. And on the north side of it they reached a
beautiful lake named M&aacute;nasa, which seemed to have been the first
assay of the Creator&rsquo;s skill when making the sea, which eclipsed
with its full-blown golden lotuses shaken by the wind, the faces of the
heavenly nymphs sporting in the water. And while they were
contemplating the beauty of the lake, &#346;ruta&#347;arman and all the
others came there. And then S&uacute;ryaprabha made a sacrifice with
lotuses and <i>ghee</i>, and immediately a terrible cloud rose up from
that lake. That cloud filled the heaven, and poured down a great rain,
and among the rain-drops fell from the cloud a black serpent. By the
order of Sumeru, S&uacute;ryaprabha rose up, and seized that serpent
with a firm grasp, though it resisted, thereupon it became a bow. When
it became a bow, a second snake fell from the cloud, through fear of
the fiery poison of which all the sky-goers fled. That serpent too,
when seized by S&uacute;ryaprabha, like the first, became a bowstring,
and the cloud quickly disappeared. And after a rain of flowers, a voice
was heard from heaven,&mdash;&ldquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha, you have won
this bow Amitabala and this string which cannot be cut, so take these
priceless treasures.&rdquo; And S&uacute;ryaprabha took that excellent
bow with the string. &#346;ruta&#347;arman, for his part, went
despondent to his wood of ascetics, and S&uacute;ryaprabha, and Maya
and the others were delighted.</p>
<p>Then they asked Sumeru about the origin of the bow, and he
said&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>&ldquo;Here there is a great and marvellous wood
of bamboo canes; whatever bamboos are cut from it and thrown into this
lake, become great and wonderful bows; and these bows have been
acquired by several of the gods before yourself, and by Asuras and
Gandharvas, and distinguished Vidy&aacute;dharas. They have various
names, but the bows appropriated to emperors are all called Amitabala,
and were in old time deposited in the lake by the gods. And they are
obtained, through the favour of &#346;iva, with these exertions, by
certain men of virtuous conduct destined to be emperors. Hence it comes
that S&uacute;ryaprabha has to-day procured this great bow, and these
companions of his shall procure bows suited to them. For they, being
heroes who have acquired the sciences, are appropriate recipients for
them, for they are still procured by worthy men, as is
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the companions of S&uacute;ryaprabha, Prabh&aacute;sa and the
others, heard this speech of Sumeru&rsquo;s, they went to the
bamboo-grove, and after defeating the king Chandradatta, who guarded
it, they brought the bamboos, and threw them into the lake. And these
heroic men, by fasting on the bank of the lake, and muttering prayers,
and sacrificing, obtained bows in seven days. When they returned and
told their adventure, S&uacute;ryaprabha returned with them and Maya
and the others to that wood of ascetics, in which Sumeru dwelt. Then
Sumeru said to him: &ldquo;It is strange that your friends have
conquered Chandradatta, the king of the bamboo-wood, though he is
invincible. He possesses a science called the bewildering science, for
that reason he is hard to conquer. Surely he must have been keeping it
to use against a more important enemy. For this reason he did not
employ it against these companions of yours on the present occasion,
for it only can succeed once in his hands, not repeatedly. For he
employed it once against his spiritual preceptor to try its force,
thereupon he laid upon him this curse. So this matter should be thought
upon, for the might of sciences is hard to overcome, and for that
reason you should consult the revered Maya. What can I say in his
presence? Of what avail is a candle in the face of the sun?&rdquo; When
Sumeru had said this to S&uacute;ryaprabha, Maya said; &ldquo;Sumeru
has told you the truth in few words, listen to this which I now
say&mdash;From undeveloped matter there spring in this world various
powers, and subordinate powers. Among them the sound expressed by
Anusv&aacute;ra arises from the power of breathing, and becomes a spell
of force in magic sciences, when accompanied with the doctrine of the
highest truth. And of those sciences which deal with spells, and which
are acquired by supernatural knowledge, or austerity, or the holy
command of holy men, the power is hard to resist. So, my son, you have
obtained all the sciences, except two, in which you are deficient,
namely, the science of bewildering, and that of counteracting. But
Y&aacute;jnavalkya knows them, therefore go and ask him to bestow them
on you.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When
thus advised by Maya, S&uacute;ryaprabha went into the presence of that
<i>&#7771;ishi</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440"
name="pb440">440</a>]</span></p>
<p>That hermit made him dwell for seven days in the serpent-lake, and
ordered him to perform austerities for three days in the midst of the
fire. And he gave him the bewildering power when he had endured for
seven days the bite of the snakes, and the counteracting power when he
had resisted for three days the force of the fire.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9916src" href="#xd27e9916" name="xd27e9916src">3</a> And when
he had obtained these sciences, that hermit ordered him again to enter
the fire-cavity, and he consented and did it. And immediately there was
bestowed on S&uacute;ryaprabha a chariot in the form of a white lotus,
that moved at the will of the possessor, and travelled through the air,
which was furnished with a hundred and eight wings, and the same number
of dwellings, and constructed of precious jewels of various kinds. And
a voice from heaven addressed that resolute one,&mdash;&ldquo;You have
obtained this chariot suitable for an emperor, and you must place your
wives in all these dwellings, in order that they may be safe from your
enemies.&rdquo; Then he, bending low, addressed this petition to his
preceptor Y&aacute;jnavalkya&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me what fee I am to
pay.&rdquo; The hermit answered him&mdash;&ldquo;Remember me at the
time when you are anointed emperor, this in itself will be sufficient
fee; in the meanwhile go to your army.&rdquo; Then he bowed before that
hermit, and ascended that chariot, and went to his army, that was
encamped in the place where Sumeru dwelt. There he told his story, and
Maya and the others, with Sun&iacute;tha and Sumeru, congratulated him,
now that he had obtained a magic chariot.</p>
<p>Then Sun&iacute;tha called to mind that Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra,
and he came and said to Maya and the others, with the kings;
&ldquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha has obtained a chariot and all the magic
sciences; so why do you even now remain indifferent about conquering
your enemies?&rdquo; When Maya heard that, he said, &ldquo;Reverend
sir, you have spoken rightly, but first let an ambassador be sent, and
let policy be employed.&rdquo; When Maya said this, the hermit&rsquo;s
son said&mdash;&ldquo;So be it! What harm can this do? Let this
Prahasta be sent. He is discerning, eloquent, and understands the
nature of business and occasions, and he is stern and enduring, he
possesses all the qualities of an ambassador.&rdquo; All approved this
speech of his, and after giving Prahasta instructions, they sent him
off as ambassador to &#346;ruta&#347;arman.</p>
<p>When he had gone, S&uacute;ryaprabha said to all his
followers,&mdash;&ldquo;Hear the strange wonderful vision that I have
had&mdash;I remember, I saw toward the end of last night, that we were
all carried away by a great stream of water, and while we were swept
away, we kept dancing, we did not sink at all. Then that stream was
turned back by a contrary breeze. Then a certain man of fiery
brightness drew us out, and threw us into the fire, and we were not
burned by the fire. Then a cloud rained a stream of blood, and that
blood filled the whole sky, then my sleep came to an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>end
with the night.&rdquo; When he said this, Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra
said to him, &ldquo;This dream indicates success preceded by a
struggle. The stream of water is battle, it is due to valour that you
did not sink but danced, and were carried along by the water; the wind,
that turned back the water for you, is some saviour to whom men resort
for protection; and the man of fiery brightness, who drew you out of
it, is &#346;iva in bodily form. And that he threw you into the fire,
means that you are cast into a great war; and that the clouds arose,
that means the returning again of fear; and the rain of a stream of
blood, that means the destroying of fear, and the filling of all the
quarters with blood, that means great success for you. Now dreams are
of many kinds,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9931src" href="#xd27e9931"
name="xd27e9931src">4</a> the rich-sensed, the true-sensed, and the
senseless. A dream which quickly reveals its meaning, is called
rich-sensed, a dream in which a propitious god gives a command, is
called true-sensed, and one which is brought about by deep meditation
and anxiety, they call senseless. For a man under the influence of
sleep, with mind bewildered by the quality of passion and withdrawn
from outward objects, sees a dream on account of various causes. And it
depends upon the time, when it is seen, whether it is fulfilled soon or
late, but this kind of dream which is seen at the end of the night is
quickly fulfilled.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9937src" href=
"#xd27e9937" name="xd27e9937src">5</a><span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When S&uacute;ryaprabha and his
companions heard this from the hermit&rsquo;s son, they were much
pleased, and rising up they performed the duties of the day.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Prahasta returned from the court of
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, and, when asked by Maya and the others, he
described his adventures. &ldquo;I went rapidly hence to the city named
Trik&uacute;&#7789;apat&aacute;k&aacute;, situated on the mountain
Trik&uacute;&#7789;a, built of gold. And being introduced by the
door-keeper, I entered, and beheld &#346;ruta&#347;arman surrounded by
various Vidy&aacute;dhara kings, by his father
Trik&uacute;&#7789;asena, and also by Vikrama&#347;akti and
<span class="corr" id="xd27e9960" title=
"Source: Durandhara">Dhurandhara</span> and other heroes,
D&aacute;modara among them. And sitting down, I said to
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, &lsquo;I am sent to visit you by the august
S&uacute;ryaprabha: and he commissioned me to give you this command. By
the favour of &#346;iva I have obtained precious sciences, and wives
and allies. So come and join my army, together with those chiefs of the
sky-goers; I am the slayer of those that oppose, but the saviour of
those that bend. And as for your carrying off from her relations the
maiden K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i, the daughter of
Sun&iacute;tha, who ought not to be approached, set her at liberty, for
that is a deed of shame.&rsquo; When I said this they all exclaimed in
wrath,&mdash;&lsquo;Who is he that sends us this haughty command? Let
him give commands to mortals, but who is he compared with
Vidy&aacute;dharas? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>Since he assumes such airs, though he is a
miserable mortal, he should be destroyed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard that, I said, &lsquo;What, what? Who is he?
Listen, he has been created by &#346;iva as your future emperor. If he
is a mortal, then mortals have attained divinity, and the
Vidy&aacute;dharas have seen the valour of that mortal; moreover, if he
comes here, we shall soon see which party will be destroyed.&rsquo;
When I said this in wrath, that assembly was disturbed. And
&#346;ruta&#347;arman and Dhurandhara rushed forward to slay me. And I
said to them&mdash;&lsquo;Come now, let me see your valour!&rsquo; Then
D&aacute;modara rose up, and restrained them, exclaiming &lsquo;Peace!
an ambassador and a Br&aacute;hman must not be slain.&rsquo; Then
Vikrama&#347;akti said to me&mdash;&lsquo;Depart, ambassador, for we,
like your master, are all created by &#346;iva. So let him come, and we
will see whether we are able to entertain him or not.&rsquo; When he
said this in a haughty manner, I laughed and said, &lsquo;The swans
utter their cries in the lotus-bower and enjoy themselves much, until
they see the cloud that comes darkening the heaven.&rsquo; After saying
this I rose up in a contemptuous manner, left the court, and came
here.&rdquo; When Maya and others heard this from Prahasta, they were
pleased. And they all, S&uacute;ryaprabha and the rest, determined on
preparing for battle, and made Prabh&aacute;sa, the impetuous in war,
their general. And receiving the command from
Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra, they all prepared that day with strict vows
to consecrate themselves for the combat.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9967src" href="#xd27e9967" name="xd27e9967src">6</a></p>
<p>And at night, S&uacute;ryaprabha, as he was lying sleepless, saw a
wonderful and beautiful maiden enter the chamber, in which he was
occupying a <span class="corr" id="xd27e9975" title=
"Source: soiltary">solitary</span> couch in accordance with his vow.
She came boldly up to him, who pretended to be asleep, with his
ministers sleeping round him, and said to her confidante, who was with
her; &ldquo;If he possesses such glorious beauty, when he is asleep,
and all the graceful motion of his body is still, what must it be, my
friend, when he is awake? So let be! we must not wake him up. I have
gratified the curiosity of my eyes. Why should I fix my heart too
fondly on him? For he will have a battle with <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e9978" title=
"Source: Sruta&#347;arman">&#346;ruta&#347;arman</span>, and who can
say what will befall either party in it? For the feast of battle is for
consuming the lives of heroes. And should he not be fortunate, we shall
have to take some other resolve.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9981src"
href="#xd27e9981" name="xd27e9981src">7</a> And how could one like me
captivate the soul of a man who, when roaming in the air, beheld
K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i?&rdquo; When she said
this, her confidante answered, &ldquo;Why do you say this? Why, fair
one, is it your duty not to allow your heart to attach itself to him?
Why should not he, the sight of whom captivated the heart of
K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i, captivate the heart of
any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>other lady, were she even Arundhat&iacute; in
bodily presence? And do you not know that he will prosper in fight by
the force of science? And when he is emperor, you, and
K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i, and Suprabh&aacute; of
the same family, are to be his wives, so say the holy sages, and in
these very days he has married Suprabh&aacute;. So, how can he be
unsuccessful in fight? For the predictions of the sages are never
falsified. And will you not captivate the heart of the man, whose heart
was captivated by Suprabh&aacute;? For you, blameless one, exceed her
in beauty. And if you hesitate through regard for your relations, that
is not right, for good women have no relations but their
husband.&rdquo; That excellent maiden, when she heard this speech of
her confidante&rsquo;s, said&mdash;&ldquo;You have spoken truth, my
friend, I need no other relations. And I know my husband will conquer
in fight by his science. He has obtained jewels and sciences, but my
mind is grieved because up to the present time he has not obtained the
virtuous herbs. Now they are all in a cave of the mountain
Chandrap&aacute;da. But they are to be obtained by an emperor
possessing virtue. So, if he were to go there and procure those mighty
drugs, it would be well, for his great struggle is nigh at hand, even
to-morrow.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard this, he flung off all
his feigned sleep, and rising up, said respectfully to that
maiden&mdash;&ldquo;Lovely-eyed one, you have shewn great favour to me,
so I will go there, tell me who you are.&rdquo; When the maiden heard
that, she was abashed with shame, and silent, thinking that he had
heard all, but her friend said&mdash;&ldquo;This is a maiden named
Vil&aacute;sin&iacute;, the daughter of Sumeru, the prince of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, who was desirous of beholding you.&rdquo; When her
friend said this, Vil&aacute;sin&iacute; said to her, &ldquo;Come, let
us go now,&rdquo; and went out of the room.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha woke up his ministers, Prabh&aacute;sa and
the rest, and told them of that method of procuring the drugs, which
the lady spoke of. And he sent Prabh&aacute;sa, a fit person to
accomplish that, to tell it to Sun&iacute;tha and Sumeru and Maya. And
when they came and approved of it, S&uacute;ryaprabha, accompanied by
his ministers, went with them in the night to the mountain
Chandrap&aacute;da. And as they were gradually advancing, the Yakshas,
Guhyakas, and Kumbh&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;as, being alarmed, rose up to
bar their way, armed with numerous weapons. Some of them
S&uacute;ryaprabha and his friends bewildered with weapons, some they
paralysed by science, and at last they reached that mountain
Chandrap&aacute;da. When they reached the mouth of the cavern in that
mountain, the Ga&#7751;as of &#346;iva prevented them from entering,
assuming strange deformed countenances. Then Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra
said to S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, &ldquo;We must not fight
with these, for the revered god &#346;iva might be angry. Let us praise
that giver of boons by his eight thousand names, and that will make the
Ga&#7751;as<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9991src" href="#xd27e9991" name=
"xd27e9991src">8</a> favourably disposed to us.&rdquo; Then they all
agreed, and praised &#346;iva; and the Ga&#7751;as, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>pleased at hearing their master praised, said to
them; &ldquo;We abandon this cave to you, take its potent simples. But
S&uacute;ryaprabha must not enter it himself; let Prabh&aacute;sa enter
it, for it will be easy for him to enter.&rdquo; They all said
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and acceded to the advice of the Ga&#7751;as.
Then that cave, as soon as Prabh&aacute;sa entered it, though before
enveloped in darkness, became irradiated with light. And four very
terrible R&aacute;kshasas, who were servants there, rose up, and
bending before him, said to him &ldquo;Enter.&rdquo; Then
Prabh&aacute;sa entered, and collected those seven divine herbs, and
coming out, gave them all to S&uacute;ryaprabha. And that moment a
voice was heard from heaven, saying, &ldquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha, of
great power are these seven drugs which you have obtained
to-day.&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others heard that, they
were delighted, and quickly returned to the dwelling of Sumeru to greet
their army. Then Sun&iacute;tha asked that Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra;
&ldquo;Hermit, why was Prabh&aacute;sa allowed by the Ga&#7751;as to
enter the cave, and not S&uacute;ryaprabha, and why was he also
welcomed by the servants?&rdquo; When the hermit heard that, he said in
the hearing of all, &ldquo;Listen, I will explain
this&mdash;Prabh&aacute;sa is a great benefactor to S&uacute;ryaprabha,
being a second self to him, there is no difference between them.
Moreover, no one is equal in might and courage to Prabh&aacute;sa, and
this cave belongs to him on account of his good deeds in a former life,
and listen, I will tell you what sort of a person he was in a former
existence.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of the generous D&aacute;nava Namuchi.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old times there was an excellent D&aacute;nava
named Namuchi, who was devoted to charity and very brave, and did not
refuse to give anything to anybody that asked, even if he were his
enemy. He practised asceticism as a drinker of smoke for ten thousand
years, and obtained as a favour from Brahm&aacute;, that he should be
proof against iron, stone, and wood. Then he frequently conquered Indra
and made him flee, so the <i>&#7771;ishi</i> Ka&#347;yapa entreated
him, and made him make peace with the gods. Then the gods and Asuras,
as their enmity was at an end, deliberated together, and went to the
ocean of milk, and churned it with the mountain Mandara. And as
Vish&#7751;u and the other gods received Lakshm&iacute; and other
things as their shares, so Namuchi gained the horse
Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas; and the other gods and Asuras received
other various shares, appointed by Brahm&aacute;, of the things that
rose from the sea, when churned. And the <i>am&#7771;ita</i> at last
came up at the end of the churning, and the gods stole it, so a quarrel
again took place between them and the Asuras. Then, as fast as the gods
killed an Asura in their light with them, the horse
Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas immediately restored him to life by smelling
him. The consequence was that the gods found it impossible to conquer
the Daityas and D&aacute;navas. Then V&#7771;ihaspati said in secret to
Indra, who was in despair: &ldquo;There is only one expedient left,
adopt it without delay; go to Namuchi yourself, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span>and
ask him for that excellent horse, for he will certainly give it to you,
though you are his enemy, sooner than mar the glory of open-handedness,
which he has been accumulating since his birth.&rdquo; When the
preceptor of the gods said that to him, great Indra went with the gods
and craved as a boon that horse <span class="corr" id="xd27e10011"
title=
"Source: Uchchaih&#803;&#347;ravas">Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas</span>
from Namuchi. Then the great-hearted Namuchi reflected, &ldquo;I never
turn back a suppliant, so I will not turn back Indra; and how can I, as
long as I am Namuchi, refuse to give him the horse? If the glory of
generosity, which I have long been acquiring in the worlds, were to
wither, what would be the use to me of prosperity, or life?&rdquo;
Accordingly he gave the horse to Indra, although &#346;ukra warned him
not to do it. Then Indra, after he had given the horse, lulled him to
security, and as he could not be slain by any other weapon, killed him
with foam of the Ganges, in which he had placed a thunderbolt. Alas!
terrible in the world is the thirst for enjoyment, carried away by
which even gods do not shrink from unbecoming and infamous conduct.
When Danu, the mother of Namuchi, heard this, being afflicted with
grief, she made by virtue of her asceticism a solemn resolve for the
allaying of her sorrow, &ldquo;May that mighty Namuchi be again born in
my womb, and may he again become invincible by the gods in
battle.&rdquo; Then he was again conceived in her womb, and born as an
Asura composed all of jewels, named Prabala on account of his strength.
Then he performed asceticism, and satisfying supplicants even with his
life, became successful, and as prince of the D&aacute;navas conquered
Indra a hundred times. Then the gods took counsel together, and came to
him, and said to him: &ldquo;By all means give us your body for a human
sacrifice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10014src" href=
"#xd27e10014" name="xd27e10014src">9</a> When he heard that, he gave
them his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>body, although they were his enemies; noble men
do not turn their backs on a suppliant, but bestow on him even their
lives. Then that D&aacute;nava Prabala was cut to pieces by the gods,
and he has been again born in the world of men with the body of
Prabh&aacute;sa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Prabh&aacute;sa was first Namuchi, and then he was
Prabala, and then he became Prabh&aacute;sa, therefore on account of
his merit he is hard for his enemies to conquer. And that cave of
herbs, which belonged to that Prabala, is for that reason the property
of Prabh&aacute;sa, and is at his command with its servants. And below
it there is in P&aacute;t&aacute;la<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10046src" href="#xd27e10046" name="xd27e10046src">10</a> the
mansion of Prabala, and in it there are his twelve head-wives
beautifully adorned, and various jewels, and many kinds of weapons, and
a wishing-stone, and a hundred thousand warriors, and also horses. This
all belongs to Prabh&aacute;sa, and was acquired by him in a former
life. Such a hero is Prabh&aacute;sa; in him nothing is
wonderful.&rdquo; When they heard this from the hermit&rsquo;s son,
S&uacute;ryaprabha and his followers, with Maya and Prabh&aacute;sa,
went immediately to that cavern belonging to Prabh&aacute;sa, that led
down to P&aacute;t&aacute;la, for the purpose of securing the jewels.
Prabh&aacute;sa alone went in by that entrance, and secured his former
wives, and the wishing-stone, and the horses, and the Asura warriors,
and coming out again with all his wealth, he gave great satisfaction to
S&uacute;ryaprabha. Then that S&uacute;ryaprabha, having quickly
obtained what he wished, returned to his own camp with Maya and
Sun&iacute;tha and Prabh&aacute;sa, followed by Sumeru and the other
kings and the ministers. There, after the Asuras and kings and others
had gone to their own quarters, he again was consecrated for the fight,
restraining his passions, and spent the rest of the night on a bed of
<i>ku&#347;a</i> grass.</p>

word, which I have translated &ldquo;human sacrifice,&rdquo; is
<i>purushamedha</i>. For the prevalence of human sacrifices among all
nations of antiquity see Grimm&rsquo;s Teutonic Mythology, translated
by Stallybrass, Vol. I, p. 44 and ff; see also Tylor&rsquo;s Primitive
Culture, Vol. II, p. 246, 353, 361, 365. Dr. Rajendral&aacute;la Mitra.
Rai Bahad&uacute;r, in an essay in the Journal of the Asiatic Society
for 1876, entitled &ldquo;Human Sacrifices in India,&rdquo; traces the
history of the practice in India, and incidentally among the principal
nations of antiquity. The following is his own summary of his
conclusions with respect to the practice in India. (1) That, looking to
the history of human civilization, and the rituals of the Hindus, there
is nothing to justify the belief that in ancient times the Hindus were
incapable of sacrificing human beings to their gods. (2) That the
&#346;unah&#803;&#347;epha hymns of the Rig Veda Sanhit&aacute; most
probably refer to a human sacrifice. (3) That the Aitareya
Br&aacute;hma&#7751;a refers to an actual, and not a typical human
sacrifice. (4) That the Purushamedha originally required the actual
sacrifice of men. (5) That the &#346;atapatha Br&aacute;hma&#7751;a
sanctions human sacrifice in some cases, but makes the Purushamedha
emblematic. (6) That the Taittir&iacute;ya Br&aacute;hma&#7751;a
enjoins the sacrifice of a man at the Horse sacrifice. (7) That the
Pur&aacute;&#7751;as recognise human sacrifices to
Cha&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute; but prohibit the Purushamedha rite. (8)
That the Tantras enjoin human sacrifices to
Cha&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute;, and require that, when human victims are
not available, an effigy of a human being should be sacrificed to her.
Of the sacrifices to Cha&#7751;&#7693;ik&aacute; we have enough and to
spare in the Kath&aacute; Sarit S&aacute;gara. Strange to say, it
appears that human sacrifices were offered in Greece on Mount Lykaion
in Arcadia even in the time of Pausanias. Dim traditions with respect
to the custom are still found among the inhabitants of that region,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early the next morning, S&uacute;ryaprabha set out
from the hermitage of Sumeru with his forces to conquer
&#346;ruta&#347;arman. And arriving near the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>mountain of Trik&uacute;&#7789;a his dwelling
place, he encamped, driving away the enemies&rsquo; army with his own
force, which was established there. And while he was encamped there
with Sumeru, Maya, and others, and was in the hall of council, an
ambassador came from the lord of Trik&uacute;&#7789;a. And when he
came, he said to Sumeru the Vidy&aacute;dhara prince; &ldquo;The king,
the father of &#346;ruta&#347;arman, sends you this message. &lsquo;We
have never entertained you, as you were far off; now you have arrived
in our territory with guests, so now we will shew you appropriate
hospitality.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When Sumeru heard this scoffingly
ambiguous message, he said in answer: &ldquo;Bravo! you will not get
another guest such a fit object of hospitality as we are. Hospitality
will not bear its fruit in the next world, its fruit is in this. So
here we are, entertain us.&rdquo; When Sumeru said this, the ambassador
returned to his master as he came.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, established upon an elevated
place, surveyed their armies encamped separately. Then Sun&iacute;tha
said to his father-in-law the Asura Maya: &ldquo;Explain to me the
arrangement of the warriors in our army.&rdquo; Then that all-knowing
prince of the D&aacute;navas said, &ldquo;I will do so, listen;&rdquo;
and pointing them out with his finger, he began to
say&mdash;&ldquo;These kings Sub&aacute;hu, Nirgh&aacute;ta,
Mush&#7789;ika, and Gohara, and Pralamba, and Pram&aacute;tha, and
Kanka&#7789;a, and Pingala, and Vasudatta and others, are considered
half-power warriors.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10061src" href=
"#xd27e10061" name="xd27e10061src">1</a> And Ankurin, and
Suvi&#347;&aacute;la, and Da&#7751;&#7693;in, and
Bh&uacute;sha&#7751;a, and Somila, and Unmattaka, and Deva&#347;arman,
and Pit&#7771;i&#347;arman, and Kum&aacute;raka, and Haridatta and
others are all full-power warriors. And Prakampana, and Darpita, and
Kumbh&iacute;ra, and M&aacute;t&#7771;ip&aacute;lita, and
Mah&aacute;bha&#7789;a, and V&iacute;rasv&aacute;min, and
Sur&aacute;dhara, and Bh&aacute;&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;ra, and
Sinhadatta and Gu&#7751;avarman, with K&iacute;&#7789;aka and
Bh&iacute;ma and Bhayankara, these are all warriors of double power.
And Virochana, and V&iacute;rasena, and Yajnasena, and Khujjara, and
Indravarman, and &#346;evaraka, and Kr&uacute;rakarman, and
Nir&aacute;saka, these princes are of triple power, my son. And
Su&#347;arman, and B&aacute;hu&#347;&aacute;lin, and
Vi&#347;&aacute;kha, and Krodhana, and
Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a,&mdash;these princes are warriors of fourfold
power. And Junjarin, and V&iacute;ra&#347;arman, and
Prav&iacute;ravara, and Supratijna and Mar&aacute;r&aacute;ma, and
Cha&#7751;&#7693;adanta, and J&aacute;lika, and the three,
Sinhabha&#7789;a, Vy&aacute;ghrabha&#7789;a, and &#346;atrubha&#7789;a,
these kings and princes are warriors of fivefold power. But this prince
Ugravarman is a warrior of sixfold power. And the prince Vi&#347;oka,
and Sutantu, and Sugama, and Narendra&#347;arman are considered
warriors of sevenfold power. And this king Sahasr&aacute;yu is a great
warrior. But this &#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka is lord of a host of
great warriors. And Subh&aacute;sa, Harsha, and Vimala, the companions
of S&uacute;ryaprabha, Mah&aacute;buddhi and Achalabuddhi, Priyankara
and &#346;ubhankara <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448"
name="pb448">448</a>]</span>are great warriors, as also Yajnaruchi and
Dharmaruchi. But Vi&#347;varuchi, and Bh&aacute;sa, and
Siddh&aacute;rtha, these three ministers of S&uacute;ryaprabha, are
chiefs of hosts of great warriors. And his ministers Prahasta and
Mah&aacute;rtha are leaders of hosts of transcendent warriors. And
Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya and Sthirabuddhi are leaders of hosts of hosts
of warriors; and the D&aacute;nava Sarvadamana, and Pramathana here,
and Dh&uacute;maketu, and Pravahana, and Vajrapanjara, and
K&aacute;lachakra, and Marudvega are leaders of warriors and
transcendent warriors. Prakampana and Sinhan&aacute;da are leaders of
hosts of leaders of hosts of warriors. And Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya, and
K&aacute;mbalika, and K&aacute;lakampana here, and
Prah&#7771;ishtaroman, these four lords of the Asuras, are kings over
chiefs of hosts of transcendent warriors. And this Prabh&aacute;sa, the
general of the army, who is equal to S&uacute;ryaprabha, and this son
of Sumeru, Kunjarakum&aacute;ra, these two are leaders of hosts of
chiefs of hosts of great warriors. Such heroes are there in our army,
and others besides, girt with their followers. There are more in the
hostile army, but &#346;iva being well disposed towards us, they will
not be able to resist our host.</p>
<p>While the Asura Maya was saying this to Sun&iacute;tha, another
ambassador came from the father of &#346;ruta&#347;arman, and said thus
to him; &ldquo;The king of <span class="corr" id="xd27e10068" title=
"Source: Trik&uacute;ta">Trik&uacute;&#7789;a</span> sends this message
to you; &lsquo;This is a great feast for heroes&mdash;the feast, which
goes by the name of battle. This ground is narrow for it, therefore let
us leave it, and go to a place named Kal&aacute;pagr&aacute;ma, where
there is a wide space.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When Sun&iacute;tha and the
other chiefs with their soldiers heard this, they agreed, and all of
them went with S&uacute;ryaprabha to Kal&aacute;pagr&aacute;ma. And
&#346;ruta&#347;arman and his partizans also, eager for battle, went to
that same place, surrounded with the hosts of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.
When S&uacute;ryaprabha and his chiefs saw elephants in the army of
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, they summoned their contingent of elephants,
which was conveyed in the chariot that flew through the air. Then
D&aacute;modara, that excellent Vidy&aacute;dhara, drew up his army in
the form of a large needle; &#346;ruta&#347;arman himself took up his
position on the flank with his ministers, and D&aacute;modara was in
front, and other great warriors in other places. And Prabh&aacute;sa,
the leader of S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s army, arranged it in the form
of a crescent; he himself was in the centre, and Kunjarakum&aacute;ra
and Prahasta at the two horns; and S&uacute;ryaprabha, and
Sun&iacute;tha and the other chiefs, all remained in the rear. And
Sumeru with Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra stood near him. Thereupon the
war-drums were beaten in both armies.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the heaven was filled with the gods, come to
see the battle, together with Indra, and the Lokap&aacute;las, and the
Apsarases. And &#346;iva, the lord of all, came there with
P&aacute;rvat&iacute;, followed by deities, and the Ga&#7751;as, and
demons, and the mothers.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10073src" href=
"#xd27e10073" name="xd27e10073src">2</a> And holy Brahm&aacute; came
accompanied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name=
"pb449">449</a>]</span>by the Vedas incarnate in bodily form, beginning
with the G&aacute;yatr&iacute;, and the &#346;&aacute;stras and all the
great &#7770;ishis. And the god Vish&#7751;u came, riding on the king
of birds, bearing his weapon the discus, accompanied by goddesses, of
whom the goddesses of Fortune, Glory, and Victory were the chief. And
Ka&#347;yapa came with his wives, and the &Aacute;dityas and the Vasus,
and the chiefs of the Yakshas, R&aacute;kshasas and snakes, and also
the Asuras with Prahl&aacute;da at their head. The sky was obscured
with them, and the battle of those two armies began, terrible with the
clashing of weapons, accompanied with loud shouts. The whole heaven was
darkened by the dense cloud of arrows, through which the flashes, made
by the arrows striking against one another, played like lightning, and
rivers of blood flowed, swollen with the gore of many elephants and
horses wounded with weapons, in which the bodies of heroes moved like
alligators. That battle gave great delight to heroes, jackals, and
goblins, that danced, waded, and shouted in blood.</p>
<p>When the confused <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, in which countless
soldiers fell, had abated, S&uacute;ryaprabha, and the other chiefs,
gradually began to perceive the distinction between their own army and
that of the enemy, and heard in order from Sumeru the names and lineage
of the chiefs fighting in front of the enemies&rsquo; host. Then first
took place a single combat between king Sub&aacute;hu and a chief of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa.
Sub&aacute;hu fought a long time, until A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa,
after riddling him with arrows, cut off his head with a crescent-headed
shaft. When Mush&#7789;ika saw that Sub&aacute;hu was slain, he rushed
forward in wrath; he too fell smitten by A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa
with an arrow in the heart. When Mush&#7789;ika was slain, a king named
Pralamba in wrath rushed on, and attacked A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa
with showers of arrows, but A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa slew his
retainers, and striking the hero Pralamba with an arrow in a mortal
place, laid him low on the seat of his chariot. A king named Mohana,
when he saw Pralamba dead, engaged with A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa and
smote him with arrows. Then A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa cut his bow and
slew his charioteer, and laid him low, slain with a terrific blow. When
the host of &#346;ruta&#347;arman saw that the dexterous
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa had slain those four warriors, expecting
the victory, they shouted for joy. When Harsha, the companion of
S&uacute;ryaprabha, saw that, he was wroth, and with his followers
attacked A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa and his followers; and with shafts
he repelled his shafts, and he slew his followers, and killed his
charioteer, and two or three times cut his bow and his banner, and at
last he cleft asunder his head with his arrows, so that he fell from
his chariot on the earth, pouring forth a stream of blood. When
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa was slain, there was such a panic in the
battle, that in a moment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href=
"#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>only half the two armies remained.
Horses, elephants and footmen fell down there slain, and only the
trunks of slaughtered men remained standing in the van of battle.</p>
<p>Then a chief of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
Vik&#7771;itadansh&#7789;ra, angry at the slaughter of
A&#7789;&#7789;ah&aacute;sa, showered arrows upon Harsha. But Harsha
repelled his arrows, struck down his chariot-horses, and his banner and
his charioteer, and cut off his head with its trembling earrings. But
when Vik&#7771;itadansh&#7789;ra was killed, a Vidy&aacute;dhara king,
named Chakrav&aacute;la, in wrath attacked Harsha; he slew Harsha still
fighting on, though fatigued with combat, after his bow had been
frequently cut asunder, and his other weapons damaged. Angry at that,
king Pram&aacute;tha attacked him, and he too was slain by that
Chakrav&aacute;la in fight. In the same way four other distinguished
kings, who attacked him one by one, were slain one after another by
that Chakrav&aacute;la, namely, Kanka&#7789;a, and Vi&#347;&aacute;la,
and Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a and Ankurin. When king Nirgh&aacute;ta saw
that, he was wroth, and attacked Chakrav&aacute;la, and those two,
Chakrav&aacute;la and Nirgh&aacute;ta, fought for a long time, and at
last they broke one another&rsquo;s chariots to pieces, and so became
infantry soldiers, and the two, rushing furiously together, armed with
sword and discus, cleft with sword-strokes one another&rsquo;s heads,
and fell dead on the earth. Then the two armies were dispirited, seeing
those two warriors dead, but nevertheless a king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named K&aacute;lakampana, stepped forward to the
front of the fight. And a prince, named Prakampana, attacked him, but
he was in a moment struck down by that K&aacute;lakampana. When he was
struck down, five other warriors attacked K&aacute;lakampana, namely
J&aacute;lika, and Cha&#7751;&#7693;adatta, and Gopaka, and Somila, and
Pit&#7771;i&#347;arman; all these let fly arrows at him at the same
time. But K&aacute;lakampana deprived all five of their chariots, and
slew them at the same time, piercing the five with five arrows in the
heart. That made the Vidy&aacute;dharas shout for joy, and the men and
Asuras despond. Then four other warriors rushed upon him at the same
time, Unmattaka and Pra&#347;asta, Vilambaka and Dhurandhara;
K&aacute;lakampana slew them all easily, in the same way he killed six
other warriors that ran towards him, Tejika, and Geyika, and Vegila,
and &#346;&aacute;khila, and Bhadrankara and Da&#7751;&#7693;in, great
warriors with many followers. And again he slew five others that met
him in fight, Bh&iacute;ma, Bh&iacute;sha&#7751;a, Kumbh&iacute;ra,
Vika&#7789;a, and Vilochana. And a king, named Suga&#7751;a, when he
saw the havoc that K&aacute;lakampana had made in the battle, ran to
meet him. K&aacute;lakampana fought with him until both had their
horses and charioteers killed, and were compelled to abandon their
chariots; then K&aacute;lakampana, reduced to fight on foot, laid
Suga&#7751;a, who was also fighting on foot, low on the earth with a
sword-cut. Then the sun, having beheld that surprising struggle of
Vidy&aacute;dharas with men, went grieved to rest.<a class="noteref"

only did the field of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href=
"#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span>battle become red, filled with
streaming blood, but the heaven also became red, when evening set her
foot-prints there. Then the corpses and demons began their evening
dance, and both armies, stopping the battle, went to their camps. In
the army of &#346;ruta&#347;arman were slain that day three heroes, but
thirty-three distinguished heroes were slain in the army of
S&uacute;ryaprabha.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, grieved at the slaughter of his kinsmen and
friends, spent that night apart from his wives. And eager for the
fight, he passed that night in various military discussions with his
ministers, without going to sleep. And his wives, grieved on account of
the slaughter of their relations, met together in one place that night,
having come for the sake of mutual condolence. But even on that
melancholy occasion they indulged in miscellaneous conversation; there
is no occasion on which women are not irrelevant in their talk. In the
course of this conversation, one princess said&mdash;&ldquo;It is
wonderful! How comes it that to-night our husband has gone to sleep
without any of his wives?&rdquo; Hearing that, another
said&mdash;&ldquo;Our husband is to-day grieved on account of the
slaughter of his followers in battle, so how can he take any pleasure
in the society of women?&rdquo; Then another said, &ldquo;If he were to
obtain a new beauty, he would that instant forget his grief.&rdquo;
Then another said&mdash;&ldquo;Do not say so; although he is devoted to
the fair sex, he would not behave in this way on such a sad
occasion<span class="corr" id="xd27e10110" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; While they were thus speaking, one said
with wonder; &ldquo;Tell me why our husband is so devoted to women,
that, though he has carried off many wives, he is perpetually marrying
new princesses and is never satisfied.&rdquo; One of the wives, a
clever woman of the name of Manovat&iacute;, said when she heard
this,&mdash;&ldquo;Hear why kings have many loves. The good qualities
of lovely women are different, varying with their native land, their
beauty, their age, their gestures, and their accomplishments, no one
woman possesses all good qualities. The women of
Kar&#7751;&aacute;&#7789;a, of L&aacute;&#7789;a, of
Saur&aacute;sh&#7789;ra and Madhyade&#347;a, please by the peculiar
behaviour of their various countries. Some fair ones captivate by their
faces like an autumn moon, others by their breasts full and firm like
golden ewers, and others by their limbs, charming from their beauty.
One has limbs yellow as gold, another is dark like a <i>priyangu</i>,
another, being red and white, captivates the eyes as soon as seen. One
is of budding beauty, another of full-developed youth, another is
agreeable on account of her maturity, and distinguished by increasing
coquetry. One looks lovely when smiling, another is charming even in
anger, another charms with gait resembling that of an elephant, another
with swan-like motion. One, when she prattles, irrigates the ears with
nectar; another is naturally beautiful, when she looks at one with
graceful contraction of the eyebrows. One charms by dancing, another
pleases by singing, and another fair one attracts by being able to play
on the lyre and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452"
name="pb452">452</a>]</span>other instruments. One is distinguished for
good temper, another is remarkable for artfulness; another enjoys good
fortune from being able to understand her husband&rsquo;s mind. But, to
sum up, others possess other particular merits; so every lovely woman
has some peculiar good point, but of all the women in the three worlds
none possesses all possible virtues. So kings, having made up their
minds to experience all kinds of fascinations, though they have
captured many wives for themselves, are for ever seizing new
ones.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10118src" href="#xd27e10118" name=
"xd27e10118src">4</a> But the truly noble never, under any
circumstances, desire the wives of others. So this is not our
husband&rsquo;s fault, and we cannot be jealous.&rdquo; When the
head-wives of S&uacute;ryaprabha, beginning with Madanasen&aacute;, had
been addressed in this style by Manovat&iacute;, they made one after
another remarks to the same effect. Then, in their merriment, they laid
aside all the ties of reserve, and began to tell one another all kinds
of secrets. For unfortunately there is nothing which women will not let
out, when they are met together in social intercourse, and their minds
are interested in the course of the conversation. At last that long
conversation of theirs was somehow or other brought to an end, and in
course of time the night passed away, during which S&uacute;ryaprabha
was longing to conquer the host of his enemies, for he was alone,
intently waiting for the time when the darkness should depart.<a class=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XLVIII.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning, S&uacute;ryaprabha and his party,
and &#346;ruta&#347;arman and his supporters, again went to the field
of battle armed, with their forces. And again the gods and Asuras, with
Indra, Brahm&aacute;, Vish&#7751;u, and Rudra, and with the Yakshas,
snakes, and Gandharvas, came to see the fight. D&aacute;modara drew up
the troops of &#346;ruta&#347;arman in the form of a discus, and
Prabh&aacute;sa drew up the troops of S&uacute;ryaprabha in the form of
a thunderbolt. Then the battle of those two armies went on, deafening
the horizon with drums and the shouts of champions, and the sun hid
himself in flights of arrows, as if out of fear that the warriors
smitten with weapons would certainly pierce his disk. Then
Prabh&aacute;sa, by command of S&uacute;ryaprabha, broke the
discus-arrangement of the enemy&rsquo;s host, hard for another to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>break, and entered alone. And D&aacute;modara
himself came and defended that opening in the line, and Prabh&aacute;sa
fought against him unaided. And S&uacute;ryaprabha, seeing that he had
entered alone, sent fifteen great warriors to follow him, Prakampana,
and Dh&uacute;mraketu, and K&aacute;lakampana, and
Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya, and Marudvega, and Prahasta, and Vajrapanjara,
and K&aacute;lachakra, and Pramathana, and Sinhan&aacute;da, and
Kambala, and Vika&#7789;&aacute;ksha, and Pravahana, and
Kunjarakum&aacute;raka, and Prah&#7771;ishtaroman the heroic Asura
prince: all those great warriors rushed forward to the opening in the
line; then D&aacute;modara exhibited his wonderful heroism, in that
alone he fought with those fifteen.</p>
<p>When Indra saw that, he said to the hermit N&aacute;rada, who was at
his side, &ldquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others of his party are
incarnations of Asuras, but &#346;ruta&#347;arman is a portion of me,
and all these Vidy&aacute;dharas are portions of the gods, so observe,
hermit, this is a disguised fight between the gods and Asuras. And
observe, in it Vish&#7751;u is, as ever, the ally of the gods, for
D&aacute;modara, who is a portion of him, is fighting here.<span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>While Indra was saying this, fourteen great warriors came to assist
the general D&aacute;modara,&mdash;Brahmagupta and V&aacute;yubala, and
Yamadansh&#7789;ra, and Surosha&#7751;a, and Rosh&aacute;varoha, and
Atibala, and Tejah&#803;prabha, and Dhurandhara, and Kuveradatta, and
Varu&#7751;a&#347;arman, and K&aacute;mbalika, and the hero
Dush&#7789;adamana, and Dohana and &Aacute;roha&#7751;a. And those
fifteen heroes, joined with D&aacute;modara, fighting in front of the
line, kept off the followers of S&uacute;ryaprabha. Then single combats
took place between them; Prakampana carried on a missile fight with
D&aacute;modara, and Dh&uacute;mraketu fought with Brahmagupta, and
Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya fought with Atibala, the D&aacute;nava
K&aacute;lakampana fought with Tejah&#803;prabha, and the great Asura
Marudvega with V&aacute;yubala, and Vajrapanjara fought with
Yamadansh&#7789;ra, and the heroic Asura K&aacute;lachakra with
Surosha&#7751;a; Pramathana fought with Kuveradatta, and the king of
the Daityas, named Sinhan&aacute;da, with Varu&#7751;a&#347;arman.
Pravahana fought with Dush&#7789;adamana, and the D&aacute;nava
Prah&#7771;ishtaroman fought with Rosh&aacute;varoha; and
Vika&#7789;&aacute;ksha fought with Dhurandhara, <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e10149" title="Source: Kambalika">Kambala</span> fought with
K&aacute;mbalika, and Kunjarakum&aacute;raka with &Aacute;roha&#7751;a,
and Prahasta with Dohana, who was also called Mahotp&aacute;ta.</p>
<p>When these pairs of warriors were thus fighting in the front of the
line, Sun&iacute;tha said to Maya, &ldquo;Alas! observe, our heroic
warriors, though skilled in the use of many weapons, have been
prevented by these antagonists from entering the enemies&rsquo; line;
but Prabh&aacute;sa entered before recklessly alone, so we do not know
what will become of him there.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra heard
this, he said, &ldquo;All the gods, Asuras, and men in the three worlds
are not a match for this Prabh&aacute;sa unaided, much less then are
these Vidy&aacute;dharas. So why do you fear without reason, though you
know this well enough?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454"
href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span></p>
<p>While the hermit&rsquo;s son was saying this, the Vidy&aacute;dhara
K&aacute;lakampana came to meet Prabh&aacute;sa in fight. Then
Prabh&aacute;sa said to him, &ldquo;Ha! Ha! you have rendered me a
great service, so let me now see your valour here.&rdquo; Saying this,
Prabh&aacute;sa let fly at him a succession of arrows, and
K&aacute;lakampana in return showered sharp arrows upon him. Then that
Vidy&aacute;dhara and that man fought together with arrows and
answering arrows, making the worlds astonished. Then Prabh&aacute;sa
with a sharp arrow struck down the banner of K&aacute;lakampana, with a
second he killed his charioteer, with four more his four horses, and
with one more he cut his bow in half, with two more he cut off his
hands, with two more his arms, and with two more his two ears, and with
one sharp-edged arrow he cut off the head of his foe, and thus
displayed wonderful dexterity. Thus Prabh&aacute;sa, as it were,
chastised K&aacute;lakampana, being angry with him because he had slain
so many heroes in his own army. And the men and Asuras, when they saw
that Vidy&aacute;dhara chief slain, raised a shout, and the
Vidy&aacute;dharas immediately proclaimed their despondency.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10160src" href="#xd27e10160" name=
"xd27e10160src">1</a></p>
<p>Then a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named Vidyutprabh&aacute;,
lord of the hill of K&aacute;lanjara, in wrath attacked
Prabh&aacute;sa. When he was fighting with Prabh&aacute;sa,
Prabh&aacute;sa first cut asunder his banner, and then kept cutting his
bows in two, as fast as he took them up. Then the Vidy&aacute;dhara,
being ashamed, by his delusive power flew up invisible into the sky,
and rained swords, clubs, and other weapons upon Prabh&aacute;sa.
Prabh&aacute;sa, for his part, swept away his succession of missiles
with others, and by the illuminating weapon made that Asura manifest,
and then employing the weapon of fire, he burned up Vidyutprabh&aacute;
with its blaze, and bringing him down from the heaven, laid him dead on
the earth.</p>
<p>When &#346;ruta&#347;arman saw this, he said to his warriors,
&ldquo;Observe, this man has slain two chiefs of hosts of great
warriors. Now why do you put up with it? Join together and slay
him.&rdquo; When they heard that, eight warriors in anger surrounded
Prabh&aacute;sa. One was a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named
&Uacute;rdhvaroman, a lord of hosts of warriors, dwelling in the great
mountain named Vanka&#7789;aka. And the second warrior was a chief of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas named Vikro&#347;ana, the king of the rock
Dhara&#7751;&iacute;dhara. And the third was the hero
Indram&aacute;lin, a prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, lord of a host
of distinguished warriors, and his home was the mountain
L&iacute;l&aacute;. And the fourth was an excellent Vidy&aacute;dhara
named king K&aacute;ka&#7751;&#7693;aka, a chief of a host of warriors,
and his dwelling was in the mountain Malaya. And the fifth was
Darpav&aacute;ha by name, lord of the hill Niketa, and the sixth was
Dh&uacute;rtavyayana the lord of the mountain Anjana, and both these
Vidy&aacute;dharas were chiefs of excellent warriors. And the seventh
one, whose chariot was drawn by asses, was named
Var&aacute;hasv&aacute;min, king of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>mount Kumuda, and he
was chief of a host of great warriors. And the eighth warrior was like
him, Medh&aacute;vara king of Dundhubhi. Prabh&aacute;sa repelled the
numerous arrows, which these eight came and discharged, and he pierced
them all at the same time with arrows. And he slew the horse of one,
and of one the charioteer, and he cut in half the banner of one, and he
cleft the bow of another. But Medh&aacute;vara he struck at the same
time with four arrows in the heart, and at once laid him dead on the
earth. And then he fought with the others, and cut off with an <i lang=
"sa-latn">anjalika</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e10174src" href=
"#xd27e10174" name="xd27e10174src">2</a> the head of &Uacute;rdhvaroman
with its curled and plaited hair, and of the other six he killed the
horses and charioteers, and at last laid themselves low, cutting off
their heads with crescent-headed arrows. And then a rain of flowers
fell on his head from heaven, encouraging the kings of the Asuras, and
discouraging the Vidy&aacute;dharas. Then four more great warriors,
armed with bows, sent by &#346;ruta&#347;arman, surrounded
Prabh&aacute;sa; one was named K&aacute;charaka, the lord of the
mountain Kura&#7751;&#7693;a; the second Di&#7751;&#7693;im&aacute;lin,
whose home was the hill of Panchaka, and the third was
Vibh&aacute;vasu, king of the mountain Jayapura, the fourth was named
Dhavala, the ruler of Bh&uacute;mitu&#7751;&#7693;ika. Those excellent
Vidy&aacute;dharas, chiefs of hosts of great warriors, let fly five
hundred arrows at the same time at Prabh&aacute;sa. But Prabh&aacute;sa
easily disposed of all, one by one, each with eight arrows; with one
arrow he cut down the banner, with one cleft the bow, with one he
killed the charioteer, with four the horses, and with one more he cut
off the head of the warrior, and then shouted triumphantly.</p>
<p>Then another four Vidy&aacute;dharas, by the order of
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, assembled in fight against Prabh&aacute;sa. The
first was named Bhadrankara, dark as the blue water-lily, sprung from
Mercury in the house<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10179src" href=
"#xd27e10179" name="xd27e10179src">3</a> of Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu, but
the second was Niyantraka like the fire in brightness, sprung from Mars
in the house of Jambaka, and the third was called K&aacute;lakopa, very
black in hue, with tawny hair, sprung from Saturn in the house of
D&aacute;modara. And the fourth was Vikrama&#347;akti, like gold in
brightness, sprung from the planet Jupiter in the house of the Moon.
The three first were lords of hosts of lords of hosts of transcendent
warriors, but the fourth was a great hero surpassing the rest in
valour. And those haughty chiefs attacked Prabh&aacute;sa with heavenly
weapons. Prabh&aacute;sa repelled their weapons with the weapon of
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a, and easily cut asunder the bow of each
eight times; then he repelled the arrows and clubs which they hurled,
and slaying their horses and charioteers, deprived them all of their
chariots. When &#346;ruta&#347;arman saw that, he quickly sent other
ten lords of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb456" href="#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>chiefs of lord of
hosts of lords of hosts of warriors, two called Dama and Niyama, who
exactly resembled one another in appearance, two sons born to the
A&#347;vins in the house of the lord of Ketum&aacute;l&aacute;, and
Vikrama and Sankrama, and Par&aacute;krama and &Aacute;krama, and
Sammardana and Mardana, and Pramardana and Vimardana, the eight similar
sons of the Vasus born in the house of Makaranda. And when they came,
the previous assailants mounted other chariots. Wonderful to say,
though all those fourteen joined together, and showered arrows on
Prabh&aacute;sa, he alone fought with them fearlessly. Then, by the
order of S&uacute;ryaprabha, Kunjarakum&aacute;ra and Prahasta left the
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and flying up from the front of the line,
weapons in hand, white and black in hue, came to the aid of
Prabh&aacute;sa, like R&aacute;ma and K&#7771;ish&#7751;a over again.
They, though fighting on foot, harassed Dama and Niyama, by cutting
asunder their bows and killing their charioteers. When they, in their
fear, soared up to heaven, Kunjarakum&aacute;ra and Prahasta soared up
also, weapons in hand. When S&uacute;ryaprabha saw that, he quickly
sent them his ministers Mah&aacute;buddhi and Achalabuddhi to act as
charioteers. Then Prahasta and Kunjarakum&aacute;ra discovered, by
employing magic collyrium, those two sons of the Vidy&aacute;dharas,
Dama and Niyama, though they had made themselves invisible by magic
power, and riddled them so with showers of arrows that they fled. And
Prabh&aacute;sa, fighting with the other twelve, cleft all their bows
asunder, though they kept continually taking fresh ones. And Prahasta
came and killed at the same time the charioteers of all, and
Kunjarakum&aacute;ra slew their horses. Then those twelve together,
being deprived of their chariots, and finding themselves smitten by
three heroes, fled out of the battle.</p>
<p>Then &#346;ruta&#347;arman, beside himself with grief, anger and
shame, sent two more Vidy&aacute;dharas, captains of hosts of warriors
and distinguished warriors; one was called Chandragupta born in the
house of the lord of the great mountain Chandrakula, beautiful as a
second moon, and the second was his own minister named Narangama, of
great splendour, born in the house of the lord of the mountain
Dhurandhara. They also, after discharging a shower of arrows, were in a
moment deprived of their chariots by Prabh&aacute;sa and his comrades,
and disappeared.</p>
<p>Then the men and Asuras shouted for joy; but thereupon
&#346;ruta&#347;arman came himself, with four great warriors of mighty
force, named Mahaugha, &Aacute;roha&#7751;a, Utp&aacute;ta and
Vetravat, the sons respectively of <span class="corr" id="xd27e10194"
title="Source: Tvash&#7789;ri">Tvash&#7789;&#7771;i</span>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10197src" href="#xd27e10197" name=
"xd27e10197src">4</a> Bhaga, Aryaman and P&uacute;shan, born in the
houses of the four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457"
name="pb457">457</a>]</span>Vidy&aacute;dhara kings, Chitrapada and
others, that ruled over mount Malaya. And &#346;ruta&#347;arman
himself, blinded with furious anger, was the fifth, and they all fought
against Prabh&aacute;sa and his two companions. Then the host of
arrows, which they shot at one another, seemed like a canopy spread in
the sky by the Fortune of war in the full blaze of the sun. Then those
other Vidy&aacute;dharas, who had been deprived of their chariots, and
had fled from the battle, came back into the fight.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, seeing many of them assembled in fight,
under the leadership of &#346;ruta&#347;arman, sent other great
warriors of his own to support Prabh&aacute;sa and his comrades, his
own friends with Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya at their head, and the princes
of whom &#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka and V&iacute;rasena were the chief.
They flew through the air, and S&uacute;ryaprabha sent the other
warriors also through the air in the chariot Bhut&aacute;s&aacute;na.
When all those archers had gone chariot-borne, the other
Vidy&aacute;dhara kings, who were on the side of &#346;ruta&#347;arman,
also came up. Then a fight took place between those Vidy&aacute;dhara
princes on the one side, and Prabh&aacute;sa and his comrades on the
other, in which there was a great slaughter of soldiers. And in the
single combats between the two hosts, many warriors were slain on both
sides, men, Asuras, and Vidy&aacute;dharas. V&iacute;rasena slew
Dh&uacute;mralochana and his followers; but having been deprived of his
chariot, he was in his turn killed by Hari&#347;arman. Then the
Vidy&aacute;dhara hero Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha was killed by
Abhimanyu, but Abhimanyu and Haribha&#7789;a were slain by Sunetra. And
Sunetra was killed by Prabh&aacute;sa, who cut off his head. And
Jv&aacute;l&aacute;m&aacute;lin and Mah&aacute;yu killed one another.
But Kumbh&iacute;raka and Nir&aacute;saka fought with their teeth,
after their arms were cut off, and so did Kharva and the mighty
Su&#347;arman. And the three, <span class="corr" id="xd27e10207" title=
"Source: &#346;atrubhata">&#346;atrubha&#7789;a</span>, <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e10210" title=
"Source: Vy&aacute;ghra-bha&#7789;a">Vy&aacute;ghrabha&#7789;a</span>,
and Sinhabha&#7789;a were slain by Pravahana, the Vidy&aacute;dhara
king. Pravahana was killed by the two warriors Suroha and Viroha, and
those two were slain by Sinhabala, the dweller in the cemetery. That
very Sinhabala, whose chariot was drawn by ghosts, and Kapilaka, and
Chitr&aacute;p&iacute;&#7693;a the Vidy&aacute;dhara king, and
Jagajjvara, and the hero K&aacute;nt&aacute;pati, and the mighty
Suvar&#7751;a, and the two Vidy&aacute;dhara kings K&aacute;maghana and
Krodhapati, and king Baladeva and Vichitr&aacute;p&iacute;&#7693;a,
these ten were slain by the prince &#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka. When
these heroes had been slain, &#346;ruta&#347;arman, beholding the
slaughter of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, himself attacked
&#346;at&aacute;n&iacute;ka in his anger. Then a terrible fight took
place between those two, lasting to the close of the day, and causing a
great slaughter of soldiers, exciting the wonder even of the gods, and
it continued until hundreds of corpses, rising up all round, laid hold
of the demons as their partners, when the time arrived for the joyous
evening dance. At the close of day the Vidy&aacute;dharas, depressed at
the great slaughter of their army, and grieved at the death of their
friends, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>and the men and Asuras having won the victory by
sheer force stopped the combat, and went each of them to their own
camps.</p>
<p>At that time two Vidy&aacute;dharas, chiefs of captains of bands of
warriors, who had deserted the cause of &#346;ruta&#347;arman, came,
introduced by Sumeru, and said to S&uacute;ryaprabha, after bowing
before him: &ldquo;We are named Mah&aacute;y&aacute;na and
Sum&aacute;ya, and this Sinhabala was the third of us; we had obtained
magic power by having the rule of a great cemetery, and were
unassailable by the other Vidy&aacute;dharas. While we, such as you
have heard, were once taking our ease in a corner of the great
cemetery, there came to us a good witch named
&#346;arabh&aacute;nan&aacute;, of great and godlike power, who is
always well disposed towards us. We bowed before her and asked her,
&lsquo;Where have you been, honoured lady, and what have you seen there
strange?&rsquo; She thereupon related this adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Adventure of the witch
&#346;arabh&aacute;nan&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&lsquo;I went with the witches to visit my master, the
god Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10222src" href=
"#xd27e10222" name="xd27e10222src">5</a> and while I was there, a king
of the Vet&aacute;las came and reported: &ldquo;See, O master, the
chiefs of the Vidy&aacute;dharas have killed our commander-in-chief
named Agnika, and one named Tejah&#803;prabha is swiftly carrying off
his lovely daughter. But the holy sages have foretold that she shall be
the wife of the emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, so grant us a boon,
and have her released before he forcibly carries her off to a
distance.&rdquo; When the god heard this speech of the afflicted
Vet&aacute;la, he said to me&mdash;&ldquo;Go and set her free,&rdquo;
then I went through the air and came up with the maiden.
Tejah&#803;prabha said, &ldquo;I am carrying off the girl for our
rightful emperor &#346;ruta&#347;arman,&rdquo; but I paralyzed him by
my magic power, and bringing back the maiden, gave her to my master.
And he made her over to her own family. I in truth went through this
strange adventure. Then I remained there some days, and after taking a
reverent farewell of the god I came here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that witch &#346;arabh&aacute;nan&aacute; had said this,
we said to her&mdash;&lsquo;Tell us, who is to be the future emperor of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas? You in truth know all.&rsquo; She
said&mdash;&lsquo;S&uacute;ryaprabha will certainly be.&rsquo;
Whereupon Sinhabala said to us&mdash;&lsquo;This is untrue, for have
not the gods and Indra girded up their loins to support the cause of
&#346;ruta&#347;arman?&rsquo; When the noble woman heard that, she said
to us&mdash;&lsquo;If you do not believe this, listen; I tell you that
soon there will be war between S&uacute;ryaprabha and
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, and when this Sinhabala shall be slain before
your eyes by a man in battle, you will recognise this token, and will
know that this speech of mine is true.&rsquo; When that witch had said
this, she departed, and those days passed away, and now we have seen
with our own eyes, that in truth this Sinhabala has been slain. Relying
upon that, we think that you are indeed appointed emperor of all the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and submitting ourselves to your rule, we have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>repaired to your two lotus-like feet.&rdquo;
When the Vidy&aacute;dharas Mah&aacute;y&aacute;na and Sum&aacute;yaka
said this, S&uacute;ryaprabha, in concert with Maya and the rest,
received them into confidence and honoured them, and they rejoiced.
When &#346;ruta&#347;arman heard that, he was in great consternation,
but Indra comforted him by a message, sending to him
Vi&#347;v&aacute;vasu, and commissioning him to say&mdash;&ldquo;Be of
good cheer! To-morrow I will aid thee with all the gods in the van of
battle.&rdquo; This he said to him out of love, to comfort him. And
S&uacute;ryaprabha, having been encouraged by beholding the breaking of
his enemies&rsquo; line, and having seen in the front of battle the
slaughter of his rival&rsquo;s partisans, again forwent the society of
his charmers, and entered his dwelling at night surrounded by his
ministers.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, lying on his couch at night,
eager for battle, apart from his wives, said to his minister
V&iacute;tabh&iacute;ti&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot sleep, so tell me, my
friend, some strange story of courage and endurance, to amuse me during
the night.&rdquo; When V&iacute;tabh&iacute;ti heard this request of
S&uacute;ryaprabha&rsquo;s, he answered&mdash;&ldquo;I will obey your
order,&rdquo; and he told this story.</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of king Mah&aacute;sena and his virtuous
minister Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city Ujjayin&iacute;, the ornament of this
earth, full of numberless jewels of pellucid water. In that city there
lived a king named Mah&aacute;sena, beloved by the virtuous, an
unequalled treasury of accomplishments, having the beauty both of the
sun and moon. He had a wife named A&#347;okavat&iacute;, whom he loved
as his life, there was not another woman in the three worlds equal to
her in beauty. The king ruled his realm with her for consort, and he
had besides a friend, a Br&aacute;hman named Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman,
whom he respected and loved. And that Br&aacute;hman was brave and very
handsome, and, though young, had thoroughly mastered the lore of the
Vedas, and knew the accomplishments, the &#346;&aacute;stras, and the
use of weapons, and was always in attendance on the king.</p>
<p>And one day, as he was within the palace, a conversation arose about
dancing, and the king and queen said to Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, who was
in attendance,&mdash;&ldquo;You know everything, there is no doubt
about that; so we have a curiosity to see you dancing; if you know how
to dance, kindly exhibit your skill.&rdquo; When Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
heard this, he said with a smile on his face; &ldquo;I know how to
dance, but dancing is a thing not becoming in the king&rsquo;s court;
foolish dancing is generally ridiculous and is censured in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>&#346;&aacute;stras. And far from me be shame
here in the presence of the king and queen.&rdquo; When
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said that, the king answered him, being urged on
to it by the queen out of curiosity&mdash;&ldquo;This will not be like
a dance on the stage, or in such places, which would make a man feel
ashamed, but merely a private display of skill in the society of
friends. And at present I am not your king, I am your friend without
ceremony, so rest assured that I will not eat to-day, until I have seen
your skill in dancing.&rdquo; When the king pressed him in this style,
the Br&aacute;hman consented to do it. For how can servants refuse the
request of an importunate lord? Then that Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman danced
so skilfully with his body, that the hearts of both the king and queen
danced for joy. And, at the end of it, the king gave him a lyre to play
upon, and the moment he tested its tones, he said to the king,
&ldquo;This lyre is not in good order, so give me another one, there is
a puppy inside this, your Majesty,&mdash;I know that by the indications
of the twanging of the strings.&rdquo; Saying this,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman let go the lyre from under his arm. Then the king
sprinkled it, and unscrewed and examined it, and a puppy came out of
it. Then king Mah&aacute;sena praised Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&rsquo;s
omniscience, and was much astonished, and had another lyre brought. He
played on that lyre which, like the Ganges that flows in three
worlds,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10243src" href="#xd27e10243" name=
"xd27e10243src">1</a> was charming from its swift stream of
music,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10258src" href="#xd27e10258" name=
"xd27e10258src">2</a> and purged the ear by its sound. Then in presence
of the king, who with his wife looked on astonished, he exhibited in
turn his skill in the nobler studies. Then the king said to him,
&ldquo;If you are skilled in fighting, then shew me a specimen of the
art of binding the enemy&rsquo;s limbs with your own hands
unarmed.&rdquo; The Br&aacute;hman answered him&mdash;&ldquo;King, take
your weapons and strike at me, that I may shew you a specimen of my
skill.&rdquo; Then, as fast as the king took a sword or other weapon
and struck at him, Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, by that artifice of fettering
the limbs immediately disarmed him with ease, and frequently fettered
his hand and body, without receiving a wound. Then the king, seeing
that he was capable of aiding him in his political affairs, praised
that excellent Br&aacute;hman of transcendent ability, and honoured him
highly.</p>
<p>But queen A&#347;okavat&iacute;, having beheld again and again the
beauty and abilities of that Br&aacute;hman, suddenly fell in love with
him. She thought to herself, &ldquo;If I cannot obtain him, of what use
is my life to me.&rdquo; Then she artfully said to the
king&mdash;&ldquo;Do me a kindness, my husband, and order this
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman to teach me to play on the lyre. For when I
beheld to-day his skill in playing on the lyre, I took a desperate
fancy to the instrument.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he said to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&mdash;&ldquo;By all means teach <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>the
queen to play on the lyre.&rdquo; Then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said,
&ldquo;I will do so, my sovereign, we will begin the practising on an
auspicious day.&rdquo; Then he took leave of the king and went home.
But he put off for many days beginning to teach the queen the lyre,
seeing the changed expression of the queen, and afraid of some
mischief.</p>
<p>One day he was standing near the king when he was eating, and when
the cook was giving him some condiment, he prevented him, saying,
&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; The king asked what this meant, then the
discreet man said, &ldquo;This sauce is poisoned, and I detected it by
certain indications. For when the cook was giving you the sauce, he
looked at my face, trembling with fear, and with an eye that rolled
apprehensively. And we can at once find out whether I am right; let
this sauce be given to some one to eat, and I will counteract the
effect of the poison.&rdquo; When he said this, the king made the cook
eat the sauce, and immediately after he had eaten it, he became
senseless. Then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman counteracted the effect of the
poison on the cook by a spell, and when the king asked the cook the
truth of the whole matter, he said this&mdash;&ldquo;King, your enemy
king Vikrama&#347;akti, sovereign of Gau&#7693;a, sent me here to give
you poison. I introduced myself to your majesty as a foreigner skilful
in the culinary art, and entered your kitchen. So to-day I have been
discovered by that shrewd man in the act of giving you poison in sauce;
your majesty knows what to do now.&rdquo; When the cook said this, the
king punished him, and being much pleased, gave Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman a
thousand villages for saving his life.</p>
<p>And the next day, as the queen kept vigorously pressing him, the
king made Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman begin to teach her the lyre. Then,
while he was teaching her the lyre, the queen A&#347;okavat&iacute;
indulged in perpetual coquetry, laughter, and mirth. One day, wounded
with the arrow of love, she scratched him with her nails frequently in
secret, and said to the chaste Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, who entreated her
to desist, &ldquo;It was yourself that I asked for, handsome man, under
the pretext of learning to play the lute, for I am desperately in love
with you, so consent to my wishes.&rdquo; When she said this,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman answered her, &ldquo;Do not talk so, for you are
my master&rsquo;s wife, and such a one as I am should not commit such
treason, desist from this reckless conduct.&rdquo; When
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said this, the queen continued, &ldquo;Why do you
possess in vain this beauty and skill in accomplishments? How can you
look with a passionless eye on me who love you so much?&rdquo; When
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman heard this, he answered sarcastically, &ldquo;You
are right. What is the use of that beauty and skill, which is not
tarnished with infamy by seducing the wife of another, and which does
not in this world and the next cause one to fall into the ocean of
hell?&rdquo; When he said this, the queen said to him, pretending to be
angry, &ldquo;I am determined to die, if you do not do what I say, so
being despised by you, I will slay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462"
href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>you before I die.&rdquo; Then
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said, &ldquo;By all means, let it be so. For it
is better to live for one moment, bound by the bonds of righteousness,
than to live unrighteously for hundreds of crores of <i>kalpas</i>. And
it is far preferable for me to die without reproach, having done no
wrong, than for me to have done wrong, and to be put to death by the
king, with reproach attaching to my name.&rdquo; When the queen heard
that, she went on to say to him&mdash;&ldquo;Do not commit treason
against yourself<a id="xd27e10276" name="xd27e10276"></a> and me;
listen, I will tell you something. The king does not neglect to do what
I tell him, even if it is impossible; so I will ask him and get
territories given to you, and I will have all your servants made
barons, so you will become a king, for you are distinguished for good
qualities. So what have you to fear? Who can overpower you and how? So
grant my wishes fearlessly, otherwise you will not live.&rdquo; When
the king&rsquo;s wife said this, seeing that she was determined,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said to her artfully, in order to put her off for
a moment,&mdash;&ldquo;If you are persistently set on this, then I will
obey your command, but it will not be advisable to do so immediately,
for fear it should get abroad; wait for some days; believe that what I
say is true; what object have I in incurring your enmity which would
ensure my destruction?&rdquo; Thus Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman comforted her
with that hope, and agreed to her request, and then departed with heart
lightened.</p>
<p>Then, in the course of some days, king Mah&aacute;sena went and
surrounded king Somaka in his treasure-city. And when the king of
Gau&#7693;a, Vikrama&#347;akti, knew that he had arrived there, he went
and surrounded king Mah&aacute;sena; then king Mah&aacute;sena said to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&mdash;&ldquo;While we are occupied in besieging
one enemy we are besieged by another, so now how are we to fight with
two enemies, as we are unequal in force? And how long, being brave men,
can we remain without fighting a battle? So what are we to do in this
difficulty?&rdquo; When Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, who was at the side of
the king, was asked this question, he answered&mdash;&ldquo;Be of good
courage, my sovereign; I will devise a stratagem that will enable us to
get out of this situation, difficult as it is.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> He comforted the king with these words,
and put on his eyes an ointment that rendered him invisible, and at
night went, without any one seeing him, to the camp of
Vikrama&#347;akti. And he entered into his presence, and woke him up
while asleep, and said, &ldquo;Know, O king, that I am come a messenger
from the gods. Make peace with king Mah&aacute;sena and depart quickly,
otherwise you will certainly be destroyed here with your army. And if
you send an ambassador, he will agree to your proposals of peace; I
have been sent by the holy Vish&#7751;u to tell you this. For you are a
votary of his, and he watches over the safety of his votaries.&rdquo;
When king Vikrama&#347;akti heard this, he thought, &ldquo;Certainly
this is true, if he were any other, how could he enter this carefully
guarded tent? This is not what a mere mortal could accomplish.&rdquo;
When the king had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463</a>]</span>gone through these reflections, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;I am fortunate in receiving such a command from the
god, I will do what he bids me.&rdquo; When the king said that,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman disappeared by the help of his magic collyrium,
thus confirming the king&rsquo;s confidence in him, and went away. And
he came and told king Mah&aacute;sena what he had done; he threw his
arms round his neck, and hailed him as the preserver of his life and
throne. And the next morning Vikrama&#347;akti sent an ambassador to
Mah&aacute;sena, and after making peace with him, returned home with
his army. But Mah&aacute;sena conquered Somaka, and having obtained
elephants and horses, returned to Ujjayin&iacute; a victor, thanks to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman. And while he was there, Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
saved him from a crocodile while bathing in the river, and from the
poison of a snake-bite while in his garden.</p>
<p>Then, after some days had passed, king Mah&aacute;sena, having got
together an army, went to attack his enemy Vikrama&#347;akti. And that
king, as soon as he heard of his approach, marched out to meet him in
fight, and a great battle took place between the two. And in the course
of it, the two kings met in single combat, and disabled one
another&rsquo;s chariots. Then, in their fury, they rushed forward
sword in hand, and king Mah&aacute;sena through carelessness stumbled
and fell on the earth. Then the king Vikrama&#347;akti tried to strike
him on the ground, but Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman cut off his arm with a
discus, sword and all, and striking him again in the heart with an iron
mace laid him low. And king Mah&aacute;sena rose up, and was pleased
when he saw his enemy dead, and said repeatedly to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&mdash;&ldquo;What am I to say? This is the fifth
time that you have saved my life, heroic Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo; Then
Mah&aacute;sena conquered the army and kingdom of Vikrama&#347;akti,
who had been slain by Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, and after overcoming other
kings by the aid of Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, he returned to
Ujjayin&iacute; and dwelt there in happiness.</p>
<p>But queen A&#347;okavat&iacute; did not cease from importunately
soliciting Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman day and night. But he would never
consent to that crime; good men prefer death to immodest conduct. Then
A&#347;okavat&iacute;, finding out that he was resolved, one day out of
enmity to him affected to be unhappy, and remained with tearful
countenance. Then Mah&aacute;sena, coming in, and seeing her in that
condition, said&mdash;&ldquo;What is this, my beloved? Who has offended
you? Tell me the name of the man whose life and property I am to take
by way of punishment?&rdquo; Then the unforgiving queen said with
affected reluctance to the king, who had thus addressed her, &ldquo;You
have no power to punish the man who has injured me; he is not a man you
can chastise, so what is the good of revealing the injury to no
purpose?&rdquo; When she said this, the king pressed her, and she said
deceitfully&mdash;&ldquo;My husband, if you are very anxious to know,
listen, I will tell you. Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, who pretends to be a
loyal servant,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10289src" href="#xd27e10289"
name="xd27e10289src">3</a> made an agreement <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name="pb464">464</a>]</span>with
the King of Gau&#7693;a, and in order to get money from him, undertook
to do you an injury. The wicked Br&aacute;hman secretly sent his
confidential messenger to Gau&#7693;a, to make the king hand over
treasure and so on. Then a confidential servant, seeing the king
despondent, said to him&mdash;&lsquo;I will manage this affair for you,
do not waste your wealth.&rsquo; When the king of Gau&#7693;a heard
this, he had that messenger of Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&rsquo;s cast into
prison,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10308src" href="#xd27e10308" name=
"xd27e10308src">4</a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>and the cook who was to administer the poison came here, carefully
keeping the secret. In the meanwhile Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&rsquo;s
messenger escaped from prison, and came here to him. And he, knowing
the whole story, revealed it all, and pointed out to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10315src" href=
"#xd27e10315" name="xd27e10315src">5</a> that cook, who had entered
into our kitchen. Then that scoundrelly Br&aacute;hman detected the
cook in the act of administering the poison, and denounced him to you,
and so had him put to death. Then the mother and the wife and the
younger brother of that cook came here to find out what had become of
him, and the sagacious Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, finding it out, put to
death his wife and mother, but his brother escaped somehow or other and
entered my palace. While he was imploring my protection and telling me
the whole story, Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman entered my apartment. When the
brother of that cook saw Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman and heard his name, he
went out and fled from my presence, whither I know not.
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, for his part, when he saw him who had been
previously pointed out to him by his servants, was abashed and seemed
to be thinking over something. And I, wanting to know what it was, said
to him in private, &lsquo;Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, why do you seem to be
altered to-day?&rsquo; And he, being anxious to win me over to his
side, as he was afraid of the matter being revealed, said to
me&mdash;&lsquo;Queen, I am consumed with passion for you, so consent
to my wishes, otherwise I cannot live; bestow on me life as a
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s fee.&rsquo; When he had said this, as the room
was empty, he fell at my feet. Then I drew away my foot and rose up in
bewilderment, and he, rising up, embraced me, a weak woman, by force.
And my maid Pallavik&aacute; came in at that very moment. The instant
he saw her, he fled out alarmed. If Pallavik&aacute; had not come in,
the villain would certainly have outraged me.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10324src" href="#xd27e10324" name="xd27e10324src">6</a> This is
the injury he has done me to-day.&rdquo; When the queen had told this
false tale, she stopped and wept. For in the beginning wicked women
sprang from Lying Speech. And the moment the king heard it, he was all
on fire with anger, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href=
"#pb465" name="pb465">465</a>]</span>reliance upon the words of women
destroys the discrimination even of the great. And he said to his dear
wife, &ldquo;Be comforted, fair one, I will certainly punish that
traitor with death. But he must be slain by artifice, otherwise we
might be disgraced, for it is well known that five times he has saved
my life. And we must not proclaim abroad his crime of offering violence
to you.&rdquo; When the king said this to the queen, she
answered&mdash;&ldquo;If that crime may not be published, may that
other one of his be published, that out of friendship for the king of
Gau&#7693;a he attempted treason against his master?&rdquo; When she
said this, he answered&mdash;&ldquo;You are quite
right&rdquo;&mdash;and so king Mah&aacute;sena went to his hall of
audience.</p>
<p>Then all the kings, and princes, and barons came to visit the king.
And in the meanwhile Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman left his house to go to
court, and on the way he saw many unfavourable omens. There was a crow
on his left hand, a dog ran from the left to the right, a snake
appeared on his right, and his left arm and shoulder throbbed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10342src" href="#xd27e10342" name=
"xd27e10342src">7</a> He thought to himself, &ldquo;These evil omens
indicate calamity to me without doubt, so whatever happens to me, I
hope no misfortune may befall the king my master.&rdquo; With these
thoughts he entered the hall of audience, and prayed loyally that
nothing untoward might befall the palace. But when he bowed and took
his seat, the king did not salute him as before, but looked askance at
him with an eye glowing with anger. And when Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman was
alarmed as to what it might mean, the king rose up from the seat of
justice, and sat at his side, and said to the astonished courtiers,
&ldquo;Hear what Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman has done to me;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10356src" href="#xd27e10356" name=
"xd27e10356src">8</a> then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said&mdash;&ldquo;I am
a servant, you are my master, so how can our suit be equal, ascend your
seat of judgment, and afterwards give what order you like.&rdquo; When
the resolute man said this, the king, by the advice of the other
ministers, ascended the seat of judgment, and said again to his
courtiers&mdash;&ldquo;You know, that I made this Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
equal to myself, preferring him to my hereditary ministers. Now hear
what treason he attempted to commit against me, after making an
agreement with the king of Gau&#7693;a by sending messengers to and
fro.&rdquo; After saying this, the king related to them all the
fictitious account of the matter which A&#347;okavat&iacute; had given
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>him. And the king also told to his confidential
ministers, after dismissing the crowd, the lying tale of an attempt to
outrage her, which she had told against Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman. Then
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said&mdash;&ldquo;King, who told you such a
falsehood, who painted this aerial picture?&rdquo; When the king heard
that, he said, &ldquo;Villain, if it is not true, how did you know that
the poison was in the dish of rice?&rdquo; When Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
said&mdash;&ldquo;Everything is known by wisdom,&rdquo; the other
ministers, out of hatred to him, said, &ldquo;That is
impossible.&rdquo; Then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said, &ldquo;King, you
have no right to speak thus without enquiring into the truth of the
matter, and a king devoid of discrimination is not approved of by those
who understand policy.&rdquo; When he repeated this over and over
again, the king exclaimed that he was an insolent wretch, and aimed a
sword-cut at him. But he avoided that blow by employing his trick of
fence, and then the other followers of the king struck at him. And he
eluded their swords by his artifices of fence, and baffled the
exertions of them all. And he fettered them, binding them with one
another&rsquo;s hair, shewing wonderful skill in the employment of his
trick of disarming. And he made his way out by force from that hall of
assembly of the king, and he killed about a hundred warriors, who
pursued him. Then he put on his eyes that ointment serving to render
him invisible, which he had in the corner of his garment, and
immediately left that country without being seen. And he made towards
the Dekhan, and as he was going along, he thus reflected on the way:
&ldquo;Surely that foolish king was set on by that
A&#347;okavat&iacute;. Alas! women whose love is slighted are worse
than poison! Alas! kings who do not investigate the truth are not to be
served by the good!&rdquo; While engaged in such reflections,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman came at last to a village, there he saw a worthy
Br&aacute;hman under a banyan-tree teaching his pupils. He went up to
him and hailed him. And the Br&aacute;hman, after welcoming him,
immediately asked him, &ldquo;O Br&aacute;hman, what recension of the
Vedas do you recite, tell me.&rdquo; Then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
answered that Br&aacute;hman,&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I recite
twelve recensions, two of the S&aacute;maveda, two of the
&#7770;igveda, seven of the Yajurveda, and one of the
Atharvaveda.&rdquo; Then the Br&aacute;hman said&mdash;&ldquo;You must
be a god,&rdquo; and he went on to say to Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, whose
shape revealed his excellence; &ldquo;Tell me, what country and what
family did you adorn by being born in them? What is your name and how
did you learn so much?&rdquo; When Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman heard this, he
said to him:</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman the father of
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Ujjayin&iacute; there was a
Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son named &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman, and when he
was a child, his father died, and his mother entered the fire with her
husband. Then &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman grew up in that city, in his
uncle&rsquo;s house, reading the Vedas, and the books of knowledge, and
also the treatises on accomplishments. And after he had acquired
knowledge, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>was engaged in a vow of muttering prayers, he
struck up a friendship with a certain wandering hermit. That wandering
hermit went with his friend &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman, and performed a
sacrifice in a cemetery to get a Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; into his power.
Then a heavenly maiden, beautifully adorned, appeared to him in a
chariot of gold, surrounded with beautiful maidens. She said to him in
a sweet voice, &ldquo;Mendicant, I am a Yaksh&iacute; named
Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute;, and these others are Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;s.
Take a suitable wife from my following according to your pleasure. So
much have you obtained by your employment of spells; you have not
discovered the perfect spell for obtaining me; so, as I am obtained by
that only, do not take any further trouble to no purpose.&rdquo; When
the Yaksh&iacute; said this to him, the mendicant consented, and chose
one Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; from her retinue. Then
Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute; disappeared, and &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman
asked that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, whom the hermit had obtained,
&ldquo;Is there any Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; superior to
Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute;?&rdquo; When the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; heard
that, she answered, &ldquo;Yes, handsome man, there is.
Vidyunm&aacute;l&aacute;, Chandralekh&aacute;, and Sulochan&aacute; the
third, are the best among the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;s, and among these
Sulochan&aacute;.&rdquo; After saying that, the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;
departed, to return at the appointed time; and the mendicant went with
&Aacute;ditya&#347;arman to his house. There the loving
Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; every day visited the hermit at the appointed
time, and granted him all that he desired. One day
&Aacute;ditya&#347;arman asked her this question by the mouth of that
mendicant: &ldquo;Who knows the proper spell for attracting
Sulochan&aacute;?&rdquo; And the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute; sent him this
message by the mouth of the mendicant&mdash;&ldquo;There is a place
called Jambuvana in the south. There is a mendicant there, named
Vish&#7751;ugupta, who has made his dwelling on the banks of the
Ve&#7751;&iacute;; he is the best of Buddhist mendicants, and knows the
spell at full length.&rdquo; When &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman learned this
from the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, he went in all eagerness to that
country, followed by the mendicant out of love. There he duly searched
for the Buddhist mendicant, and after he had approached him, he served
him devotedly for three years, and waited upon him continually. And by
the help of that Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;, who was at the beck and call of
the first mendicant, his friend, he provided him with heavenly
luxuries, ministered seasonably. Then that Buddhist mendicant, being
pleased, gave to that &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman the spell for obtaining
Sulochan&aacute;, which he desired, together with the prescribed rites
to accompany it. Then &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman, having obtained that
spell, and having duly employed it, went into a solitary place and
performed there the final sacrifice according to the prescribed ritual,
leaving no ceremony out. Then the Yakshi&#7751;&iacute;
Sulochan&aacute; appeared to him in an air-chariot, with
world-enchanting beauty, and said to him, &ldquo;Come! come! I have
been won by you, but you must not make me your wife for six months,
great hero, if you wish to have by me a son, who will be a favourite of
fortune, marked with auspicious marks, all-knowing and
invincible.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468"
name="pb468">468</a>]</span>When she said this,
&Aacute;ditya&#347;arman consented<span class="corr" id="xd27e10376"
title="Source: .">,</span> and she took him off in her chariot to
Alak&aacute;. And &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman remained there, looking at
her ever near him, with his suspense and doubts at an end, and
performed for six months a vow as difficult as standing on the edge of
a sword. Then the god of wealth, being pleased, himself gave that
Sulochan&aacute; to &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman according to a heavenly
ritual. I was born as that Br&aacute;hman&rsquo;s son by her, and I was
named Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman by my father on account of my good
qualities. Then in that very place I learned in succession the Vedas,
the sciences, and the accomplishments, from a prince of the Yakshas
named Ma&#7751;idara.</p>
<p>Then, once upon a time, it happened that Indra came to the god of
wealth, and all who sat there rose up when they saw him. But as Fate
would have it, &Aacute;ditya&#347;arman my father was at that time
thinking of something else, and did not rise up in a hurry. Then Indra,
being angry, cursed him, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Out, fool! go to your
own world of mortals, you are out of place here.&rdquo; Then
Sulochan&aacute; fell at his feet, and propitiated him, and Indra
answered, &ldquo;Then let him not go to the world of mortals himself,
but let this son of his go, for one&rsquo;s son is said to be a second
self. Let not my word have been spoken in vain.&rdquo; When Indra had
said so much, he was satisfied. Then my father took me and deposited me
in my uncle&rsquo;s house in Ujjayin&iacute;. For what is ordained to
be a man&rsquo;s lot must be. There, as it happened, I struck up a
friendship with the king of that place. And listen, I will tell you
what happened to me there afterwards.</p>
<p>After saying this, he described to him what happened from the very
beginning, and what A&#347;okavat&iacute; did, and what the king did,
ending up with his fight. And he went on to say to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, thus I have fled away to go to a
foreign land, and on my way, as I was journeying along, I have seen
you.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he said to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman&mdash;&ldquo;And thus I have become fortunate by
your visit, my lord. So now come to my house, and know that I am
Agnidatta by name, and this village is my grant from the king; be at
ease here.&rdquo; After saying this, Agnidatta made
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman enter his splendid mansion, in which were many
cows, buffaloes, and horses. There he honoured that guest with bath and
unguents, and robes and ornaments, and with various kinds of food. And
he shewed him his daughter, Sundar&iacute; by name, whose beauty was to
be desired even by the gods, on the pretence of getting him to inspect
her marks. And Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, for his part, seeing that she was
unsurpassed in beauty, said &ldquo;She will have rival wives. She has a
mole on her nose, and consequently I assert that she must have a second
one on her breast; and men say that such is the result of spots in
these two localities.&rdquo; When he said this, her brother, by command
of her father, uncovered her breast, and beheld there a mole.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Agnidatta said in astonishment to Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman,
&ldquo;You are all-knowing, but these moles of hers portend good
fortune to us. For wives generally have many rivals when the husband is
fortunate, a poor<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10386src" href=
"#xd27e10386" name="xd27e10386src">9</a> man would find it difficult to
support one, much more to support many.&rdquo; When
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman heard this, he answered him&mdash;&ldquo;It is as
you say; how could ill fortune befall a shape with such auspicious
marks?&rdquo; When he had said this, Agnidatta took occasion to ask him
concerning the meaning of moles and other marks; and he told him what
moles and other marks portended on every single limb, both in men and
women.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10394src" href="#xd27e10394" name=
"xd27e10394src">10</a></p>
<p>Then Sundar&iacute;, the moment she beheld Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman,
longed eagerly to drink him in with her eyes, as the female partridge
longs to drink the moon. Then Agnidatta said in private to
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, &ldquo;Illustrious one, I give you this my
daughter Sundar&iacute;. Do not go to a foreign land, remain at ease in
my house.&rdquo; When Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman heard this speech of his,
he said to him&mdash;&ldquo;True, I should be happy enough to do so,
but as I have been on a false charge scorched with the fire of the
king&rsquo;s contempt, it does not please me. A lovely woman, the
rising of the moon, and the fifth note of a lute, these delight the
happy but afflict the miserable. And a wife, who falls in love of her
own accord with a man, is sure to be chaste, but if she is given away
by her father against her will, she will be like A&#347;okavat&iacute;.
Moreover, the city of Ujjayin&iacute; is near to this place, so the
king may perhaps hear of my whereabouts and oppress me. So I will
wander round to holy places, and will wash off the stains of sin
contracted ever since my birth, and will abandon this body, then I
shall be at rest.&rdquo; When he said this, Agnidatta answered him,
smiling, &ldquo;If even you show so much infatuation, what are we to
expect from others? What annoyance can you, a man of pure character,
derive from the contempt of a fool? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb470" href="#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span>Mud thrown at the
heaven falls upon the head of the thrower. The king will soon reap the
fruit of his want of discrimination, for Fortune does not long wait
upon a man blind with infatuation and wanting in discrimination.
Besides, if you are disgusted with women from your experience of
A&#347;okavat&iacute;, do you not feel respect for them on beholding a
good woman, for you know signs? And even though Ujjayin&iacute; be near
to this place where you now are, I will take steps to prevent any
one&rsquo;s knowing that you are here. But if you desire to make a
pilgrimage to sacred places, then I say&mdash;that is approved by the
wise only for a man, who cannot, according to the scriptures, attain
happiness by performing the actions enjoined by the Vedas; but he who
can acquire merit by offerings to the gods, to the manes of deceased
ancestors, and to the fire, by vows, and muttering prayers, what is the
use of his wandering about on pilgrimages? A pilgrim whose pillow is
his arm, who sleeps upon the ground, and lives on alms, and drinks only
water, is not free from cares, even though he has attained equality
with hermits. And as for your desiring to abandon the body,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10419src" href="#xd27e10419" name=
"xd27e10419src">11</a> in this also you are led astray, for in the next
world suicides suffer more severe pains than here. An unbecoming fault
and folly is not to be committed by one so young and wise: decide for
yourself: you must certainly do what I tell you. I will have made for
you here a spacious and beautiful subterranean dwelling; marry
Sundar&iacute; and live at ease in it.&rdquo; When he was thus
diligently schooled by Agnidatta, Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman agreed to his
proposal, and said to him, &ldquo;I accept your offer, for who would
abandon a wife like Sundar&iacute;?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10428src" href="#xd27e10428" name="xd27e10428src">12</a> But I
will not marry this your daughter till I have accomplished my ends. In
the meanwhile I will propitiate some god with strict asceticism, in
order that I may be revenged on that ungrateful monarch.&rdquo; When he
said this, Agnidatta gladly consented, and Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman rested
there in comfort during the night. And the next day Agnidatta had a
secret subterranean dwelling constructed for his comfort, called
P&aacute;t&aacute;lavasati.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10433src" href=
"#xd27e10433" name="xd27e10433src">13</a> And while he was there,
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said in secret to Agnidatta: &ldquo;Tell me, what
god, granting boons to his worshippers, shall I propitiate here by
performing vows, and what spell shall I use?&rdquo; When the brave man
said that, Agnidatta answered him, &ldquo;I have a spell for
propitiating the god Sv&aacute;mikum&aacute;ra, which was told me by a
teacher; so with that propitiate the general of the gods, the foe of
T&aacute;raka, desiring whose birth the gods, oppressed by their
enemies, sent K&aacute;ma to &#346;iva, (and he, after burning him up,
decreed that henceforth he should be born in the mind;) whose origin
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>they say was various, from &#346;iva, from the
fire-cavity, from fire, from the thicket of reeds and from the
K&#7771;ittik&aacute;s; and who, as soon as he was born, made the whole
world bend by his irresistible might, and slew the unconquered Asura
T&aacute;raka.&rdquo; Then Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman said, &ldquo;Tell me
that spell.&rdquo; And <span class="corr" id="xd27e10447" title=
"Source: &Aacute;gnidatta">Agnidatta</span> gave Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
that spell. With it Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman propitiated Skanda in the
subterranean dwelling, unremitting in his vow, waited upon by
Sundar&iacute;. Then the six-faced god appeared to him in visible form,
and said, &ldquo;I am pleased with you, choose a boon,&mdash;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10450src" href="#xd27e10450" name=
"xd27e10450src">14</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>You shall possess an inexhaustible treasury and, after conquering
Mah&aacute;sena, you shall, my son, advance irresistibly and rule the
earth.&rdquo; After giving him this great boon, Skanda disappeared, and
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman obtained inexhaustible treasure. Then the
successful hero married, according to the prescribed rites, with
splendour suited to his greatness, the daughter of the Br&aacute;hman
Agnidatta, who fell more in love with him every day, like his future
good fortune in affairs come to him in bodily form. And then having
collected, by virtue of his surpassing accumulation of inexhaustible
treasure, an army consisting of many horses, elephants and
foot-soldiers, he marched to Ujjayin&iacute;, overrunning the earth
with the forces of all the kings that crowded to his banner out of
gratitude for his gifts. And after proclaiming there to the subjects
that immodest conduct of A&#347;okavat&iacute;, and after conquering
the king Mah&aacute;sena in battle, and deposing him from the throne,
he obtained the dominion of the earth. And king Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman
married many daughters of kings, besides Sundar&iacute;, and his orders
were obeyed even on the shores of the sea, and with Sundar&iacute; as
his consort he long enjoyed pleasures to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus king Mah&aacute;sena, in old time, suddenly incurred
calamity through being unable to discriminate the characters of men,
being a man of dull intellect, but the clear-headed
Gu&#7751;a&#347;arman, with the help of his own resolute character
alone, obtained the highest prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After S&uacute;ryaprabha had heard this chivalrous tale at night
from the mouth of his minister V&iacute;tabh&iacute;ti, the royal hero,
who was longing to traverse the great sea of battle, gained great
confidence, and gradually dropped off to sleep. <span class=

belief was formerly current throughout the country in the significance
of moles on the human body. When one of these appeared on the upper
side of the right temple above the eye, to a woman it signified good
and happy fortune by marriage. This superstition was especially
believed in in Nottinghamshire, as we learn from the following lines,

<p class="first">Then S&uacute;ryaprabha and his ministers rose up
early in the morning, and accompanied by all the troops of the
D&aacute;navas and their allies, went to the field of battle. And
&#346;ruta&#347;arman came surrounded by all the forces of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas; and all the gods, Asuras, and others again came to
look on. Both armies adopted the crescent formation, then there took
place a battle between those two armies. The swift arrows,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10468src" href="#xd27e10468" name=
"xd27e10468src">1</a> winged with feathers, clashing against one
another and cutting one another in pieces, also fought. The long
sword-blades issued from the mouths of the scabbards, and drinking
blood, and waving to and fro, appeared like the tongues of Death. The
field of battle seemed like a lake, the full-blown lotuses of which
were the faces of heroes; on these the shower of discuses descended
like a flight of Brahmany ducks, and so ruined the kingly swans. The
combat appeared, with the severed heads of heroes flying up and down,
like a game of ball, with which Death was amusing himself. When the
arena of combat was cleared from the obscuring dust by the sprinkling
of bloody drops, there took place on it the single combats of furious
champions. There S&uacute;ryaprabha fought with &#346;ruta&#347;arman,
and Prabh&aacute;sa fought with D&aacute;modara, and Siddh&aacute;rtha
fought with Mahotp&aacute;ta, and Prahasta with Brahmagupta, and
V&iacute;tabh&iacute; with Sangama, and Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya with
Chandragupta, and Priyankara with &Aacute;krama, and Sarvadamana fought
with Atibala, and Kunjarakum&aacute;raka fought with Dhurandhara, and
other great champions fought with others respectively.</p>
<p>Then first Mahotp&aacute;ta silenced the arrows of Siddh&aacute;rtha
with his arrows, and after cleaving his bow, slew his horses and
charioteer. Siddh&aacute;rtha, though deprived of his chariot, charged
him angrily, and with a large iron mace broke in pieces his chariot and
horses. Then Siddh&aacute;rtha fought on foot with Mahotp&aacute;ta
also on foot, and in a wrestling-bout hurled him to the ground. But
while he was trying to crush him, that Vidy&aacute;dhara was delivered
by his father Bhaga, and flying up into the air left the battle-field.
And Prahasta and Brahmagupta destroyed one another&rsquo;s chariots,
and then fought with swords, shewing various arts of fence; and
Prahasta cleft his foe&rsquo;s shield in the course of their
sword-play, and with a dexterous sleight laid him low on the earth; but
when he was about to cut off his head, as he lay on the ground, he was
forbidden by his father Brahm&aacute; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb473" href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>himself by a sign
from a distance; then all the D&aacute;navas laughed the gods to scorn,
saying, &ldquo;You gods have come to save your sons, not to behold the
fray.&rdquo; In the meanwhile V&iacute;tabhaya, after cutting in two
the bow of Sankrama, and slaying his charioteer, slew him by piercing
his heart with the weapon of K&aacute;ma. And Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya,
fighting on foot with Chandragupta, sword to sword, after both their
chariots had been destroyed, killed him by cutting off his head. Then
the Moon, angry at the death of his son, himself came and fought with
Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya, and the two combatants were evenly matched.
And Priyankara, who had lost his chariot, fighting with &Aacute;krama,
who had also had his chariot destroyed, cut him in two with one blow of
his sword. And Sarvadamana easily killed Atibala in fight, for when his
bow was cleft, he threw his elephant-hook and smote him in the
heart.</p>
<p>Then Kunjarakum&aacute;ra in a contest, in which missiles were
opposed by answering missiles, frequently deprived Dhurandhara of his
chariot, and as frequently Vikrama&#347;akti brought him a chariot, and
defended him in sore straits, repelling weapons with weapons; then
Kunjarakum&aacute;ra in wrath rushed forward, and swiftly hurled a
great rock on to the chariot of Vikrama&#347;akti, and, when
Vikrama&#347;akti retired with broken chariot, he crushed Dhurandhara
with that very stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10481src" href=
"#xd27e10481" name="xd27e10481src">2</a></p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, while fighting with &#346;ruta&#347;arman,
being angry on account of the slaughter of Virochana, killed Dama with
one arrow. Enraged at that, the two A&#347;vins descended to the
combat, but Sun&iacute;tha received them with showers of arrows, and a
great fight took place between him and them. And Sthirabuddhi slew
Par&aacute;krama in fight with a javelin, and then fought with the
eight Vasus enraged on account of his death. And Prabh&aacute;sa,
seeing Bh&aacute;sa deprived of his chariot, though himself engaged in
fighting with D&aacute;modara, killed Mardana with one arrow. The
D&aacute;nava Prakampana killed Tejah&#803;prabha in a missile combat,
and then fought with the god of Fire enraged on account of his death.
And when Dh&uacute;mraketu had slain Yamadansh&#7789;ra in fight, he
had a terrible combat with the enraged Yama.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10488src" href="#xd27e10488" name="xd27e10488src">3</a> And
Sinhadansh&#7789;ra, having crushed Surosha&#7751;a with a stone,
fought with Nir&#7771;iti,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10491src" href=
"#xd27e10491" name="xd27e10491src">4</a> enraged on account of his
death. K&aacute;lachakra also cut V&aacute;yubala in two with a discus,
and then fought with V&aacute;yu<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10496src"
href="#xd27e10496" name="xd27e10496src">5</a> inflamed with rage
thereat. And Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya slew Kuveradatta, who deluded his
foes by assuming the forms of a snake, a mountain, and a tree, assuming
himself the forms of Garu&#7693;a, of the thunderbolt, and of fire.
Then Kuvera<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10501src" href="#xd27e10501"
name="xd27e10501src">6</a> himself fought with him in wrath. In the
same way all the gods fought, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474"
href="#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span>angry on account of the
slaughter of their sons. And then various other princes of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas were slain by various men and D&aacute;navas,
darting forward from time to time.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile a conflict went on between Prabh&aacute;sa and
D&aacute;modara, terrible from its unceasing exchange of missiles. Then
D&aacute;modara, though his bow was cleft asunder, and his charioteer
slain, took another bow and fought on, holding the reins in his own
hands. And when Brahm&aacute; applauded him, Indra said to him,
&ldquo;Revered one, why are you pleased with one who is getting the
worst of it?&rdquo; Then Brahm&aacute; answered him,&mdash;&ldquo;How
can I help being pleased with one, who fights for so long with this
Prabh&aacute;sa? Who but D&aacute;modara, who is a portion of Hari,
would do this? For all the gods would be a scant match for
Prabh&aacute;sa in fight. For that Asura Namuchi, who was so hard for
the gods to subdue, and who was then born again as Prabala, one entire
and perfect jewel, has now been born as the invincible Prabh&aacute;sa
son of Bh&aacute;sa, and Bh&aacute;sa too was in a former birth the
great Asura K&aacute;lanemi, who afterwards became
Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and then Kapinjala. And S&uacute;ryaprabha is
the Asura who was called Sumu&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;ka. And the Asura
who was before called Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha is now this
Sun&iacute;tha. And as for Prahasta and others, they are all Daityas
and D&aacute;navas; and since the Asuras slain by you have been born
again in these forms, the other Asuras, Maya and others, have espoused
their cause. And see, Bali has come here to look on, for his bonds have
been broken by virtue of the great sacrifice to &#346;iva, duly
performed by S&uacute;ryaprabha and the others, but keeping his promise
faithfully, he remains content with the realm of P&aacute;t&aacute;la
until your allotted period of rule is at an end, and then he will be
Indra. These are now favoured by &#346;iva, so it is not now a time of
victory for you, make peace with your foes.&rdquo; While Brahm&aacute;
was saying this to the king of the gods, Prabh&aacute;sa sent forth the
great weapon of &#346;iva. When Vish&#7751;u saw that terrible
all-destroying weapon let loose, he also sent forth, out of regard for
his son, his discus called Sudar&#347;ana. Then there took place
between those divine weapons, which had assumed visible shapes, a
struggle which made the three worlds dread a sudden destruction of all
creatures. Then Hari said to Prabh&aacute;sa&mdash;&ldquo;Recall your
weapon and I will recall mine,&rdquo; and Prabh&aacute;sa answered
him,&mdash;&ldquo;My weapon cannot be launched in vain, so let
D&aacute;modara turn his back, and retire from the fight, and then I
will recall my weapon.&rdquo; When Prabh&aacute;sa said that,
Vish&#7751;u answered&mdash;&ldquo;Then do you also honour my discus,
let not either of these weapons be fruitless.&rdquo; When Vish&#7751;u
said this, Prabh&aacute;sa who possessed tact, said &ldquo;So be it,
let this discus of thine destroy my chariot.&rdquo; Vish&#7751;u
agreed, and made D&aacute;modara retire from the fight, and
Prabh&aacute;sa withdrew his weapon, and the discus fell on his
chariot. Then he mounted another chariot and went to
S&uacute;ryaprabha, and then D&aacute;modara, for his part, repaired to
&#346;ruta&#347;arman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href=
"#pb475" name="pb475">475</a>]</span></p>
<p>And then the single combat between &#346;ruta&#347;arman, who was
puffed up by being a son of Indra, and S&uacute;ryaprabha, became
exceedingly fierce. Whatever weapon &#346;ruta&#347;arman vigorously
employed, S&uacute;ryaprabha immediately repelled with opposing
weapons. And whatever delusion &#346;ruta&#347;arman employed, was
overmastered by S&uacute;ryaprabha with opposing delusion. Then
&#346;ruta&#347;arman in fierce wrath sent forth the weapon of
Brahm&aacute;, and the mighty S&uacute;ryaprabha let loose the weapon
of &#346;iva. That mighty weapon of &#346;iva repelled the weapon of
Brahm&aacute;, and being irresistible, was overpowering
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, when Indra and the other Lokap&aacute;las, being
indignant, sent forth their tremendous weapons beginning with
thunderbolts. But the weapon of &#346;iva conquered all those weapons,
and blazed exceedingly, eager to slay &#346;ruta&#347;arman. Then
S&uacute;ryaprabha praised that great weapon, and entreated it not to
kill &#346;ruta&#347;arman, but to take him prisoner and hand him over
to himself. Then all the gods speedily prepared for fight, and the
other Asuras also, who had come to look on, did the same, being eager
to conquer the gods. Then a Ga&#7751;a named V&iacute;rabhadra, sent by
&#346;iva, came and delivered this order of his to Indra and the other
gods: &ldquo;You came to look on, so what right have you to fight here?
Moreover, your overstepping the bounds of propriety will produce other
bad results.&rdquo; When the gods heard that, they
said&mdash;&ldquo;All of us have sons here that have been slain, or are
being slain, so how can we help fighting?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10511src" href="#xd27e10511" name="xd27e10511src">7</a> Love for
one&rsquo;s offspring is a feeling hard to lay aside, so we must
certainly revenge ourselves on their slayers to the utmost of our
power; what impropriety is there in this?&rdquo; When the gods said
this, V&iacute;rabhadra departed, and a great fight took place between
the gods and the Asuras: Sun&iacute;tha fought with the two
A&#347;vins, and Prajn&aacute;&#7693;hya fought with the Moon, and
Sthirabuddhi with the Vasus, and K&aacute;lachakra with V&aacute;yu,
and Prakampana with Agni, and Sinhadansh&#7789;ra with Nir&#7771;iti,
and Pramathana with Varu&#7751;a, and Dh&uacute;mraketu with Yama, and
then Mah&aacute;m&aacute;ya fought with the god of wealth, and other
Asuras<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10514src" href="#xd27e10514" name=
"xd27e10514src">8</a> at the same time fought with other gods, with
missiles and opposing missiles. And finally, whatever mighty weapon any
god sent forth, &#346;iva immediately destroyed with an angry roar. But
the god of wealth, when his club was uplifted, was restrained by
&#346;iva in a conciliatory manner, while various other gods, their
weapons having been broken, fled from the field of battle. Then Indra
himself, in wrath, attacked S&uacute;ryaprabha, and let fly a storm of
arrows at him and various other weapons. And S&uacute;ryaprabha
repelled those weapons with ease, and kept striking Indra with hundreds
of arrows drawn back to the ear. Then the king of the gods, enraged,
seized his thunderbolt, and &#346;iva made an angry noise and destroyed
that thunderbolt. Then Indra turned his back and fled, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name="pb476">476</a>]</span>and
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;a himself, in wrath, attacked
Prabh&aacute;sa with sharp-edged<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10525src"
href="#xd27e10525" name="xd27e10525src">9</a> arrows. And he fearlessly
fought with him, opposing those and other missiles with his own
missiles, and when his horses were slain, and he was deprived of his
chariot, he ascended another, and still fought with that enemy of the
Daityas on equal terms. Then the god enraged sent forth his flaming
discus. And Prabh&aacute;sa sent forth a heavenly sword, after
consecrating it with magic formulas. While those two weapons were
contending, &#346;iva, seeing that the sword was gradually being
overpowered by the discus, made an angry roar. That caused the discus
and sword to be both destroyed. Then the Asuras rejoiced, and the gods
were cast down, as S&uacute;ryaprabha had obtained the victory, and
&#346;ruta&#347;arman was taken prisoner. Then the gods praised and
propitiated &#346;iva, and the husband of Ambik&aacute;, being pleased,
gave this command to the gods&mdash;&ldquo;Ask any boon but that
promised to S&uacute;ryaprabha; who can set aside what has been once
promised at a burnt-sacrifice?&rdquo; The gods said&mdash;&ldquo;But,
Lord, let that also which we promised to &#346;ruta&#347;arman be
fulfilled, and let not our sons perish.&rdquo; Then they ceased, and
the Holy Lord thus commanded them, &ldquo;When peace is made, let that
be so, and this is the condition of peace;&mdash;&mdash;let
&#346;ruta&#347;arman with all his retinue do homage to
S&uacute;ryaprabha. Then we will issue a decree which shall be for the
weal of both.&rdquo; The gods acquiesced in this decision of
&#346;iva&rsquo;s, and made &#346;ruta&#347;arman do homage to
S&uacute;ryaprabha. Then they renounced their enmity and embraced one
another, and the gods and Asuras also laid aside their enmity and made
peace with one another. Then, in the hearing of the gods and Asuras,
the holy &#346;iva said this to S&uacute;ryaprabha: &ldquo;You must
rule yourself in the southern half-<i>vedi</i>, but the northern
half-<i>vedi</i> give to &#346;ruta&#347;arman. For you are destined,
my son, soon to receive the fourfold sovereignty of all the sky-goers,
Kinnaras and all. And when you receive this, as you will be in a
distinguished position, you must also give the southern
half-<i>vedi</i> to &#346;r&iacute;kunjarakum&aacute;ra.&rdquo; And as
for the heroes slain on both sides in the battle, let them all rise up
alive with unwounded limbs. After saying this, &#346;iva disappeared,
and all those heroes, who were slain in that battle, rose up unwounded,
as if they had awaked from sleep.</p>
<p>Then S&uacute;ryaprabha, the tamer of his foes, intent on observing
the command of &#346;iva, went to a remote extensive plain, and sitting
in full court, himself made &#346;ruta&#347;arman, who came to him, sit
down on half of his throne. And his companions, headed by
Prabh&aacute;sa, and &#346;ruta&#347;arman&rsquo;s companions, headed
by D&aacute;modara, sat at the side of the two princes. And
Sun&iacute;tha and Maya, and the other D&aacute;navas, and the kings of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas too sat on seats in order of precedence. Then
the Daityas, who were kings of the seven P&aacute;t&aacute;las, headed
by Prahl&aacute;da, and the kings of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb477" href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span>D&aacute;navas came
there out of joy. And Indra came with the Lokap&aacute;las, preceded by
V&#7771;ihaspati, and the Vidy&aacute;dhara Sumeru with
Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra. And all the wives of Ka&#347;yapa came,
headed by Danu, and the wives of S&uacute;ryaprabha in the chariot
Bh&uacute;t&aacute;sana. When they had all sat down, after shewing one
another affection, and going through the prescribed courtesies, a
friend of Danu&rsquo;s, named Siddhi, spoke to them as from her:
&ldquo;O gods and Asuras, the goddess Danu says this to
you&mdash;&lsquo;Say, if you have ever felt before the joy and
satisfaction which we all feel in this friendly meeting! so you ought
not to wage against one another war, which is terrible on account of
the sorrow it produces. Hira&#7751;y&aacute;ksha and those other elder
Asuras, who waged it to obtain the empire of heaven, have passed away,
and Indra is now the eldest, so what cause is there for enmity?</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd27e10546" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;</span>So let your mutual
antagonism drop, and be happy, in order that I may be pleased, and the
prosperity of the worlds may be ensured.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When they
had heard this address of the revered Danu, uttered by the mouth of
Siddhi, V&#7771;ihaspati, Indra having looked him in the face, said to
her&mdash;&ldquo;The gods entertain no design against the Asuras, and
are willing to be friends with them, unless they display a treacherous
animosity against the gods.&rdquo; When the preceptor of the gods said
this, Maya the king of the D&aacute;navas said&mdash;&ldquo;If the
Asuras entertained any animosity, how could Namuchi have given to Indra
the horse Uchchhaih&#803;&#347;ravas that resuscitates the dead? And
how could Prabala have given his own body to the gods? And how could
Bali have given the three worlds to Vish&#7751;u, and himself have gone
to prison? Or how could Ayodeha have given his own body to
Vi&#347;vakarman? What more shall I say? The Asuras are ever generous,
and if they are not treacherously injured, they cherish no
animosity.&rdquo; When the Asura Maya had said this, Siddhi made a
speech, which induced the gods and Asuras to make peace and embrace one
another.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a female warder, named Jay&aacute;, sent by
Bhav&aacute;n&iacute;, came there and was honoured by all, and she said
to Sumeru, &ldquo;I am sent by the goddess Durg&aacute; to you, and she
gives you this order&mdash;&lsquo;You have an unmarried daughter named
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10551" title=
"Source: K&aacute;machu&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i">K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i</span>;
give her quickly to S&uacute;ryaprabha, for she is a votary of
mine.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When Jay&aacute; said this to Sumeru, he
bowed, and answered her&mdash;&ldquo;I will do as the goddess
Durg&aacute; commands me, for this is a great favour to me, and this
very thing was long ago enjoined on me by the god &#346;iva.&rdquo;
When Sumeru answered Jay&aacute; on this wise, she said to
S&uacute;ryaprabha&mdash;&ldquo;You must set <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e10554" title=
"Source: K&aacute;machu&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i">K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i</span>
above all your wives, and she must be respected by you more than all
the others; this is the order given to you to-day by the goddess
Gaur&iacute;, being propitious to you.&rdquo; When Jay&aacute; had said
this, she disappeared, after having been honoured by
S&uacute;ryaprabha. And Sumeru quickly fixed upon an auspicious moment
in that same day for the marriage, and he had an altar made there, with
pillars and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>pavement of refulgent jewels, furnished with
fire that seemed, as it were, eclipsed by their rays. And he summoned
there his daughter K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i,
whose beauty was greedily drunk in by the eager eyes of gods and
Asuras. Her loveliness was like that of Um&aacute;, and no wonder, for
if P&aacute;rvat&iacute; was the daughter of Him&aacute;laya, she was
the daughter of Sumeru. Then he made her ascend the altar, fully
adorned, resplendent from the ceremony of the marriage-thread, and then
S&uacute;ryaprabha took the lotus-hand of
K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i, on which bracelets had
been fastened by Danu, and the other ladies. And when the first handful
of parched grain<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10559src" href=
"#xd27e10559" name="xd27e10559src">10</a> was thrown into the fire,
Jay&aacute; immediately came and gave her an imperishable celestial
garland sent by Bhav&aacute;n&iacute;, and then Sumeru bestowed
priceless jewels, and an excellent elephant of heavenly breed,
descended from Air&aacute;vata. And at the second throwing of parched
grain, Jay&aacute;, bestowed a necklace, of such a kind that, as long
as it is upon a person&rsquo;s neck, hunger, thirst and death cannot
harm them; and Sumeru gave twice as many jewels as before, and a
matchless horse descended from <span class="corr" id="xd27e10562"

And at the third throwing of grain, Jay&aacute; gave a single string of
jewels, such that, as long as it is on the neck, youth does not wither,
and Sumeru gave a heap of jewels three times as large as the first, and
gave a heavenly pearl that bestowed all kinds of magic powers upon its
possessor.</p>
<p>Then the wedding being over, Sumeru said to all present;
&ldquo;Gods, Asuras, Vidy&aacute;dharas, mothers of the gods, and all.
To-day all of you must eat in my house, you must do me this honour, I
entreat you with palms folded above my head.&rdquo; They all were
inclined to refuse Sumeru&rsquo;s invitation, but in the meanwhile
Nandin arrived; he said to them, who bowed humbly before him,
&ldquo;&#346;iva commands you to feast in the house of Sumeru, for he
is the god&rsquo;s servant, and if you eat his food, you will be
satisfied for ever.&rdquo; All of them, when they heard this from
Nandin, agreed to it. Then there came there innumerable Ga&#7751;as
sent by &#346;iva, under the leadership of Vin&aacute;yaka,
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, V&iacute;rabhadra and others. They prepared a
place fit for dining, and caused the guests to sit down in order, gods,
Vidy&aacute;dharas and men. And the divine beings V&iacute;rabhadra,
Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, Bh&#7771;ingin and others, ministered to them
viands produced by Sumeru by magic, and others supplied by the cow
K&aacute;madhenu ordered to do so by &#346;iva, and they waited upon
every single guest according to his rank, and then there was a concert,
charming on account of the dancing of heavenly nymphs, and in which the
bards of the Vidy&aacute;dharas kept continually joining out of
delight. And at the end of the feast, Nandin and the others gave them
all celestial garlands, robes, and ornaments. After they had thus
honoured the gods and others, all the chiefs of the Ga&#7751;as, Nandin
and the others, departed with all the Ga&#7751;as as they had come.
Then all the gods and Asuras, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479"
href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>those mothers of theirs, and
&#346;ruta&#347;arman and his followers took leave of Sumeru, and went
each to his own place. But S&uacute;ryaprabha and his wife, accompanied
by all his former wives, went in the chariot first to that ascetic
grove of Sumeru. And he sent his companion Harsha to announce his
success to the kings and to his brother Ratnaprabha. And at the close
of day he entered the private apartments of his wife <span class="corr"

in which were splendid jewelled couches, and which were admirably
built. There he flattered her by saying to her, &ldquo;Now other women
dwell outside of me, but you alone live in my heart.&rdquo; Then the
night and his sleep gradually came to an end.</p>
<p>And in the morning S&uacute;ryaprabha got up, and went and paid
compliments to his head-wives, who were all together. And while they
were rejecting him, as being in love with a new wife, with playfully
sarcastic, sweet, affectionate, and bashful turns of speech, a
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10575" title=
"Source: V&iacute;dy&aacute;dhara">Vidy&aacute;dhara</span> named
Sushena came, announced by the warder, and after doing homage, said to
that triumphant king&mdash;&ldquo;Your highness, I have been sent here
by all the princes of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, the lord of
Trik&uacute;&#7789;a and others, and they make this representation to
your highness&mdash;&lsquo;It is auspicious that your coronation should
take place on the third day at the mountain &#7770;ishabha, let this be
announced to all, and let the necessary preparations be
made.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When S&uacute;ryaprabha heard that, he
answered the ambassador&mdash;&ldquo;Go, and say to the king of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10578" title=
"Source: T&#7771;ik&uacute;&#7789;a">Trik&uacute;&#7789;a</span> and
the other Vidy&aacute;dharas from me&mdash;&lsquo;Let your honours
begin the preparations, and say yourselves what further is to be done;
I for my part am ready. But I will announce the day to all, as is
fitting.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Then Sushena departed, taking with him
this answer. But S&uacute;ryaprabha sent off his friends
Prabh&aacute;sa and the others, one by one, to invite all the gods, and
the hermits, Y&aacute;jnavalkya and others, and the kings, and the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, and the Asuras to the great festival of his
coronation.</p>
<p>He himself went alone to Kail&aacute;sa the monarch of mountains, in
order to invite &#346;iva and Ambik&aacute;. And as he was ascending
that mountain, he saw that it gleamed white as ashes, looking like a
second &#346;iva to be adored by the Siddhas, &#7770;ishis, and gods.
After he had got more than half-way up it, and had seen that further on
it was hard to climb, he beheld on one side a coral door. When he found
that, though gifted with supernatural power, he could not enter, he
praised &#346;iva with intent mind. Then a man with an elephant&rsquo;s
face opened the door, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Come! enter! the holy
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10583" title=
"Source: Gane&#347;a">Ga&#7751;e&#347;a</span> is satisfied with
you.&rdquo; Then S&uacute;ryaprabha entered, inly wondering, and beheld
the god seated on a broad slab of <i>jyot&iacute;rasa</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10589src" href="#xd27e10589" name=
"xd27e10589src">11</a> with one tusk, and an elephant&rsquo;s
proboscis, in brightness like twelve suns, with pendent stomach, with
three eyes, with flaming axe and club, surrounded by many Ga&#7751;as
with the faces of animals, and falling at his feet, he adored him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span>The vanquisher of obstacles, being pleased,
asked him the cause of his coming, and said to him with an affectionate
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Ascend by this path.&rdquo; S&uacute;ryaprabha
ascended by that path another five <i>yojanas</i>, and saw another
great door of ruby. And not being able to enter there either, he
praised the god &#346;iva by his thousand names with intent mind. Then
the son of Skanda, called Vi&#347;&aacute;kha, himself opened the door,
proclaiming who he was, and introduced the prince into the interior.
And S&uacute;ryaprabha, having entered, beheld Skanda of the brightness
of burning fire, accompanied by his five sons like himself,
&#346;&aacute;kha, Vi&#347;&aacute;kha and their brothers, surrounded
by inauspicious planets, and infant planets,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10598src" href="#xd27e10598" name="xd27e10598src">12</a> that
submitted to him as soon as he was born, and by ten millions of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10601" title=
"Source: Gane&#347;as">Ga&#7751;e&#347;as</span>, prostrate at his
feet. That god K&aacute;rtikeya also, being pleased, asked the cause of
his coming, and shewed him the path by which to ascend the mountain. In
the same manner he passed five other jewel-doors in succession, kept by
Bhairava, Mah&aacute;k&aacute;la, V&iacute;rabhadra, Nandin, and
Bh&#7771;ingin severally, each with his attendants, and at last he
reached on the top of the mountain an eighth door of crystal. Then he
praised &#346;iva, and he was introduced courteously by one of the
Rudras, and beheld that abode of &#346;iva that excelled Svarga, in
which blew winds of heavenly fragrance, in which the trees ever bore
fruit and flowers,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10604src" href=
"#xd27e10604" name="xd27e10604src">13</a> in which the Gandharvas had
begun their concert, which was all joyous with the dancing of
Apsarases. Then, in one part of it, S&uacute;ryaprabha beheld with joy
the great god &#346;iva, seated on a throne of crystal, three-eyed,
trident in hand, in hue like unto pure crystal, with yellow matted
locks, with a lovely half-moon for crest, adored by the holy daughter
of the mountain, who was seated at his side. And he advanced, and fell
at the feet of him and the goddess Durg&aacute;. Then the adorable Hara
placed his hand on his back, and made him rise up, and sit down, and
asked him why he had come. And S&uacute;ryaprabha answered the god,
&ldquo;My coronation is nigh at hand, therefore I desire the
Lord&rsquo;s presence at it.&rdquo; Then &#346;iva said to him,
&ldquo;Why have you gone through so much toil and hardship? Why did you
not think of me where you were, in order that I might appear there. Be
it so, I will be present.&rdquo; The god, who is kind to his votaries,
said this, and calling a certain Ga&#7751;a who stood near him, gave
him the following command: &ldquo;Go and take this man to the
&#7770;ishabha mountain, in order that he may be crowned emperor, for
that is the place appointed for the grand coronation of emperors such
as he is.&rdquo; When the Ga&#7751;a had received this command from the
holy god, he took in his lap with all respect S&uacute;ryaprabha, who
had circumambulated &#346;iva. And he carried him and placed him on the
&#7770;ishabha mountain by his magic power that very moment, and then
disappeared. And when S&uacute;ryaprabha arrived there, his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>companions came to him, and his wives with

at their head, and the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, and the gods
with Indra, and the Asuras with Maya at their head, and
&#346;ruta&#347;arman, and Sumeru with Suv&aacute;sakum&aacute;ra. And
S&uacute;ryaprabha honoured them all in becoming fashion, and when he
told the story of his interview with &#346;iva, they congratulated him.
Then Prabh&aacute;sa and the others brought the water of consecration
with their own hands, mixed with various herbs, in pitchers of jewels
and gold, taking it from male and female rivers, seas and holy bathing
places. In the meanwhile the holy &#346;iva came there, accompanied by
Durg&aacute;; and the gods, and Asuras and Vidy&aacute;dharas, and
kings, and great <i>&#7771;ishis</i> adored his foot. And while all the
gods, and D&aacute;navas, and Vidy&aacute;dharas uttered loud cries of
&ldquo;Blessed be this day,&rdquo; the <i>&#7771;ishis</i> made
S&uacute;ryaprabha sit on the throne, and pouring all the waters over
him, declared him emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. And the discreet
Asura Maya joyfully fastened on his turban and diadem. And the drum of
the gods, preceded by the dancing of lovely Apsarases, sounded joyfully
in heaven, in unison with the cymbals of earth. And that assembly of
great <i>&#7771;ishis</i> poured the water of consecration over
K&aacute;mach&uacute;&#7693;&aacute;ma&#7751;i also, and made her the
appropriate queen consort of S&uacute;ryaprabha. Then, the gods and
Asuras having departed, S&uacute;ryaprabha, the emperor of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, protracted his great coronation feast with his
relations, friends, and companions. And in a few days he gave to
&#346;ruta&#347;arman that northern half <i>vedi</i> mentioned by
&#346;iva, and having obtained his other beloved ones, he enjoyed for a
long time, together with his companions, the fortune of king of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus by virtue of the favour of &#346;iva,
S&uacute;ryaprabha, though a man, obtained of yore the empire of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having told this story in the presence of the king of Vatsa, and
having bowed before Narav&aacute;hanadatta, Vajraprabha, the king of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, ascended to heaven. And after he had gone, that
hero, king Narav&aacute;hanadatta, together with his queen
Madanamanchuk&aacute;, remained in the house of his father the king of
Vatsa, waiting to obtain the rank of emperor of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.

<p>Thus Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa, dwelt in
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; in the palace of his father, having heard
with astonishment of the reign of the king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas.
And once on a time, having gone out hunting, he dismissed his army, and
entered a great forest, with Gomukha as his only companion. There the
throbbing of his right eye indicated the approach of good fortune, and
he soon heard the sound of singing mixed with the notes of a heavenly
lyre. After going a short distance to find whence the sound proceeded,
he beheld a Svayambh&uacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10646src" href=
"#xd27e10646" name="xd27e10646src">1</a> temple of &#346;iva, and after
tying up his horse, he entered it. And there he beheld a heavenly
maiden, surrounded by many other lovely maidens, praising &#346;iva
with the harp. As soon as he saw her, with the effluent streams of her
loveliness she disturbed his heart, as the orb of the moon disturbs the
heart of the sea. She too looked on him with impassioned, loving, and
bashful eye, and had her mind solely fixed on him, and forgot to pour
forth her notes. Then Gomukha, who read his master&rsquo;s soul, began
to ask her attendants&mdash;&ldquo;Who is she, and whose daughter is
she?&rdquo; But in the meanwhile a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; of mature
age, resembling her in feature, descended from heaven, preceded by a
gleam red as gold. And she came down, and sat by the side of that
maiden, and then the maiden rose up, and fell at her feet. And that
mature dame blessed that girl, saying, &ldquo;Obtain without impediment
a husband, who shall be king of all the Vidy&aacute;dharas.&rdquo; Then
Narav&aacute;hanadatta came to that gentle-looking
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, and bowed before her, and after she had given
him her blessing, he slowly said to her: &ldquo;Who is this maiden of
thine, mother, tell me?&rdquo; then that Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; said
to him &ldquo;Listen, I will tell you.&rdquo; <span class=

<h3 class="main">Story of Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is on the mountain-heights of the father of
Gaur&iacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10658src" href="#xd27e10658"
name="xd27e10658src">2</a> a city named &#346;r&iacute;sundarapura, and
in it there dwells a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la. That lofty-souled king had a wife
named K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute;, and in course of time a son was
born to the king by her. And, when Um&aacute; announced to his father
in a dream that he should be devoted to religion, he named him
Dharma&#347;&iacute;la. And in course of time that son
Dharma&#347;&iacute;la grew up to be a young man, and the king, having
had him taught the sciences, appointed him Crown-prince. Then
Dharma&#347;&iacute;la, when appointed Crown-prince, being exclusively
devoted to virtue, and self-controlled, delighted the subjects even
more than did his father. Then the queen K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute;,
the consort of king Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la, became pregnant
again, and gave birth to a daughter. Then a heavenly voice proclaimed,
&ldquo;This daughter shall be the wife of the emperor
Narav&aacute;hanadatta.&rdquo; Then her father gave her the name of
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and the girl gradually grew like a digit of
the moon. And in course of time she attained mature youth, and learned
the sciences from her own father, and through devotion to the god
&#346;iva, began to roam from temple to temple of his. In the meanwhile
that brother of hers, Dharma&#347;&iacute;la, who was saintly, though
in the bloom of youth, said in secret to his father
Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la&mdash;&ldquo;My father, these
enjoyments, that vanish in a moment, do not please me; for what is
there in this world which is not distasteful at the last? Have you not
heard on this point the saying of the hermit Vy&aacute;sa? &lsquo;All
aggregations end in dissolution, all erections end in a fall, all
unions end in separation, and life ends in death.&rsquo; So what
pleasure can wise men take in these perishable objects? Moreover,
neither enjoyments nor heaps of wealth accompany one into the other
world, but virtue is the only friend that never moves a step from
one&rsquo;s side. Therefore I will go to the forest, and perform a
severe penance, in order by it to attain everlasting supreme
felicity.&rdquo; When the king&rsquo;s son Dharma&#347;&iacute;la said
this, his father Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la was perturbed, and
answered him with tears in his eyes; &ldquo;My son, what is this sudden
delusion that has overtaken you while still a boy? For good men desire
a life of retirement after they have enjoyed their youth. This is the
time for you to marry a wife, and rule your kingdom justly, and enjoy
pleasures, not to abandon the world.&rdquo; When Dharma&#347;&iacute;la
heard this speech of his father&rsquo;s, he answered: &ldquo;There is
no period for self-control or absence of self-control fixed by age; any
one, even when a child, attains self-control, if favoured by the Lord,
but no bad man attains self-control even when old. And I take no
pleasure in reigning, nor in marrying a wife; the object of my life is
to propitiate &#346;iva by austerities.&rdquo; When the prince said
this, his father Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la, seeing that he could
not be turned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=
"pb485">485</a>]</span>from his purpose even by the greatest efforts,
shed tears, and said; &ldquo;If you, who are young, my son, display
such freedom from passion, why should not I, who am an old man? I too
will go to the forest.&rdquo; He said this, and went to the world of
men, and bestowed on Br&aacute;hmans and the poor a myriad loads of
gold and jewels. And returning to his city, he said to his wife
K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute;: &ldquo;You must, if you wish to obey my
commands, remain here in your own city, and take care of this daughter
of ours, Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and when a year has past, there
will be on this very day an auspicious moment for her marriage. And
then I will give her in marriage to Narav&aacute;hanadatta, and that
son-in-law of mine shall be an emperor, and shall come to this city of
ours.&rdquo; Having said this to his wife, the king made her take an
oath, and then made her return weeping with her daughter, and himself
went with his son to the forest. But his wife
K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; lived in her own city with her daughter;
what virtuous wife would disobey her husband&rsquo;s commands? Then her
daughter Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute; wandered about to many temples
together with her mother, who accompanied her out of affection. And one
day the science named Prajnapti said to her, &ldquo;Go to the holy
places in Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra named Svayambh&uacute;, and there offer
worship, for then you will obtain without difficulty for a husband,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the sole emperor of all the Vidy&aacute;dhara
kings.&rdquo; After hearing this from the science, she went with her
mother to Ka&#347;m&iacute;ra and worshipped &#346;iva in all the holy
places, in Nandikshetra, in Mah&aacute;devagiri, in Amaraparvata, in
the mountains of Sure&#347;var&iacute;, and in Vijaya, and
Kapa&#7789;e&#347;vara. After worshipping the husband of
P&aacute;rvat&iacute; in these and other holy places, that princess of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas and her mother returned home.</p>
<p>Know, auspicious youth, that this is that very maiden
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and that I am her mother
K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute;. And to-day she came to this temple of
&#346;iva without telling me. Then I, perceiving it by the Prajnapti
science, came here, and I was told by the same science that you had
come here also. So marry this daughter of mine who has been ordained
your wife by the god. And to-morrow arrives the day of her marriage
appointed by her father, so return for this day, my son, to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; your own city. And we will go hence, but
to-morrow the king Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la will come from the
grove of asceticism, and himself give you this daughter of his.</p>
<p>When she said this, Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute; and
Narav&aacute;hanadatta were thrown into a strange state of distraction,
for their eyes were full of tears, since their hearts could not bear
that they should be separated from one another even for a night, and
they were like <i>chakrav&aacute;kas</i> when the end of the day is
near. When K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; saw them in such a state, she
said: &ldquo;Why do you show such a want of self-restraint because you
are to be separated for one night. People, who possess firmness, endure
for a long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=

is assigned; hear in proof of this the tale of R&aacute;mabhadra and
S&iacute;t&aacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of R&aacute;ma and S&iacute;t&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago king Da&#347;aratha, the sovereign of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10679" title=
"Source: Ayodhya">Ayodhy&aacute;</span>, had a son, named R&aacute;ma,
the elder brother of Bharata, &#346;atrughna and Lakshma&#7751;a. He
was a partial incarnation of Vish&#7751;u for the overthrow of
R&aacute;va&#7751;a, and he had a wife named S&iacute;t&aacute;, the
daughter of Janaka, the lady of his life. As fate would have it, his
father handed over the kingdom to Bharata, and sent R&aacute;ma to the
forest with S&iacute;t&aacute; and Lakshma&#7751;a. There
R&aacute;va&#7751;a carried off his beloved S&iacute;t&aacute; by
magic, and took her to the city of Lank&aacute;, having slain
Ja&#7789;&aacute;yus on the way. Then R&aacute;ma, in his bereaved
state, made Sugr&iacute;va his friend by killing B&aacute;lin, and by
sending Hanum&aacute;n to Lank&aacute;, obtained news of his wife. And
he crossed the sea by building a bridge over it, and slew
R&aacute;va&#7751;a, and gave the sovereignty of Lank&aacute; to
Vibh&iacute;sha&#7751;a and recovered S&iacute;t&aacute;. Then he
returned from the forest, and while he was ruling his kingdom, that
Bharata had made over to him, S&iacute;t&aacute; became pregnant in
Ayodhy&aacute;. And while the king was roaming through the city at
leisure, with a small retinue, to observe the actions of his subjects,
he beheld a certain man turning his wife, whom he held by the hand, out
of his house, and giving out that her fault was going to the house of
another man.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10682src" href="#xd27e10682"
name="xd27e10682src">3</a> And king R&aacute;ma heard the wife saying
to her husband,&mdash;&ldquo;King R&aacute;ma did not desert his wife,
though she dwelt in the house of the R&aacute;kshasa; this fellow is
superior to him, for he abandons me for going to the house of a
relation.&rdquo; So he went home afflicted; and afraid of the slander
of the people, he abandoned S&iacute;t&aacute; in the forest; a man of
reputation prefers the sorrow of separation to ill-repute. And
S&iacute;t&aacute;, languid with pregnancy, happened to reach the
hermitage of V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, and that <i>&#7771;ishi</i>
comforted her, and made her take up her abode there. And the other
hermits there debated among themselves; &ldquo;Surely this
S&iacute;t&aacute; is guilty, otherwise how could her husband have
deserted her? So, by beholding her, everlasting pollution will attach
to us; but V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki does not expel her from the hermitage
out of pity, and he neutralizes by means of his asceticism the
pollution produced by beholding her, so come, let us go to some other
hermitage.&rdquo; When V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki perceived that, he said;
&ldquo;Br&aacute;hmans, you need not have any misgivings about the
matter, I have perceived her by my meditation to be chaste. When even
then they exhibited incredulity, S&iacute;t&aacute; said to them;
&ldquo;Reverend sirs, test my purity by any means that you know of, and
if I turn out to be unchaste, let me be punished by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>having my head cut off.&rdquo; When the hermits
heard that, they experienced an emotion of pity, and they said to her,
&ldquo;There is a famous bathing-place in this forest, called
&#7788;&iacute;&#7789;hibhasaras, for a certain chaste woman named
&#7788;&iacute;&#7789;hibh&iacute;, being falsely accused by her
husband, who suspected her of familiarity with another man, in her
helplessness invoked the goddess Earth and the Lokap&aacute;las, and
they produced it for her justification. There let the wife of
R&aacute;ma clear herself for our satisfaction.&rdquo; When they said
that, S&iacute;t&aacute; went with them to that lake. And the chaste
woman said&mdash;&ldquo;Mother Earth, if my mind was never fixed even
in a dream on any one besides my husband, may I reach the other side of
the lake,&rdquo;&mdash;and after saying this, she entered the lake, and
the goddess Earth appeared, and, taking her in her lap, carried her to
the other side. Then all the hermits adored that chaste woman, and
enraged at R&aacute;ma&rsquo;s having abandoned her, they desired to
curse him. But S&iacute;t&aacute;, who was devoted to her husband,
dissuaded them, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Do not entertain an inauspicious
thought against my husband, I beg you to curse my wicked self.&rdquo;
The hermits, pleased with that conduct of hers, gave her a blessing
which enabled her to give birth to a son, and she, while dwelling
there, in good time did give birth to a son, and the hermit
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki gave him the name of Lava.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10690src" href="#xd27e10690" name="xd27e10690src">4</a> One day
she took the child and went to bathe, and the hermit, seeing that it
was not in the hut, thought&mdash;&ldquo;She is in the habit, when she
goes to bathe, of leaving her child behind her, so what has become of
the child? Surely it has been carried off by a wild beast. I will
create another, otherwise S&iacute;t&aacute;, on returning from
bathing, will die of grief.&rdquo; Under this impression, the hermit
made a pure babe of <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass, resembling Lava, and placed
him there, and S&iacute;t&aacute; came, and seeing it, said to the
hermit, &ldquo;I have my own boy, so whence came this one,
hermit?&rdquo; When the hermit V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki heard this, he
told her exactly what had taken place, and said, &ldquo;Blameless one,
receive this second son named Ku&#347;a, because I by my power created
him out of <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass.&rdquo; When he said this to her,
S&iacute;t&aacute; brought up those two sons Ku&#347;a and Lava, for
whom V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki performed the sacraments. And those two
young princes of the Kshatriya race, even when children, learned the
use of all heavenly weapons, and all sciences from the hermit
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki.</p>
<p>And one day they killed a deer belonging to the hermitage, and ate
its flesh, and made use of a <i>linga</i>, which V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki
worshipped, as a plaything. The hermit was offended thereby, but at
S&iacute;t&aacute;&rsquo;s intercession he appointed for those youths
the following expiatory penance: &ldquo;Let this Lava go <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>quickly and bring from the lake of Kuvera golden
lotuses, and <i>mand&aacute;ra</i><a class="noteref" id="n488.1src"
href="#n488.1" name="n488.1src">5</a> flowers from his garden, then
worship, both of you brothers, this <i>linga</i> with those flowers; in
this way this crime of those two will be atoned for.&rdquo; When Lava
heard this, he went, though a boy, to Kail&aacute;sa, and invaded that
lake and garden of Kuvera, and after killing the Yakshas, brought back
the lotuses and the flowers, and as he was returning, being tired, he
rested in the way under a tree. And in the meanwhile Lakshma&#7751;a
came that way, seeking a man with auspicious marks for
R&aacute;ma&rsquo;s human sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10737src" href="#xd27e10737" name="xd27e10737src">6</a> He,
according to the custom of Kshatriyas, challenged Lava to fight, and
paralyzed him by the stupefying weapon, and taking him prisoner, led
him to the city of Ayodhy&aacute;. And in the meanwhile
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki comforted S&iacute;t&aacute;, who was anxious
about the return of Lava, and said to Ku&#347;a in his hermitage,
&ldquo;Lakshma&#7751;a has taken prisoner the child Lava and has
carried him off to Ayodhy&aacute;; go and deliver him from
Lakshma&#7751;a, after conquering him with these weapons.&rdquo; When
the sage said this, and gave to Ku&#347;a a heavenly weapon, he went
and with it attacked and besieged the sacrificial enclosure in
Ayodhy&aacute;, and he conquered in fight Lakshma&#7751;a, who advanced
to repel him, by the help of those heavenly weapons; then R&aacute;ma
advanced to meet him; and when he could not, though exerting himself to
the utmost, conquer with weapons that Ku&#347;a, owing to the might of
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, he asked him who he was, and why he came. Then
Ku&#347;a said, &ldquo;Lakshma&#7751;a has taken my elder brother
prisoner and brought him here; I have come here to set him at liberty.
We two are Ku&#347;a and Lava the sons of R&aacute;ma, this is what our
mother, the daughter of Janaka, says.&rdquo; Thereupon he told her
story. Then R&aacute;ma burst into tears, and summoned Lava and
embraced both, saying, &ldquo;I am that same wicked R&aacute;ma.&rdquo;
Then the citizens assembled and praised S&iacute;t&aacute;, beholding
those two heroic youths, and R&aacute;ma recognised them as his sons.
And then he summoned the queen S&iacute;t&aacute; from the hermitage of
V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, and dwelt with her in happiness, transferring to
his sons the burden of the empire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus heroic souls endure separation for so long a time, and
how can you find it difficult to endure it for only one night?&rdquo;
When K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; had said this to her daughter
Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;, who was eager to be married, and to
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, she departed through the air with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span>intention of returning again, and took her
daughter with her: and Narav&aacute;hanadatta, for his part, returned
despondent to Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;.</p>
<p>Then, as he could not sleep at night, Gomukha said to him to amuse
him&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, hear this story of
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa, which I will relate to you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the handsome king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the Dekhan a city named
Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, in it lived a very handsome king, named
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa. Once on a time two discerning Buddhist
hermits came to him, and seeing that that king was very handsome, they
said to him, &ldquo;King, we have travelled through the world, and we
have nowhere seen a man or woman equal to you in beauty, except the
daughter of king R&uacute;padhara and queen Hemalat&aacute;, in the
isle of Muktipura, R&uacute;palat&aacute; by name, and that maiden
alone is a match for you, and you alone are a match for her; if you
were to be united in marriage, it would be well.&rdquo; With these
words of the hermit, which entered by his ears, the arrows of Love
entered also and stuck in his heart. Then king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa, being full of longing, gave this order
to his admirable painter, Kum&aacute;ridatta by name; &ldquo;Take with
you my portrait, accurately painted on canvas, and with these two
mendicants go to the isle of Muktipura, and there shew it by some
artifice to the king <span class="corr" id="xd27e10754" title=
"Source: Rupadhara">R&uacute;padhara</span> and his daughter
R&uacute;palat&aacute;. Find out if that king will give me his daughter
or not, and take a likeness of R&uacute;palat&aacute;, and bring it
back.&rdquo; When the king had said this, he made the painter take his
likeness on canvas, and sent him with the mendicants to that island.
And so the painter and the mendicants set out, and in course of time
reached a city named Putrapura on the shore of the sea. There they
embarked on a ship, and going across the sea, they reached in five days
that island of Muktipura. There the painter went and held up at the
gate of the palace a notice, to the effect that there was no painter
like him in the world. When the king R&uacute;padhara heard of that, he
summoned him, and the painter entered the palace, and bowing, he said:
&ldquo;O king, though I have travelled all over the earth, I have never
seen my match as a painter, so tell me, whom I am to paint of gods,
mortals, and Asuras.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he summoned his
daughter R&uacute;palat&aacute; into his presence, and gave him the
following order: &ldquo;Make a portrait of this daughter of mine, and
shew it me.&rdquo; Then the painter Kum&aacute;ridatta made a portrait
of the princess on canvas and shewed it, and it was exactly like the
original. Then king R&uacute;padhara was pleased, and thinking him
clever, he asked that painter, in his desire to obtain a son-in-law,
&ldquo;My good fellow, you have travelled over the earth: so tell me if
you have anywhere seen a woman or a man equal to my daughter in
beauty.&rdquo; When the king said this, the painter answered him,
&ldquo;I have nowhere in the world seen a woman or a man equal to her,
except a king in Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, named
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa, who is a match for her; if she were
married to him, it would be well. Since he has not found a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name=
"pb490">490</a>]</span>princess equal in beauty, he remains, though in
his fresh youth, without a wife. And I, your majesty, having beheld
that king, dear to the eyes, took a faithful likeness of him, out of
admiration of his beauty.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he said:
&ldquo;Have you that portrait with you?&rdquo; And the painter said,
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; and showed the portrait. Thereupon the king
R&uacute;padhara, beholding the beauty of that king <span class="corr"
id="xd27e10759" title=
"Source: P&#7771;ithv&iacute;dhara">P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa</span>,
found his head whirl round with astonishment. And he said,
&ldquo;Fortunate are we to have beheld that king even in a picture; I
felicitate those who behold him in the flesh. When
R&uacute;palat&aacute; heard this speech of her father&rsquo;s, and saw
the king in the picture, she was full of longing, and could neither
hear nor see anything else. Then the king R&uacute;padhara, seeing that
his daughter was distracted with love, said to that painter
Kum&aacute;ridatta, &ldquo;Your pictures exactly correspond to the
original, so that king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa must be an
appropriate husband for my daughter. So take this portrait of my
daughter, and set off immediately, and shew my daughter to king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa; and tell the whole incident as it took
place, and if he pleases, let him come here quickly, to marry
her.&rdquo; Thus the king spake, and honoured the painter with gifts,
and sent him off with his ambassador, in the company of the
mendicants.</p>
<p>The painter, the ambassador, and the mendicants crossed the sea, and
all reached the court of P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa in
Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na. There they gave the present to that king,
and told him the whole transaction, as it took place, and the message
of R&uacute;padhara. And then that painter Kum&aacute;ridatta shewed to
that king his beloved <span class="corr" id="xd27e10764" title=
"Source: Rupalat&aacute;">R&uacute;palat&aacute;</span> in a painting.
As the king gazed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10767src" href=
"#xd27e10767" name="xd27e10767src">7</a> his eye was drowned in that
sea of beauty her person, so that he could not draw it out again. For
the king, whose longing was excessive, could not be satisfied with
devouring her form, which poured forth a stream of the nectar of
beauty, as the partridge cannot be satisfied with devouring the
moonlight. And he said to the painter, &ldquo;My friend, worthy of
praise is the Creator who made this beauty, and yourself who copied it.
So I accept the proposal of king R&uacute;padhara; I will go to the
island of Muktipura and marry his daughter.&rdquo; After saying this,
the king honoured the painter, the ambassador, and the hermits, and
remained looking at the picture.</p>
<p>And afflicted with the sorrow of absence, the king spent that day in
gardens and other places, and set out the next day on his expedition,
after ascertaining a favourable moment. And the king mounted the great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>elephant Mangalagha&#7789;a, and proceeded on
his way with many horses and elephants, with chiefs and
R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts, and with the painter and the hermits, together
with the ambassador of R&uacute;padhara, and in a few days he reached
the entrance of the Vindhya forest, and encamped there in the evening.
The next day, the king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa mounted an
elephant named &#346;atrumardana, and going on entered that forest. And
as he was slowly proceeding, he beheld his army, which was marching in
front of him, suddenly fleeing. And while he was perplexed as to what
it could mean, a R&aacute;jp&uacute;t named Nirbhaya, mounted on an
elephant, came up and said to him, &ldquo;King, a very large army of
Bhillas attacked us in front there; in the fight that ensued those
Bhillas slew with their arrows just fifty of our elephants, and a
thousand of our footmen, and three hundred horses; but our troops laid
low two thousand Bhillas, so that for every single corpse seen in our
host two were seen in theirs. Then our forces were routed, galled with
their arrows, which resemble thunderbolts.&rdquo; When the king heard
that, he was angry, and advancing he slew the army of the Bhillas, as
Arjuna slew that of the Kauravas. Then the other bandits were slain by
Nirbhaya and his comrades,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10785src" href=
"#xd27e10785" name="xd27e10785src">8</a> and the king cut off with one
crescent-headed arrow the head of the commander of the Bhillas. The
king&rsquo;s elephant &#346;atrumardana, with the blood flowing from
arrow-wounds, resembled a mountain of collyrium pouring forth streams
coloured with cinnabar. Then his whole army, that had been dispersed,
returned, finding themselves victorious, and those Bhillas, that had
escaped slaughter, fled in all directions. And the king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa, having brought the fight to an end,
had his might extolled by the ambassador of R&uacute;padhara, and being
victorious, encamped in that very forest district, on the bank of a
lake, to recruit the strength of his wounded troops.</p>
<p>And in the morning the king set out thence, and slowly advancing he
reached that city of Putrapura on the shore of the sea. There he rested
for a day, being entertained in becoming fashion by the king of that
place, named Ud&aacute;racharita. And he crossed the sea in ships
supplied by him, and in eight days reached the isle of Muktipura.</p>
<p>And the king R&uacute;padhara, hearing of it, came to meet him
delighted, and the two kings met and embraced one another. Then the
king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa entered his city with him, being,
so to speak, drunk in by the eyes of the ladies of the city. Then the
queen Hemalat&aacute; and the king R&uacute;padhara, seeing that he was
a suitable husband for their daughter, rejoiced. And that king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa remained there, and R&uacute;padhara
honoured him with entertainment in accordance with his own
magnificence.</p>
<p>And the next day, the long-desiring R&uacute;palat&aacute; ascended
the altar in an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492"
name="pb492">492</a>]</span>auspicious moment, and he with exultation
received her hand in marriage. And when they beheld one another&rsquo;s
beauty, the expanded eye of each was extended to the ear, as if to
inform that organ that the report it had heard before was true. When
the parched grain was thrown, R&uacute;padhara gave jewels in such
abundance to the happy couple, that men thought he was a perfect mine
of jewels. And after his daughter&rsquo;s marriage had taken place, he
honoured the painter and the two mendicants with dresses and ornaments,
and bestowed gifts on all the others. Then that king
P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa, remaining in that city with his
attendants, enjoyed the best meat and drink the isle could produce. The
day was spent in singing and dancing, and at night the eager king
entered the private apartments of R&uacute;palat&aacute;, in which
jewelled couches were spread, which was adorned with jewelled pavement,
the circuit of which was propped on jewelled pillars, and which was lit
up with jewel-lamps. And in the morning he was woke up by the bards and
heralds reciting, and he rose up and remained as the moon in
heaven.</p>
<p>Thus king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa remained ten days in that
island, amusing himself with ever-fresh enjoyments furnished by his
father-in-law. On the eleventh day, the king, with the consent of the
astrologers, set out with R&uacute;palat&aacute;, after the auspicious
ceremony had been performed for him. And he was escorted by his
father-in-law as far as the shore of the sea, and accompanied by his
retainers, he embarked on the ships with his wife. He crossed the sea
in eight days, and his army, that was encamped on the shore, joined
him, and the king Ud&aacute;racharita came to meet him, and then he
went to Putrapura. There king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa rested
some days, and was entertained by that king, and then he set out from
that place. And he mounted his beloved R&uacute;palat&aacute; on the
elephant Jayamangala, and he himself mounted an elephant named
Kaly&aacute;&#7751;agiri. And the king, proceeding by continual stages,
in due course reached his good city of Pratish&#7789;h&aacute;na, where
flags and banners were waving. Then, after beholding
R&uacute;palat&aacute;, the ladies of the city lost at once all pride
in their own beauty, and gazed on her with eyes unwinking from wonder.
Then king P&#7771;ithv&iacute;r&uacute;pa entered his palace, making
high festival, and he gave to that painter villages and wealth, and he
honoured those two hermits with wealth as they deserved, and gave
complimentary presents to the chiefs, ministers and
R&aacute;jp&uacute;ts. Then that king, having attained his object,
enjoyed there this world&rsquo;s happiness in the society of
R&uacute;palat&aacute;.</p>
<p>After the minister Gomukha had told Narav&aacute;hanadatta this tale
with the object of amusing him, he went on to say to the impatient
prince,&mdash;&ldquo;Thus the resolute endure painful separation for a
long time, but how is it that you cannot endure it even for one night,
O king? For to-morrow your Highness shall marry
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;.&rdquo; When Gomukha had said this,
Marubh&uacute;ti the son of Yaugandhar&aacute;ya&#7751;a came up at
that instant, and said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href=
"#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span>&ldquo;What stuff will you not
prate, being ungalled, and never having felt the agony of love? A man
possesses firmness and discernment and morality, only so long as he
does not come within the range of the arrows of Love. Happy in the
world are Sarasvat&iacute;, Skanda, and Buddha, these three, who have
brushed off and flung away love, like a blade of grass clinging to the
skirt of the robe.&rdquo; When Marubh&uacute;ti said this,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, perceiving that Gomukha was distressed, said in
order to comfort him,&mdash;&ldquo;What Gomukha said to me was
appropriate, and it was said to amuse me, for what loving friend exults
over one in the agony of separation? One afflicted by the pain of
separation should be comforted by his friends to the best of their
ability, and the sequel should be left to the disposal of the
five-arrowed god.&rdquo; Talking in this style, and hearing various
tales from his attendants, Narav&aacute;hanadatta somehow managed to
get through that night. And when morning came, he rose up and performed
his necessary duties, and saw K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; descending
from heaven, accompanied by her husband
Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la, and her son Dharma&#347;&iacute;la,
and that Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute; her daughter; and they all
descended from the chariot and came near him, and he welcomed them as
was fitting, and they saluted him in like manner. And in the meanwhile
thousands of other Vidy&aacute;dharas descended from heaven, carrying
loads of gold, jewels, and other valuables; and after hearing of this
occurrence, the king of Vatsa came there with his ministers and his
queens, delighted at the advancement of his son. After the king of
Vatsa had performed the rites of hospitality duly, the king
Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la said to him, bowing
graciously,&mdash;&ldquo;King, this is my daughter
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and when she was born, she was declared by
a voice, that came from heaven, to be destined to be the wife of this
thy son Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the future emperor of all the
Vidy&aacute;dhara kings. So I will give her to him, for this is a
favourable moment for them; for this reason I have come here with all
these.&rdquo; The king of Vatsa welcomed that speech of the
Vidy&aacute;dhara sovereign&rsquo;s, saying, &ldquo;It is a great
favour that you do me.&rdquo; Then the ruler of the Vidy&aacute;dharas
sprinkled with water, produced in the hollow of his hand by virtue of
his science, the ground of the courtyard. Immediately there was
produced there an altar of gold, covered with a heavenly cloth, and a
pavilion, not made with hands, for the preliminary ceremony, composed
of various jewels. Then the successful king
Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la said to
Narav&aacute;hanadatta&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, the favourable moment has
arrived&mdash;bathe.&rdquo; After he had bathed, and had the
marriage-thread put on, the king Alank&aacute;ra&#347;&iacute;la, being
delighted, gave him with all his heart his daughter, after bringing her
to the altar in her bridal dress. And when the grain was thrown into
the fire, he and his son gave to his daughter thousands of loads of
jewels, gold, garments and ornaments, and heavenly nymphs. And after
the marriage was over, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href=
"#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>honoured them all, and then took
his leave of them, and with his wife and son departed, as he came,
through the air. Then the king of Vatsa, seeing his son destined to
advancement, being honoured by the bending kings of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, was delighted, and prolonged that feast to a great
length. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having obtained
Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;, charming on account of her good
conduct, and of noble virtues, like a skilful poet who has obtained a
style, charming on account of its excellent metre, and of splendid
merits, remained delighted with her.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Then Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of
Vatsa, being united to Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute; his new wife,
remained in the house of his father, pleased with the heavenly dancing
and singing of her maids, and enjoying banquets with his ministers.</p>
<p>And one day his mother-in-law K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute;, the
mother of Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;, came to him and said, after
he had hospitably entertained her&mdash;&ldquo;Come to our palace,
behold that city of Sundarapura, and take your delight in its gardens
with Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;.&rdquo; When he heard this, he
consented, and he informed his father, and by his advice took Vasantaka
with him, and with his wife and his minister, he ascended a splendid
chariot created by his mother-in-law by her science, and set out
through the air, and while in the chariot, he looked down from heaven,
and beheld the earth of the size of a mound, and the seas small as
ditches, and in due course he reached the Him&aacute;layas with his
mother-in-law, wife, and attendants, and it resounded with the songs of
the Kinnar&iacute;s, and was adorned with the companies of heavenly
nymphs. There he saw a great many wonderful sights, and then he reached
the city of Sundarapura. It was adorned with many palaces of gold and
jewels, and, thus, though it was on the Him&aacute;layas, it made the
beholder suppose that he was looking on the peaks of mount
Meru.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10823src" href="#xd27e10823" name=
"xd27e10823src">1</a> And he descended from the heaven, and getting out
of the carriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495"
name="pb495">495</a>]</span>entered that city, which, as it were,
danced with the waving silk of its banners, in its joy at having once
more a king. And he entered that palace, with the auspicious ceremony
performed for him by his mother-in-law, accompanied by
Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and with his favourites and
Vasantaka. There the fortunate prince spent the day in his
father-in-law&rsquo;s palace, in enjoyments which were provided for him
by the power of his mother-in-law. And on the next day his
mother-in-law K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; said to him; &ldquo;There is
in this city an image of the holy self-existent husband of
Um&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10847src" href="#xd27e10847"
name="xd27e10847src">2</a> He, if visited and worshipped, gives
enjoyment and even salvation. Around it the father of
Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute; made a great garden, and brought down
to it a holy water, rightly named the Ganges-pool: go there to-day to
worship the god and to amuse yourselves.&rdquo; When his mother-in-law
said this to him, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, accompanied by his wife
Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;, and followed by his attendants, went
to that garden of &#346;iva. It looked lovely with its golden-trunked
trees, which were charming with their branches of jewels, the clear
white flowers of which were clusters of pearls, and the shoots of which
were coral.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10852src" href="#xd27e10852"
name="xd27e10852src">3</a> There he bathed in the Ganges-pool and
worshipped &#346;iva, and wandered round the tanks that were adorned
with ladders of jewels and lotuses of gold. And, accompanied by his
attendants, he amused himself with Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute; on
their charming banks, and in bowers of the wish-granting creeper. And
in those he delighted his soul with heavenly banquets and concerts, and
amusing jokes caused by the simplicity of <span class="corr" id=

Narav&aacute;hanadatta dwelt a month there, amusing himself in gardens,
thanks to the resources of his mother-in-law. Then that
K&aacute;nchanaprabh&aacute; bestowed on him, his wife, and his
ministers, garments and ornaments fit for gods, and with his
mother-in-law and his attendants, he returned in that same chariot to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, accompanied by his wife, and he gladdened
the eyes of his parents.</p>
<p>There Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute; was thus addressed by her
mother in the presence of the king of Vatsa; &ldquo;You must never by
jealous anger make your husband unhappy, for the fruit of that fault,
my daughter, is separation that causes great affliction. Because I was
jealous in old time and afflicted my husband, I am now consumed with
remorse, as he has gone to the forest.&rdquo; After saying this, she
embraced her daughter with eyes blinded with tears, and flying up into
the air went to her own city.</p>
<p>Then, that day having come to an end, the next morning
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, having performed the appropriate duties, was
sitting with his ministers, when a woman rushed into the presence of
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10865" title=

and said&mdash;&ldquo;Queen, I am a woman in the utmost terror, protect

to implore protection.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496"
href="#pb496" name="pb496">496</a>]</span>The queen said, &ldquo;Do not

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My sovereign, I am the daughter of a Kshatriya in this
city, named Balasena, and my name is A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;. When
I was a virgin, I was demanded from my father by a rich Br&aacute;hman
named Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman, who was captivated by my beauty. And I
said to my father; &ldquo;I do not like this ugly grim-visaged man for
a husband; if you give me to him, I will not remain in his
house.&rdquo; Though Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman heard that, he sat in
<i>dharna</i> at the door of my father&rsquo;s house, until he gave me
to him, being afraid of causing the death of a Br&aacute;hman. Then the
Br&aacute;hman married me and carried me off reluctant, and I deserted
him, and fled to another man, the son of a Kshatriya. But that
Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman managed to crush him by the power of his wealth,
and then I went to another Kshatriya, who was well off. Then this
Br&aacute;hman went at night and set his house on fire. Then he
abandoned me, and I went to a third Kshatriya, and this Br&aacute;hman
burnt his house also at night. Then I was abandoned by him also, and I
became a fugitive, flying in terror, as the sheep flies from the
jackal, from that Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman, who wishes to slay me, and
follows me step by step. In this very city I entered the service of the
mighty V&iacute;ra&#347;arman your servant, a <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e10878" title="Source: R&aacute;jput">R&aacute;jp&uacute;t</span>
who protects the helpless. When the wicked Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman found
that out, he was miserable at having no hope of recovering me, and
being afflicted with separation, he was reduced to skin and bone. But
the <span class="corr" id="xd27e10881" title=
"Source: R&aacute;jput">R&aacute;jp&uacute;t</span>
V&iacute;ra&#347;arman, when disposed to imprison him for my
protection, was prevented by me, O queen. To-day it chanced that I went
outside the house, and Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman, seeing me, drew his
sword and rushed on me to kill me, but I thereupon fled here, and the
female warder, melted with compassion, opened the door and let me
enter, but he, I know, is waiting for me outside.</p>
<p>When she said this, the king had the Br&aacute;hman
Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman summoned into his presence; he looked at
A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute; with an eye inflamed with anger, his form
was distorted, he held a sword in his hand, and the joints of his limbs
trembled with rage. The king said to him, &ldquo;Wicked Br&aacute;hman,
do you try to kill a woman, and for her sake set on fire your
neighbours&rsquo; houses? Why are you so wicked?&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman heard that, he said, &ldquo;She is my lawful wife. She
has left my protection and gone elsewhere, how could I endure
that?&rdquo; When he said this, A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;, in
distress, exclaimed, &ldquo;O guardians of the world, tell me this; did
he not in your presence marry me and carry me off by force against my
own will? And did I not say at the time, &lsquo;I will not dwell in his
house?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When she said this, a heavenly voice said,
&ldquo;The statement of A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute; is true. But she
is not a woman; hear the truth about her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb497" href="#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span>There is a heroic
king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas named A&#347;okakara. He had no sons,
and once on a time it happened that a daughter was born to him, and she
grew up in the house of her father, under the name of <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e10888" title=
"Source: A&#347;okam&aacute;la">A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;</span>.
And when she arrived at an adult age, and he, desiring to perpetuate
his race, offered her in marriage, she would not take any husband,
through exceeding pride in her own beauty. For that reason her father,
vexed with her obstinacy, denounced this curse on her; &lsquo;Become a
mortal, and in that state thou shalt have the same name. And an ugly
Br&aacute;hman shall marry thee by force; thou shalt abandon him, and
in thy fear resort to three husbands in succession. Even then he shall
persecute thee, and thou shalt take refuge with a mighty Kshatriya as
his slave, but even then the Br&aacute;hman shall not desist from
persecuting thee. And he shall see thee, and run after thee, with the
object of killing thee, but thou shalt escape, and entering the
king&rsquo;s palace, shalt be delivered from this curse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly that very Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;,
A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;, who was in old time cursed by her father,
has now been born as a woman under the same name. And this appointed
end of her curse has now arrived. She shall now repair to her
Vidy&aacute;dhara home, and enter her own body which is there. There
she, remembering her curse, shall live happily with a Vidy&aacute;dhara
prince, named Abhiruchita, who shall become her husband.&rdquo; When
the heavenly voice had said this, it ceased, and immediately that
A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute; fell dead on the ground. But the king and
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10893" title=
"Source: Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;">Alan&#775;k&aacute;ravat&iacute;</span>,
when they saw that, had their eyes suffused with tears, and so had
their courtiers. But in Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman grief overpowered anger,
and he wept, blinded with passion. Then his eyes suddenly became
expanded with joy. All of them thereupon said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;What
does this mean?&rdquo; Then that Br&aacute;hman said, &ldquo;I remember
my former birth, and I will give an account of it, listen.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the Him&aacute;layas there is a splendid city,
named Madanapura; in it dwelt a Vidy&aacute;dhara prince, named
Pralambabhuja. He had born to him, my lord, a son named
Sth&uacute;labhuja, and he in course of time became a handsome prince
in the flower of youth. Then a king of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, named
Surabhivatsa, came with his daughter to the palace of that king
Pralambabhuja, and said to him: &ldquo;I give this daughter of mine,
called Surabhidatt&aacute;, to your son Sth&uacute;labhuja; let the
accomplished youth marry her now.&rdquo; When Pralambabhuja heard this,
he approved it, and summoning his son, he communicated the matter to
him. Then his son Sth&uacute;labhuja, out of pride in his beauty, said
to him, &ldquo;I will not marry her, my father, for she is not a
first-class beauty.&rdquo; His father thereupon said to him,
&ldquo;What does her plainness matter? For she is of high lineage and
must be honoured on that account, and her father offered her to me for
you, and I have accepted her, so do not refuse.&rdquo; Although
Sth&uacute;labhuja <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498"
name="pb498">498</a>]</span>was thus entreated a second time by his
father, he would not consent to marry her. Then his father, in his
anger, denounced against him the following curse&mdash;&ldquo;On
account of this your pride in your good looks, be born as a man, and in
that state you shall be ugly and with a large mouth. And you shall
acquire by force a wife named A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;, also fallen
by a curse, and she, not liking you, shall leave you, and you shall
experience the grief of separation. And as she shall be attached to
another, you shall commit for her sake arson and other crimes, being
maddened with passion and emaciated with grief.&rdquo; When
Pralambabhuja had uttered this curse, that virtuous Surabhidatt&aacute;
clung to his feet, weeping, and entreated him, &ldquo;Pronounce a curse
on me also, let our lot be the same, let not my husband alone suffer
calamity owing to my fault.&rdquo; When she said this, Pralambabhuja
was pleased, and, in order to comfort that virtuous woman, he appointed
for her this end to his son&rsquo;s curse: &ldquo;Whenever
A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute; shall be released from her curse, then he
shall remember his birth and be released from this curse, and he shall
regain his own body, and remembering his curse, he shall be free from
pride, and soon marry you; then he shall live with you in
happiness.&rdquo; When the virtuous woman was thus addressed by him,
she managed to recover her self-composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know that I am that very Sth&uacute;labhuja, fallen here by a
curse, and I have experienced this great grief owing to the fault of
pride. How can proud men have happiness in a previous or in a present
state of existence? And that curse of mine is now at an end.&rdquo;
After saying this, Ha&#7789;ha&#347;arman abandoned that body, and
became a Vidy&aacute;dhara youth. And he took by the might of his
science the body of A&#347;okam&aacute;l&aacute;, and flung it, without
its being seen, into the Ganges, out of compassion. And he sprinkled
immediately the chamber of <span class="corr" id="xd27e10905" title=

all round with water of the Ganges, brought by the might of his
science, and after bending before Narav&aacute;hanadatta, his future
lord, he flew up into the heaven to his destined prosperity.</p>

named Mah&aacute;var&aacute;ha, the destroyer of his foes. That king
had a daughter named Anangarati, born to him by his wife Padmarati,
owing to his having propitiated Gaur&iacute;, and he had no other
children. And in course of time she attained womanhood, and proud of
her beauty, she did not wish to have any husband, though kings asked

door-keeper&mdash;&ldquo;Take all these now and make them rest in your
house.&rdquo; The door-keeper, when he heard the order, took them to
his house. Then the king said to his daughter Anangarati, &ldquo;My
daughter, which of these four heroes do you prefer?&rdquo; When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>Anangarati heard that, she said to her father;
&ldquo;Father, I do not like any one of the four; the first is a
&#346;&uacute;dra and a weaver, what is the use of his good qualities?
The second is a Vai&#347;ya, and what is the use of his knowing the
language of cattle, and so on? How can I give myself to them, when I am
a Kshatriya woman? The third indeed is a meritorious Kshatriya, equal
to me in birth, but be is a poor man and lives by service, selling his
life. As I am the daughter of a king, how can I become his wife? The
fourth, the Br&aacute;hman J&iacute;vadatta, I do not like; he is ugly
and is addicted to unlawful arts, and, as he has deserted the Vedas, he
has fallen from his high position. You ought to punish him, why do you
offer to give me to him? For you, my father, being a king, are the
upholder of the castes and the various stages of life. And a king, who
is a hero in upholding religion, is preferred to a king, who is only a
hero with the sword. A hero in religion will be the lord of a thousand
heroes with the sword.&rdquo; When his daughter had said this, the king
dismissed her to her own private apartments, and rose up to bathe and
perform his other duties.</p>
<p>And the next day, the four heroes went out from the house of the
door-keeper, and roamed about in the town out of curiosity. And at that
very time a vicious elephant, named Padmakabala, broke his fastening,
and in his fury rushed out from the elephant-stable, trampling down the
citizens. And that great elephant, when he saw the four heroes, rushed
towards them to slay them, and they too advanced towards him with
uplifted weapons. Then the one Kshatriya among them, named
Kha&#7693;gadhara, putting aside the other three, alone attacked that
elephant. And he cut off with one blow the protended trunk of that
roaring elephant, with as much ease as if it had been a lotus-stalk.
And after showing his agility by escaping between his feet, he
delivered a second blow on the back of that elephant. And with the
third he cut off both his feet. Then that elephant gave a groan and
fell down and died. All the people were astonished when they beheld
that valour of his, and king Mah&aacute;var&aacute;ha was also amazed
when he heard of it.</p>
<p>The next day, the king went out to hunt, mounted on an elephant, and
the four heroes, with Kha&#7693;gadhara at their head, accompanied him.
There the king with his army slew tigers, deer, and boars, and the
lions rushed out upon him in anger, hearing the trumpeting of the
elephants. Then that Kha&#7693;gadhara cleft in twain, with one blow of
his sharp sword, the first lion that attacked them, and the second he
seized with his left hand by the foot, and dashing it on the earth,
deprived it of life. And in the same way Bh&aacute;sh&aacute;jna, and
J&iacute;vadatta, and Panchaphu&#7789;&#7789;ika, each dashed a lion to
pieces on the earth. Thus in turn those heroes killed on foot many
tigers, and lions, and other animals, with ease, before the eyes of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501</a>]</span>king. Then that king, being pleased and
astonished, after he had finished his hunting, entered his city, and
those heroes went to the house of the door-keeper. And the king entered
the harem, and though tired, had his daughter Anangarati quickly
summoned. And after describing the valour of those heroes, one by one,
as he had seen it in the chase, he said to her who was much
astonished&mdash;&ldquo;Even if Panchaphu&#7789;&#7789;ika and
Bh&aacute;sh&aacute;jna are of inferior caste, and J&iacute;vadatta,
though a Br&aacute;hman, is ugly and addicted to forbidden practices,
what fault is there in the Kshatriya Kha&#7693;gadhara, who is
handsome, and of noble stature, and is distinguished for strength and
valour; who slew such an elephant, and who takes lions by the foot and
crushes them on the ground, and slays others with the sword? And if it
is made a ground of reproach against him that he is poor and a servant,
I will immediately make him a lord to be served by others: so choose
him for a husband, if you please, my daughter.&rdquo; When Anangarati
heard this from her father, she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Well then,
bring all those men here, and ask the astrologer, and let us see what
he says.&rdquo; When she said this to him, the king summoned those
heroes, and in their presence he, accompanied by his wives, said to the
astrologer with his own mouth: &ldquo;Find out with which of these
Anangarati has conformity of horoscope, and when a favourable moment
will arrive for her marriage.&rdquo; When the skilful astrologer heard
that, he asked the stars under which they were born, and after long
considering the time, he said to that king&mdash;&ldquo;If you will not
be angry with me, king, I will tell you plainly. Your daughter has no
conformity of lot with any one of them. And she will not be married on
earth, for she is a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; fallen by a curse; that
curse of hers will be at an end in three months. So let these wait here
three months, and if she is not gone to her own world then, the
marriage shall take place.&rdquo; All those heroes accepted the advice
of that astrologer, and remained there for three months.</p>
<p>When three months had passed, the king summoned into his presence
those heroes, and that astrologer, and Anangarati. And the king, when
he saw that his daughter had suddenly become exceedingly beautiful,
rejoiced, but the astrologer thought that the hour of her death had
arrived. And while the king was saying to the
astrologer&mdash;&ldquo;Now tell me what it is proper to do, for those
three months are gone,&rdquo; Anangarati called to mind her former
birth, and covering her face with her garment, she abandoned that human
body. The king thought&mdash;&ldquo;Why has she put herself in this
position?&rdquo; But when he himself uncovered her face, he saw that
she was dead, like a frost-smitten lotus-plant, for her eyes like bees
had ceased to revolve, the lotus-flower of her face was pale, and the
sweet sound of her voice had ceased, even as the sound of the swans
departs. Then the king suddenly fell to earth motionless, smitten by
the thunderbolt of grief for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href=
"#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>her, crushed by the extinction of
his race.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10973src" href="#xd27e10973" name=
"xd27e10973src">7</a> And the queen Padmarati also fell down to the
earth in a swoon, and with her ornaments fallen from her like flowers,
appeared like a cluster of blossoms broken by an elephant.</p>
<p>The attendants raised cries of lamentation, and those heroes were
full of grief, but the king, immediately recovering consciousness, said
to that J&iacute;vadatta, &ldquo;In this matter those others have no
power, but now it is your opportunity; you boasted that you could raise
to life a dead woman; if you possess power by means of science, then
recall my daughter to life; I will give her, when restored to life, to
you as being a Br&aacute;hman.&rdquo; When J&iacute;vadatta heard this
speech of the king&rsquo;s, he sprinkled that princess with water, over
which charms had been said, and chanted this &Aacute;ry&aacute; verse:
&ldquo;O thou of the loud laugh, adorned with a garland of skulls, not
to be gazed on, Ch&aacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;, the terrible
goddess, assist me quickly.&rdquo; When, in spite of this effort of
J&iacute;vadatta&rsquo;s, that maiden was not restored to life, he was
despondent, and said&mdash;&ldquo;My science, though bestowed by the
goddess that dwells in the Vindhya range, has proved fruitless, so what
is the use to me of my life that has become an object of scorn?&rdquo;
When he had said this, he was preparing to cut off his head with a
great sword, when a voice came from the sky&mdash;&ldquo;O
J&iacute;vadatta, do not act rashly, listen now. This noble
<span class="corr" id="xd27e10978" title=
"Source: Vidhy&aacute;dhara">Vidy&aacute;dhara</span> maiden, named
Anangaprabh&aacute;, has been for so long a time a mortal owing to the
curse of her parents. She has now quitted this human body, and has gone
to her own world, and taken her own body. So go and propitiate again
the goddess that dwells in the Vindhya hills, and by her favour you
shall recover this noble Vidy&aacute;dhara maiden. But as she is
enjoying heavenly bliss, neither you nor the king ought to mourn for
her.&rdquo; When the heavenly voice had told this true tale, it ceased.
Then the king performed his daughter&rsquo;s rites, and he and his wife
ceased to mourn for her, and those other three heroes returned as they
had come.</p>
<p>But hope was kindled in the breast of J&iacute;vadatta, and he went
and propitiated with austerities the dweller in the Vindhya hills, and
she said to him in a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied with thee, so rise up and listen to this that
I am about to tell thee.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Anangarati in a former birth when she was a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; named Anangaprabh&aacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city on the Him&aacute;layas named
V&iacute;rapura; and in it there dwells a sovereign of
Vidy&aacute;dharas named Samara. He had a daughter, named
Anangaprabh&aacute;, born to him by his queen Anangavat&iacute;. When,
in the pride of her youth and beauty, she refused to have any husband,
her parents, enraged at her persistence, cursed her&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name="pb503">503</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Become a human being, and even in that state you shall not
enjoy the happiness of married life. When you are a maiden of sixteen
years, you shall abandon the body and come here. But an ugly mortal,
who has become such by a curse, on account of his falling in love with
the daughter of a hermit, and who possesses a magic sword, shall then
become your husband, and he shall carry you off against your will to
the world of mortals. There you, being unchaste, shall be separated
from your husband. Because that husband in a former life carried off
the wives of eight other men, he shall endure sorrow enough for eight
births. And you, having become a mortal by the loss of your
supernatural science, shall endure in that one birth the sufferings of
eight births.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10993src" href="#xd27e10993"
name="xd27e10993src">8</a> For to every one the association with the
evil gives an evil lot, but to women the union with an evil husband is
equivalent to evil. And having lost your memory of the past, you shall
there take many mortal husbands, because you obstinately persisted in
detesting the husband fitted for you. That Vidy&aacute;dhara
Madanaprabha, who, being equal in birth, demanded you in marriage,
shall become a mortal king and at last become your husband. Then you
shall be freed from your curse, and return to your own world, and you
shall obtain that suitable match, who shall have returned to his
Vidy&aacute;dhara state.&rdquo; So that maiden Anangaprabh&aacute; has
become Anangarati on the earth, and returning to her parents, has once
more become Anangaprabh&aacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So go to V&iacute;rapura and conquer in fight her father,
though he is possessed of knowledge and protected by his high birth,
and obtain that maiden. Now take this sword, and as long as you hold it
in your hand, you will be able to travel through the air, and moreover
you will be invincible.&rdquo; Having said this, and having given the
sword to him, the goddess vanished, and he woke up, and beheld in his
hand a heavenly sword. Then J&iacute;vadatta rose up delighted and
praised Durg&aacute;, and all the exhaustion produced by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504" name="pb504">504</a>]</span>his
penance was removed by the refreshment caused by the nectar of her
favour. And he flew up into the air with his sword in his hand, and
after roaming all round the Him&aacute;layas, he found that prince of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas Samara in V&iacute;rapura. He conquered him in
fight, and then the king gave him his daughter Anangaprabh&aacute;, and
he married her, and lived in heavenly felicity. And after he had
remained there some time, he said to his father-in-law Samara and to
his beloved Anangaprabh&aacute;, &ldquo;Let us two go to the world of
men, for I feel a longing for it, for one&rsquo;s native land is
exceedingly dear to living beings, even though it may be an inferior
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11083src" href="#xd27e11083"
name="xd27e11083src">9</a> When the father-in-law heard that, he
consented, but the far-seeing Anangaprabh&aacute; was with difficulty
induced to consent; then J&iacute;vadatta descended from heaven to the
world of mortals, taking that Anangaprabh&aacute; in his arms. And
Anangaprabh&aacute;, beholding there a pleasant mountain, being
wearied, said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Let us immediately rest here.&rdquo;
Then he consented, and descending there with her, he produced food and
drink by the power of the various sciences.<a id="xd27e11086" name=
"xd27e11086"></a> Then J&iacute;vadatta, being impelled by fate, said
to Anangaprabh&aacute;&mdash;&ldquo;Dear one, sing some sweet
song.&rdquo; When she heard that, she began to sing devoutly the praise
of &#346;iva, and with that sound of her singing the Br&aacute;hman was
sent to sleep.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a king, named Harivara, wearied out with hunting,
came that way in search of spring-water; he was attracted by hearing
the sound of that singing, as deer are attracted, and, leaving his
chariot, he went there alone. The king first had happiness announced by
omens, and then he beheld that Anangaprabh&aacute; like the real
brightness of the god of love. Then, as his heart was distracted with
her song and her beauty, the god of love cleft it at will with his
arrows. Anangaprabh&aacute; too, seeing that he was handsome, came
within the range of the god of the flowery bow, and said to
herself&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this? is he the god of love, without his
flowery bow? Is he the incarnation of the favour of &#346;iva towards
me, he being pleased with my song?&rdquo; Then maddened with love, she
asked him&mdash;&ldquo;Who are you, and how have you come to this
forest, tell me.&rdquo; Then the king told her who he was, and why he
had come; then he said to her, &ldquo;Tell me, who are you, fair one?
And who is this, O lotus-faced one, who is sleeping here?&rdquo; When
he asked these questions, she answered him briefly: &ldquo;I am a
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, and this is my husband, who possesses a magic
sword, and now I have fallen in love with you at first sight. So come,
let us quickly go to your city, before he awakes; then I will tell my
story at length.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he agreed, and felt
as much delighted as if he had obtained the sovereignty of the three
worlds. And Anangaprabh&aacute; hurriedly thought in her heart,
&ldquo;I will take this king in my arms, and quickly fly up to the
heaven,&rdquo; but in the meanwhile <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb505" href="#pb505" name="pb505">505</a>]</span>her knowledge was
stripped from her by her treachery to her husband; and remembering her
father&rsquo;s curse, she became at once despondent. When the king saw
that, he asked the cause, and then said to her&mdash;&ldquo;This is not
the time for despondency; your husband here may awake. And you ought
not to lament, my beloved, over this matter which depends on destiny.
For who can escape from the shadow of his own head, or the course of
destiny? So come, let us depart.&rdquo; When the king Harivara said
this, she consented to his proposal, and he took her quickly up in his
arms. Then he went off quickly thence, as delighted as if he had
obtained a treasure, and ascended his chariot, welcomed with joy by his
servants. And he reached his city in that chariot, which travelled
swift as thought, accompanied by his beloved, and he aroused curiosity
in his subjects. Then king Harivara remained in heavenly enjoyments in
that city, which was named after him, in the society of that
Anangaprabh&aacute;. And <span class="corr" id="xd27e11092" title=
"Source: An&aacute;ngaprabh&aacute;">Anangaprabh&aacute;</span>
remained there devotedly attached to him, forgetting all her
supernatural power, bewildered by the curse.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile J&iacute;vadatta woke up on the mountain, and saw
that not only Anangaprabh&aacute; was gone, but his sword also. He
thought &ldquo;Where is that Anangaprabh&aacute;? Alas! Where is that
sword? Has she gone off with it? Or were they both carried off by some
being?&rdquo; In his perplexity, he made many surmises of this sort,
and he searched that mountain for three days, being consumed with the
fire of love. Then he came down, and wandered through the forests for
ten days, but did not find a trace of her anywhere. He kept crying
out&mdash;&ldquo;Alas spiteful fortune, how did you carry off, together
with the magic power of the sword, my beloved Anangaprabh&aacute;, both
which you granted with difficulty?&rdquo; Thus employed he wandered
about without food, and at last reached a village, and there he entered
the opulent mansion of a Br&aacute;hman. There the handsome and
well-dressed mistress of the house, Priyadatt&aacute; by name, made him
sit down on a seat, and immediately gave this order to her
maids&mdash;&ldquo;Wash quickly the feet of this J&iacute;vadatta, for
to-day is the thirteenth day that he has gone without food on account
of his separation.&rdquo; When J&iacute;vadatta heard that, he was
astonished, and reflected in his own mind&mdash;&ldquo;Can
Anangaprabh&aacute; have come here, or is this woman a witch?&rdquo;
Thus he reflected, and after his feet were washed, and he had eaten the
food that she gave, he humbly asked Priyadatt&aacute; in his great
grief&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me one thing: how do you know my history,
blameless one? And tell me another thing, where are my sword and my
beloved gone?&rdquo; When the devoted wife Priyadatt&aacute; heard
that, she said&mdash;&ldquo;No one but my husband has any place in my
heart even in a dream, my son, and I look on all other men as brothers,
and no guest leaves my house without entertainment; by virtue of that I
know the past, the present and the future. And that Anangaprabh&aacute;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506" href="#pb506" name=
"pb506">506</a>]</span>of yours has been carried off by a king named
Harivara, living in a town named after him, who, as destiny would have
it, came that way, while you were asleep, attracted by her song. And
you cannot recover her, for that king is very powerful; moreover that
unchaste woman will in turn leave him and go to another man. And the
goddess Durg&aacute; gave you that sword only that you might obtain
that lady; having accomplished that, the weapon, in virtue of its
divine nature, has returned to the goddess, as the lady has been
carried off. Moreover, how have you forgotten what the goddess was
pleased to tell you, when she told the story of the curse of
Anangaprabh&aacute;? So why are you so distracted about an event, which
was destined to take place? Abandon this chain of sins, which again and
again produces extreme sorrow. And of what profit can be to you now, my
brother, that wicked female, who is attached to another, and who has
become a mortal, having lost her science by her treachery against
you?&rdquo; When that virtuous woman said this to J&iacute;vadatta, he
abandoned all passion for Anangaprabh&aacute;, being disgusted with her
fickleness, and thus answered the Br&aacute;hman
lady&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, my delusion has been brought to an end by
this true speech of thine; whom does not association with persons of
virtuous conduct benefit? This misfortune has befallen me in
consequence of my former crimes, so I will abandon jealousy, and go to
holy places to wash them out. What can I gain by taking up an enmity
with others on account of Anangaprabh&aacute;? For one, who has
conquered anger, conquers this whole world.&rdquo; While he was saying
this, the righteous husband of Priyadatt&aacute;, who was hospitable to
guests, returned to the house. The husband also welcomed him, and made
him forget his grief, and then he rested, and taking leave of them
both, started on his pilgrimage to holy places.</p>
<p>Then, in course of time, he roamed round to all the holy
bathing-places on the earth, enduring many toils in difficult ways,
living on roots and fruits. And after visiting holy bathing-places, he
went to the shrine of the dweller in the Vindhya hills; there he went
through a severe penance, without food, on a bed of <i>ku&#347;a</i>
grass. And Ambik&aacute;, satisfied with his asceticism, said to him,
appearing to him in bodily form&mdash;&ldquo;Rise up, my son, for you
four are four <i>ga&#7751;as</i> of mine. Three are Pancham&uacute;la,
Chaturvaktra, and Mahodaramukha, and thou art the fourth, last in
order, and thy name is Vika&#7789;avadana. You four once went to the
sand of the Ganges to amuse yourselves, and saw there a hermit&rsquo;s
daughter bathing. She was called Ch&aacute;palekh&aacute;, the daughter
of Kapilaja&#7789;a. And she was solicited by all of you, distracted
with love. When she said &lsquo;I am a maiden, go away all of
you,&rsquo; the three others remained quiet, but thou didst forcibly
seize her by the arm. And she cried out&mdash;&lsquo;Father, Father,
deliver me.&rsquo; Then the hermit, who was near, came up in wrath.
Then thou didst let go her arm; then he immediately cursed you,
saying&mdash;&lsquo;Wicked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href=
"#pb507" name="pb507">507</a>]</span>ones, be born, all of you, as
human beings.&rsquo; Then you asked the hermit that the curse might
end, and he said&mdash;&lsquo;When the princess Anangarati shall be
demanded in marriage by you, and shall go to the Vidy&aacute;dhara
world, then three of you shall be released from your curse. But when
she has become a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, then thou,
Vika&#7789;avadana, shalt gain her, and lose her again, and then thou
shalt suffer great sorrow. But after propitiating the goddess
Durg&aacute; for a long time, thou shalt be released from this curse.
This will happen to thee, because thou didst touch the hand of this
Ch&aacute;palekh&aacute;, and also because thou hast much guilt
attaching to thee, on account of having carried off the wives of
others.&rsquo; You four <i>ga&#7751;as</i> of mine, whom that hermit
thus cursed, became four heroes in the Dekhan,
Panchaphu&#7789;&#7789;ika, and Bh&aacute;sh&aacute;jna, and
Kha&#7693;gadhara, these three friends, and you the fourth
J&iacute;vadatta. Now the first three, when Anangarati returned to her
own place, came here, and by my favour were freed from their curse. And
thou hast propitiated me now, therefore thy curse is at an end. So take
this fiery meditation, and abandon this body; and consume at once the
guilt, which it would take eight births to exhaust.&rdquo; When the
goddess Durg&aacute; had said this, she gave him the meditation, and
disappeared. And with that meditation he burned up his wicked mortal
body, and at last was freed from the curse, and became once more an
excellent <i>ga&#7751;a</i>. When even gods have to endure so much
suffering by associating with the wives of others, what must be the
result of it to inferior beings?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Anangaprabh&aacute; became head-queen in Harivara,
the city of the king Harivara. And the king remained day and night with
his mind fixed on her, and entrusted the great burden of his kingdom to
his minister named Sumantra. And once on a time there came to that king
from Madhyade&#347;a,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11117src" href=
"#xd27e11117" name="xd27e11117src">10</a> a fresh teacher of dancing,
named Labdhavara. The king, having seen his skill in music and dancing,
honoured him, and made him the instructor in dancing of the ladies of
the harem. He brought Anangaprabh&aacute; to such excellence in
dancing, that she was an object of admiration even to her rival wives.
And from associating with the professor of dancing, and from the
delight she took in his teaching, she fell in love with him. And the
professor of dancing, attracted by her youth and beauty, gradually
learnt a new strange<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11120src" href=
"#xd27e11120" name="xd27e11120src">11</a> dance, thanks to the god of
Love. And once she approached the professor of dancing secretly in the
dancing-hall, and being desperately in love with him, said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not be able to live for a moment without you,
and the king Harivara, when he hears of it, will not tolerate it, so
come, let us depart elsewhere, where the king will not find us out. You
have wealth in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508"
name="pb508">508</a>]</span>form of gold, horses, and camels, given by
the king, pleased with your dancing, and I have ornaments. So let us
quickly go and dwell where we shall be secure.&rdquo; The professor of
dancing was pleased with her proposal, and consented to this. Then she
put on the dress of a man, and went to the house of the professor of
dancing, accompanied by one female servant, who was exceedingly devoted
to her. Thence she started on horseback, with that teacher of dancing,
who placed his wealth on the back of a camel. First she abandoned the
splendour of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, then of a throne, and now she put
herself under the shelter of a bard&rsquo;s fortune; alas! fickle is
the mind of women! And so Anangaprabh&aacute; went with the teacher of
dancing, and reached a distant city named Viyogapura. There she dwelt
in happiness with him, and the distinguished dancer thought that by
obtaining her his name of Labdhavara<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11131src" href="#xd27e11131" name="xd27e11131src">12</a> had been
justified.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile king Harivara, finding out that his beloved
Anangaprabh&aacute; had gone somewhere or other, was ready to abandon
the body out of grief. Then the minister Sumantra said to the king to
comfort him, &ldquo;Why do you appear as if you do not understand the
matter? Consider it yourself? How, my sovereign, could you expect that
a woman, who deserted a husband, that had by means of his sword
obtained the power of a Vidy&aacute;dhara, and repaired to you as soon
as she saw you, would be faithful even to you? She has gone off with
something that she has managed to get, having no desire for anything
good, as one to whom a blade of grass is a sprout of jewels, falling in
love at sight with a blade of grass. Certainly the teacher of dancing
has gone off with her, for he is nowhere to be seen. And I hear that
they both were in the concert-hall in the morning. So tell me, king;
why are you so persistent about her, though you know all this? The
truth is, a fickle dame is like a sunset, momentarily aglow for every
one.&rdquo; When the minister said this to him, the king fell into a
musing, and thought&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, that wise man has told me the
truth. For a fickle dame is like human life; connexion with her is
unstable, she changes every moment, and is terrible, bringing disgust
at the end. The wise man never falls into the power of deep rivers or
of women, both which drown him who falls into their power, while they
exhibit wanton sportfulness. Those men are truly masters of themselves,
who are free from excitement about pleasures, who are not puffed up in
prosperity, and who are unshrinking in dangers; such men have conquered
the world.&rdquo; After saying this, king Harivara abandoned his grief
by the advice of his minister, and remained satisfied with the society
of his own wives.</p>
<p>And after Anangaprabh&aacute; had dwelt some time with the teacher
of dancing, in the city named Viyogapura, he, as fate would have it,
struck up an acquaintance with a young gambler named Sudar&#347;ana;
then the gambler, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href="#pb509"
name="pb509">509</a>]</span>before the eyes of Anangaprabh&aacute;,
soon stripped the teacher of dancing of all his wealth. Then
Anangaprabh&aacute; deserted her husband, who was stripped of all his
fortune, as if in anger on that account, and threw herself into the
arms of Sudar&#347;ana. Then the teacher of dancing, having lost his
wife and his wealth, having no refuge, in disgust with the world,
matted his hair in a knot, and went to the banks of the Ganges to
practise mortification of the flesh. But Anangaprabh&aacute;, who was
ever taking new paramours, remained with that gambler. But one night,
her lord Sudar&#347;ana was robbed of all that he had by some robbers,
who entered his house in the darkness. Then Sudar&#347;ana, seeing that
Anangaprabh&aacute; was uncomfortable and unhappy on account of their
poverty, said to her: &ldquo;Come and let us borrow something from a
rich friend of mine, named Hira&#7751;yagupta, a distinguished
merchant.&rdquo; After saying this, he, being deprived of his senses by
destiny, went with his wife, and asked that great merchant
Hira&#7751;yagupta to lend him some money. And the merchant, when he
saw her, immediately <span class="corr" id="xd27e11142" title=
"Source: felt">fell</span> in love with her, and she also with him, the
moment that she beheld him. And the merchant said politely to
Sudar&#347;ana&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow I will give you gold, but dine
here to-day.&rdquo; When Sudar&#347;ana heard this, beholding the
altered bearing of those two, he said&mdash;&ldquo;I did not come here
to-day to dine.&rdquo; Then the great merchant said&mdash;&ldquo;If
this be the case, at any rate let your wife dine here, my friend, for
this is the first time that she has visited my house.&rdquo; When
Sudar&#347;ana was thus addressed by him, he remained silent in spite
of his cunning, and that merchant went into his house with
Anangaprabh&aacute;. There he indulged in drinking and other pastimes
with that fair one, unexpectedly thrown in his way, who was merry with
all the wantonness of wine. But Sudar&#347;ana, who was standing
outside, waiting for her to come out, had the following message brought
to him by the merchant&rsquo;s servants, in accordance with their
master&rsquo;s orders: &ldquo;Your wife has dined and gone
home<span class="corr" id="xd27e11145" title="Source: :">;</span> you
must have failed to see her going out. So what are you doing here so
long? Go home.&rdquo; He answered&mdash;&ldquo;She is within the house,
she has not come out, and I will not depart.&rdquo; Thereupon the
merchant&rsquo;s servants drove him away from the house with kicks.
Then Sudar&#347;ana went off, and sorrowfully reflected with himself:
&ldquo;What! has this merchant, though my friend, robbed me of my wife?
Or rather, in this very birth the fruit of my sin has in such a form
fallen to my lot. For what I did to one, another has done to me. Why
should I then be angry with another, when my own deeds merit anger? So
I will sever the chain of works, so that I may not be again
humiliated.&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the gambler abandoned his anger,
and going to the hermitage of Badarik&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11148src" href="#xd27e11148" name="xd27e11148src">13</a> he
proceeded to perform such austerities as would cut the bonds of mundane
existence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb510" href="#pb510" name=
"pb510">510</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Anangaprabh&aacute;, having obtained that exceedingly handsome
merchant for a dear husband, was as pleased as a bee that has lighted
on a flower. And in course of time she attained undisputed control over
the wealth, as well as over the heart of that opulent merchant, who was
deeply in love with her. But the king V&iacute;rab&aacute;hu, though he
heard of the matchless beauty residing there, did not carry her off,
but remained strictly within the limits of virtue. And in course of
time, the wealth of the merchant began to diminish, on account of the
expenditure of Anangaprabh&aacute;; for, in a house presided over by an
unchaste woman, Fortune pines as well as virtuous women. Then the
merchant Hira&#7751;yagupta got together wares, and went off to an
island named Suvarnabh&uacute;mi to trade, and he took that
Anangaprabh&aacute; with him, out of fear of being separated from her,
and journeying on his way, he at last reached the city of
S&aacute;garapura. There he fell in with a chief of fishermen, a native
of that place, S&aacute;garav&iacute;ra by name, whom he found in that
city near the sea. He went with that sea-faring man to the shore of the
sea, and with his beloved embarked on a ship which he provided. And
after the merchant had travelled in anxiety for some days over the sea,
in that ship, accompanied by S&aacute;garav&iacute;ra, one day a
terrible black cloud of doom appeared, with flashing eyes of lightning,
filling them with fear of destruction. Then that ship, smitten by a
mighty wind, with a violent shower of rain, began to sink in the waves.
That merchant Hira&#7751;yagupta, when the crew raised a cry of
lamentation, and the ship began to break up like his own hopes,
fastened his cloak round his loins, and looking at the face of
Anangaprabh&aacute;, exclaimed &ldquo;Ah! my beloved, where art
thou,&rdquo; and threw himself into the sea. And he oared himself along
with his arms, and, as luck would have it, he reached a merchant-ship,
and he caught hold of it, and climbed up into it.</p>
<p>But that S&aacute;garav&iacute;ra tied together some planks with a
cord, and quickly placed Anangaprabh&aacute; upon them. And he himself
climbed up upon them, and comforted that terrified woman, and went
paddling along in the sea, throwing aside the water with his arms. And
as soon as the ship had been broken to pieces, the clouds disappeared
from the heaven, and the sea was calm, like a good man whose wrath is
appeased. But the merchant Hira&#7751;yagupta, after climbing up into
the ship, which was impelled by the wind, as fate would have it,
reached in five days the shore of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb511" href="#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>sea. Then he went on
shore, grieved at the loss of his beloved, but he reflected that the
dispensations of Destiny were irremediable; and he went slowly home to
his own city, and being of resolute soul, he recovered his
self-command, and again acquired wealth, and lived in great
comfort.</p>
<p>But Anangaprabh&aacute;, seated on the plank, was piloted to the
shore of the sea in one day by S&aacute;garav&iacute;ra. And there that
chief of the fishermen, consoling her, took her to his own palace in
the city of S&aacute;garapura. There Anangaprabh&aacute;, reflecting
that that chief of the fishermen was a hero who had saved her life, and
was equal to a king in opulence, and in the prime of youth and good
looks, and obedient to her orders, made him her husband: a woman who
has lost her virtue does not distinguish between high and low. Then she
dwelt with that chief of fishermen, enjoying in his house his wealth
that he put at her disposal.</p>
<p>One day she saw from the roof of the palace a handsome Kshatriya
youth, named Vijayavarman, going along the high street of the town.
Falling in love with his good looks, she went up to him, and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Receive me, who am in love with you, for my mind has
been fascinated by the sight of you.&rdquo; And he gladly welcomed that
fairest woman of the three worlds, who had fallen to him, as it were,
from the sky, and took her home to his house. But
S&aacute;garav&iacute;ra, finding that his beloved had gone somewhere
or other, abandoned all, and went to the river Ganges, intending to
leave the body by means of ascetic practices; and no wonder that his
grief was great, for how could a man of servile caste ever have
expected to obtain such a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;? But
Anangaprabh&aacute; lived at ease in that very town with Vijayavarman,
free from restraint.</p>
<p>Then, one day the king of that place, named S&aacute;garavarman,
mounted a female elephant and went out to roam round his city. And
while the king was looking at that well-built city named after him, he
came along the street where the house of Vijayavarman was. And
Anangaprabh&aacute;, finding out that the king was coming that way,
went up to the top of the house, out of curiosity to behold him. And,
the moment she saw the king, she fell so desperately in love with him,
that she insolently exclaimed to the
elephant-driver&mdash;&ldquo;Mahout, I never in my life have ridden on
an elephant, so give me a ride on yours, and let me see how pleasant it
is.&rdquo; When the elephant-driver heard this, he looked at the face
of the king, and in the meanwhile the king beheld her, like the
splendour of the moon fallen from heaven. And the king, drinking her in
with insatiate eye like a partridge, having conceived the hope of
gaining her, said to his elephant-driver&mdash;&ldquo;Take the elephant
near and comply with her wish, and without delay seat this moon-faced
dame on the elephant.&rdquo; When the king said this, the
elephant-driver at once brought that elephant close under the house.
When Anangaprabh&aacute; saw that the elephant had come near, she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512" name=
"pb512">512</a>]</span>immediately flung herself into the lap of the
king S&aacute;garavarman. How came it that, though at first she was
averse to a husband, she now showed such an insatiable appetite for
husbands? Surely her father&rsquo;s curse made her exhibit a great
change of character. And she clasped the king round the neck, as if
afraid of falling, and he, when his limbs were irrigated with the
nectar of her touch, was much delighted. And the king quickly carried
off to his own palace her, who had surrendered herself by an artifice,
being desirous of being kissed. There he made that
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; enter his harem, and after she had told him
her story, he made her his principal wife. And then that young
Kshatriya, finding out that she had been carried off by the king, came
and attacked the king&rsquo;s servants outside the palace, and there he
left his corpse, not turning his back in fight, for brave men do not
submit to insult on account of a woman. And it seemed as if he was
carried off to the abode of the gods by the nymphs of heaven,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;What have you to do with this contemptible woman?
Come to Nandana and court us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for that Anangaprabh&aacute;, when she had come into the
possession of the king S&aacute;garavarman, she roamed no more, but
remained faithful to him, as rivers are at rest in the bosom of the
sea. And owing to the force of destiny, she thought herself fortunate
in having obtained that husband, and he thought that his life was
complete by his having obtained her for a wife.</p>
<p>And in some days Anangaprabh&aacute;, the queen of that king
S&aacute;garavarman, became pregnant, and in due time gave birth to a
son. And the king made a great feast on account of the birth of a noble
son, and gave the boy the name of Samudravarman. And when that son
attained his full stature, and became a young man distinguished for
might, the king appointed him crown-prince. Then he brought to his
court Kamalavat&iacute; the daughter of a certain king named
Samaravarman, to be married to him. And when that son Samudravarman was
married, the king, being impressed by his virtues, gave him his own
kingdom. That brave son Samudravarman, being thoroughly acquainted with
the duties of Kshatriyas, when he had obtained the kingdom, said to his
father, bowing before him: &ldquo;Father, give me leave to depart; I am
setting out to conquer the regions. A lord of earth, that is not intent
on conquest, is to be blamed as much as the effeminate husband of a
woman. And in this world, only that fortune of kings is righteous and
glorious, which is acquired by one&rsquo;s own strength after
conquering the kingdoms. What is the use, father, of the sovereignty of
those kings, who hold it merely for the sake of oppressing the poor?
They devour their own subjects, ravenous like cats.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11176src" href="#xd27e11176" name=
"xd27e11176src">14</a> When he had said this, his father
S&aacute;garavarman replied, &ldquo;Your rule, my boy, is young; so for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name=
"pb513">513</a>]</span>the present secure that; no demerit or disgrace
attaches to one who rules his subjects justly. And war is not meet for
kings without considering their power; though, you my child, are a
hero, and your army is numerous, still you ought not to rely upon the
fortune of victory, which is fickle in fight.&rdquo; Though his father
used these and similar arguments with him, the brave Samudravarman at
last, with great difficulty, induced him to consent, and marched out to
conquer the regions. And having conquered the regions in due course,
and reduced the kings under his sway, he returned to his own city in
possession of elephants, horses, gold, and other tributes. And there he
humbly honoured the feet of his delighted parents with great jewels
produced in various regions. And the glorious prince gave, by their
orders, to the Br&aacute;hmans great gifts of elephants, horses, gold
and jewels. Then he showered gold in such profusion upon suppliants and
servants, that the only thing in the country devoid of wealth was the
word poor, which had become without meaning.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11183src" href="#xd27e11183" name="xd27e11183src">15</a> The king
S&aacute;garavarman, dwelling with Anangaprabh&aacute;, when he beheld
the glory of his son, considered that his objects in life had been
accomplished.</p>
<p>And the king, after spending those days in feasting, said to his son
Samudravarman in the presence of the ministers&mdash;&ldquo;I have
accomplished, my son, what I had to accomplish in this birth; I have
enjoyed the pleasures of rule, I have not experienced defeat from my
enemies, and I have seen you in possession of sovereignty, what else
does there remain for me to obtain? So I will retire to a holy
bathing-place, while my body retains strength. For see, old age
whispers at the root of my ear&mdash;&lsquo;Since this body is
perishable, why do you still remain in your house?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
Having said this, the king S&aacute;garavarman, all whose ends were
attained, went, though his son was opposed to it, to Pray&aacute;ga
with his beloved. And Samudravarman escorted his father there, and,
after returning to his own city, ruled it in accordance with the
law.</p>
<p>And the king S&aacute;garavarman, accompanied by his wife
Anangaprabh&aacute;, propitiated the god &#346;iva in Pray&aacute;ga
with asceticism. And at the end of the night, the god said to him in a
dream&mdash;&ldquo;I am pleased with this penance of yourself and your
wife, so hear this&mdash;This Anangaprabh&aacute; and you, my son, are
both of the Vidy&aacute;dhara race, and to-morrow the curse will
expire, and you will go to your own world.&rdquo; When the king heard
that, he woke up, and Anangaprabh&aacute; too, who had seen a similar
dream, and they told their dreams to one another. And then
Anangaprabh&aacute;, delighted, said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;My
husband, I have now remembered all the history of my former birth; I am
the daughter of Samara, a prince of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, in the city
of V&iacute;rapura, and my name has always been Anangaprabh&aacute;.
And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514" name=
"pb514">514</a>]</span>I came here owing to the curse of my father,
having become a human being by the loss of my science, and I forgot my
Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute; nature. But now I have recovered consciousness
of it.&rdquo; While she was saying this, her father Samara descended
from heaven; and after he had been respectfully welcomed by the king
S&aacute;garavarman, he said to that daughter Anangaprabh&aacute;, who
fell at his feet, &ldquo;Come, daughter, receive these sciences, your
curse is at an end. For you have endured in one birth the sorrows of
eight births.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11195src" href=
"#xd27e11195" name="xd27e11195src">16</a> Saying this, he took her on
his lap, and gave her back the sciences; then he said to the king
S&aacute;garavarman&mdash;&ldquo;You are a prince of the
Vidy&aacute;dharas, named <span class="corr" id="xd27e11198" title=
"Source: Madanaprabh&aacute;">Madanaprabha</span>, and I am by name
Samara, and Anangaprabh&aacute; is my daughter. And long ago, when she
ought to have been given in marriage, her hand was demanded by several
suitors, but being intoxicated by her beauty, she did not desire any
husband. Then she was asked in marriage by you, who were equal in
merit, and very eager to marry her, but as fate would have it, she
would not then accept even you. For that reason I cursed her, that she
might go to the world of mortals. And you, being passionately in love
with her, fixed your heart on &#346;iva the giver of boons, and wished
intently that she might be your wife in the world of mortals, and then
you abandoned your Vidy&aacute;dhara body by magic art. Then you became
a man and she became your wife. Now return to your own world linked
together.&rdquo; When Samara said this to S&aacute;garavarman, he,
remembering his birth, abandoned his body in the water of
Pray&aacute;ga,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11201src" href="#xd27e11201"
name="xd27e11201src">17</a> and immediately became Madanaprabha. And
Anangaprabh&aacute; was rekindled with the brightness of her recovered
science, and immediately becoming a Vidy&aacute;dhar&iacute;, gleamed
with that very body, which underwent a heavenly change. And then
Madanaprabha, being delighted, and Anangaprabh&aacute; also, feeling
great passion stir in both their hearts at the sight of one
another&rsquo;s heavenly bodies, and the auspicious Samara, king of the
sky-goers, all flew up into the air, and went together to that city of
the Vidy&aacute;dharas, V&iacute;rapura. And there Samara immediately
gave, with due rites, his daughter Anangaprabh&aacute; to the
Vidy&aacute;dhara king, Madanaprabha. And Madanaprabha went with that
beloved, whose curse had been cancelled, to his own city, and there he
dwelt at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus divine beings fall by virtue of a curse, and owing to
the consequences of their own wickedness, are incarnate in the world of
men, and after reaping the fruit appropriate to their bad conduct, they
again go to their own home on account of previously acquired
merit.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515" name=

<p class="first">Then, on the next day, Narav&aacute;hanadatta&rsquo;s
friend Marubh&uacute;ti said to him, when he was in the company of
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;&mdash;&ldquo;See, king, this miserable
dependent<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11224src" href="#xd27e11224" name=

leather, with matted hair, thin and dirty, and never leaves the royal
gate, day or night, in cold or heat; so why do you not shew him favour
at last? For it is better that a little should be given in time, than
much when it is too late; so have mercy on him before he dies.&rdquo;
When Gomukha heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Marubh&uacute;ti speaks
well, but you, king, are not the least in fault in this matter; for
until a suitor&rsquo;s guilt, which stands in his way, is removed, a
king, even though disposed to give, cannot give; but when a man&rsquo;s
guilt is effaced, a king gives, though strenuously dissuaded from doing
so; this depends upon works in a previous state of existence. And

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was on the earth a city named Lakshapura. In it
there lived a king named Lakshadatta, chief of generous men. He never
knew how to give a petitioner less than a lac of coins, but he gave
five lacs to any one with whom he conversed. As for the man with whom
he was pleased, he lifted him out of poverty, for this reason his name
was called Lakshadatta. A certain dependent named Labdhadatta stood day
and night at his gate, with a piece of leather for his only loin-rag.
He had matted hair, and he never left the king&rsquo;s gate for a
second, day or night, in cold, rain, or heat, and the king saw him
there. And, though he remained there long in misery, the king did not
give him anything, though he was generous and compassionate.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516" name=
"pb516">516</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, one day the king went to a forest to hunt, and his dependent
followed him with a staff in his hand. There, while the king seated on
an elephant, armed with a bow, and followed by his army, slew tigers,
bears, and deer, with showers of arrows, his dependent, going in front
of him, alone on foot, slew with his staff many boars and deer. When
the king saw his bravery, he thought in his heart&mdash;&ldquo;It is
wonderful that this man should be such a hero,&rdquo; but he did not
give him anything. And the king, when he had finished his hunting,
returned home to his city, to enjoy himself, but that dependent stood
at his palace-gate as before. Once on a time, Lakshadatta went out to
conquer a neighbouring king of the same family, and he had a terrible
battle. And in the battle the dependent struck down in front of him
many enemies, with blows from the end of his strong staff of acacia
wood. And the king, after conquering his enemies, returned to his own
city, and though he had seen the valour of his dependent, he gave him
nothing. In this condition the dependent Labdhadatta remained, and many
years passed over his head, while he supported himself with
difficulty.</p>
<p>And when the sixth year had come, king Lakshadatta happened to see
him one day, and feeling pity for him, reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Though he
has been long afflicted, I have not as yet given him anything, so why
should I not give him something in a disguised form, and so find out
whether the guilt of this poor man has been effaced, or not, and
whether even now Fortune will grant him a sight of her, or not.&rdquo;
Thus reflecting, the king deliberately entered his treasury, and filled
a citron with jewels, as if it were a casket. And he held an assembly
of all his subjects, having appointed a meeting outside his palace, and
there entered the assembly all his citizens, chiefs, and ministers. And
when the dependent entered among them, the king said to him with an
affectionate voice, &ldquo;Come here;&rdquo; then the dependent, on
hearing this, was delighted, and coming near, he sat in front of the
king. Then the king said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Utter some composition of
your own.&rdquo; Then the dependent recited the following
&Aacute;ry&aacute; verse&mdash;&ldquo;Fortune ever replenishes the full
man, as all the streams replenish the sea, but she never even comes
within the range of the eyes of the poor.&rdquo; When the king had
heard this, and had made him recite it again, he was pleased, and gave
him the citron full of valuable jewels. And the people said,
&ldquo;This king puts a stop to the poverty of every one with whom he
is pleased; so this dependent is to be pitied, since this very king,
though pleased with him, after summoning him politely, has given him
nothing but this citron; a wishing-tree, in the case of ill-starred
men, often becomes a <i>pal&aacute;&#347;a</i>-tree.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11262src" href="#xd27e11262" name=
"xd27e11262src">3</a> These were the words which all in the assembly
said to one another in their despondency, when they saw that, for they
did not know the truth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href=
"#pb517" name="pb517">517</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the dependent went out, with the citron in his hand, and when he
was in a state of despondency, a mendicant came before him. And that
mendicant, named R&aacute;javandin, seeing that the citron was a fine
one, obtained it from that dependent by giving him a garment. And then
the mendicant entered the assembly, and gave that fruit to the king,
and the king, recognizing it, said to that hermit,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11271src" href="#xd27e11271" name="xd27e11271src">4</a>
&ldquo;Where, reverend sir, did you procure this citron.&rdquo; Then he
told the king that the dependent had given it to him. Then the king was
grieved and astonished, reflecting that his guilt was not expiated even
now. The king Lakshadatta took the citron, rose up from the assembly,
and performed the duties of the day. And the dependent sold the
garment, and after he had eaten and drunk, remained at his usual post
at the king&rsquo;s gate.</p>
<p>And on the second day the king held a general assembly, and
everybody appeared at it again, citizens and all. And the king, seeing
that the dependent had entered the assembly, called him as before, and
made him sit near him. And after making him again recite that very same
&Aacute;ry&aacute; verse, being pleased, he gave him that very same
citron with jewels concealed in it. And all there thought with
astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! this is the second time that our master
is pleased with him without his gaining by it. And the dependent, in
despondency, took the citron in his hand, and thinking that the
king&rsquo;s good will had again been barren of results, went out. At
that very moment a certain official met him, who was about to enter
that assembly, wishing to see the king. He, when he saw that citron,
took a fancy to it, and regarding the omen, procured it from the
dependent by giving him a pair of garments. And entering the
king&rsquo;s court, he fell at the feet of the sovereign, and first
gave him the citron, and then another present of his own. And when the
king recognised the fruit, he asked the official where he got it, and
he replied&mdash;&ldquo;From the dependent.&rdquo; And the king,
thinking in his heart that Fortune would not even now give the
dependent a sight of her, was exceedingly sad.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11276src" href="#xd27e11276" name="xd27e11276src">5</a> And he
rose up from the assembly with that citron, and the dependent went to
the market with the pair of garments he had got. And by selling one
garment he procured meat and drink, and tearing the other in half he
made two of it. Then on the third day also the king held a general
assembly, and all the subjects entered, as before, and when the
dependent entered, the king gave him the same citron again, after
calling him and making him recite the &Aacute;ry&aacute; verse. Then
all were astonished, and the dependent went out, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href="#pb518" name="pb518">518</a>]</span>gave
that citron to the king&rsquo;s mistress. And she, like a moving
creeper of the tree of the king&rsquo;s regard, gave him gold, which
was, so to speak, the flower, the harbinger of the fruit. The dependent
sold it, and enjoyed himself that day, and the king&rsquo;s mistress
went into his presence. And she gave him that citron, which was large
and fine, and he, recognising it, asked her whence she procured it.
Then she said&mdash;&ldquo;The dependent gave it me.&rdquo; Hearing
that, the king thought, &ldquo;Fortune has not yet looked favourably
upon him; his merit in a former life must have been slight, since he
does not know that my favour is never barren of results. And so these
splendid jewels come back to me again and again.&rdquo; Thus the king
reflected, and he took that citron, and put it away safely, and rose up
and performed the duties of the day. And on the fourth day the king
held an assembly in the same way, and it was filled with all his
subjects, feudatories, ministers and all. And the dependent came there
again, and again the king made him sit in front of him, and when he
bowed before him, the king made him recite the &Aacute;ry&aacute;
verse: and gave him the citron, and when the dependent had half got
hold of it, he suddenly let it go, and the citron fell on the ground
and broke in half. And as the joining of the citron, which kept it
together, was broken, there rolled out of it many valuable jewels,
illuminating that place of assembly. All the people, when they saw it,
said, &ldquo;Ah! we were deluded and mistaken, as we did not know the
real state of the case, but such is the nature of the king&rsquo;s
favour.&rdquo; When the king heard that, he said&mdash;&ldquo;By this
artifice I endeavoured to ascertain, whether Fortune would now look on
him or not. But for three days his guilt was not effaced; now it is
effaced, and for that reason Fortune has now granted him a sight of
herself.&rdquo; After the king had said this, he gave the dependent
those jewels, and also villages, elephants, horses and gold, and made
him a feudal chief. And he rose up from that assembly, in which the
people applauded, and went to bathe; and that dependent too, having
obtained his ends, went to his own dwelling.</p>
<p>So true is it that, until a servant&rsquo;s guilt is effaced, he
cannot obtain the favour of his master; even by going through hundreds
of hardships.</p>
<p>When Gomukha the prime-minister had told this tale, he again said to
his master Narav&aacute;hanadatta; &ldquo;So, king, I know that even
now the guilt of that dependent of yours is not expiated, since even
now you are not pleased with him.&rdquo; When the son of the king of
Vatsa heard this speech of Gomukha&rsquo;s, he said, &ldquo;Ha!
good!&rdquo; and he immediately gave to his own dependent, who was
named K&aacute;rpa&#7789;ika, a number of villages, elephants and
horses, a crore of gold pieces, and excellent garments, and ornaments.
Then that dependent, who had attained prosperity, became like a king;
how can the attendance on a grateful king, who has excellent courtiers,
be void of fruit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb519" href="#pb519"
name="pb519">519</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta was thus employed, there came one day,
to take service with him, a young Br&aacute;hman from the Dekhan, named
Pralambab&aacute;hu. That hero said to the prince: &ldquo;I have come
to your feet, my sovereign, attracted by your renown; and I on foot
will never leave your company for a step, as long as you travel on the
earth with elephants, horses, and chariots; but in the air I cannot go;
I say this because it is rumoured that my lord will one day be emperor
of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. A hundred gold pieces should be given to me
every day as salary.&rdquo; When that Br&aacute;hman, who was really of
incomparable might, said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta gave him this
salary. And thereupon Gomukha said&mdash;&ldquo;My lord, kings have
such servants: <i>&agrave; propos</i> of this, hear this
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">There is in this country a great and splendid city of
the name of Vikramapura. In it there lived long ago a king named
Vikramatunga. He was distinguished for statesmanship, and though his
sword was sharp, his rod of justice was not so<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11298" title="Source: :">;</span> and he was always intent on
righteousness, but not on women, hunting, and so forth. And while he
was king, the only atoms of wickedness were the atoms of earth in the
dust, the only departure from virtue was the loosing of arrows from the
string, the only straying from justice was the wandering of sheep in
the folds of the keepers of cattle.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11301src" href="#xd27e11301" name="xd27e11301src">7</a> Once on a
time a heroic and handsome Br&aacute;hman, from the country of
M&aacute;lava, named V&iacute;ravara, came there to take service under
that king; he had a wife named Dharmavat&iacute;, a daughter named
V&iacute;ravat&iacute;, and a son named Sattvavara; these three
constituted his family; and his attendants consisted of another
three<span class="corr" id="xd27e11313" title="Source: ,">:</span> at
his hip a dagger, in one hand a sword, and in the other a polished
shield. Though he had such a small following, he demanded from that
king five hundred <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> every day by way of
salary. And the king gave him that salary, perceiving his courage, and
thinking to himself, &ldquo;I will make trial of his excellence.&rdquo;
And the king set spies on him, to find out what this man, with only two
arms, would do with so many <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>. And
V&iacute;ravara, every day, gave his wife a hundred of those
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> for food and other purposes; and with
another hundred he bought clothes, and garlands, and so on; and he
appointed a third hundred, after bathing, for the worship of
Vish&#7751;u and &#346;iva; and the remaining two hundred he gave to
Br&aacute;hmans, the poor and so on; and so he expended every day the
whole five hundred. And he stood at the palace-gate of the king for the
first half of the day, and after he had performed his daily prayers and
other duties, he came back and remained there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb520" href="#pb520" name="pb520">520</a>]</span>at
night also. The spies reported to the king continually that daily
practice of his, and then the king, being satisfied, ordered those
spies to desist from observing him. And <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11328" title="Source: Viravara">V&iacute;ravara</span> remained
day and night at the gate of the king&rsquo;s palace, sword in hand,
excepting only the time set apart for bathing and matters of that kind.
Then there came a collection of clouds, bellowing terribly, as if
determined to conquer that V&iacute;ravara, being impatient of his
valour. And then, though the cloud rained a terrible arrow-shower of
drops, V&iacute;ravara stood like a column and did not leave the
palace-gate. And the king Vikramatunga, having beheld him from the
palace in this position, went up to the roof of the palace at night to
try him again. And he called out from above&mdash;&ldquo;Who waits at
the palace-gate?&rdquo; And V&iacute;ravara, when he heard that,
answered&mdash;&ldquo;I am here.&rdquo; The king hearing this,
thought&mdash;&ldquo;Surely this brave man deserves high rank, for he
does not leave the palace-gate, though such a cloud is raining.&rdquo;
While engaged in these reflections, the king heard a woman weeping
bitterly in the distance; and he thought&mdash;&ldquo;There is not an
afflicted person in my dominions, so why does she weep?&rdquo;
Thereupon he said to V&iacute;ravara, &ldquo;Hark, V&iacute;ravara,
there is some woman weeping at some distance from this place, so go,
and find out who she is, and what is her sorrow.&rdquo; When
V&iacute;ravara heard that, he set out, brandishing his sword, with his
dagger at his side. Then the king, seeing that he had set out when such
a cloud was blazing with lightning, and when the interval between
heaven and earth<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11331src" href=
"#xd27e11331" name="xd27e11331src">8</a> was full of descending drops
of rain, being moved with curiosity and pity, came down from the roof
of his palace, and set out behind him, sword in hand, unobserved.</p>
<p>And V&iacute;ravara, going in the direction of the wailing,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11339src" href="#xd27e11339" name=
"xd27e11339src">9</a> followed unperceived by the king, reached a lake
outside the city. And he saw a woman lamenting in the midst of it;
&ldquo;Ah lord! Ah merciful one! Ah hero! How shall I exist abandoned
by thee?&rdquo; He asked her; &ldquo;Who are you, and what lord do you
lament?&rdquo; Then she said; &ldquo;My son, know that I am this earth.
At present Vikramatunga is my righteous lord, and his death will
certainly take place on the third day from now. And how shall I obtain
such a lord again? For with divine foresight I behold the good and evil
to come, as Suprabha, the son of a god, did, when in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

told him the cause of his grief. Then Indra said to him, &ldquo;Listen,
there is a way out of this difficulty open to you. Have recourse to
&#346;iva as a protector, exclaiming &lsquo;Om! Honour to
&#346;iva!&rsquo; If you resort to him as a protector, you shall escape
from your guilt and obtain merit, so that you shall not be born in the
body of a pig nor fall from heaven.&rdquo; When the king of the gods
said this to Suprabha, he followed his advice, and exclaiming
&ldquo;Om! Honour to &#346;iva!&rdquo; he fled to &#346;iva as an
asylum. After remaining wholly intent on him for six days, he not only
by his favour escaped being sent into the body of a pig, but went to an
abode of bliss higher than <i>Svarga</i>. And on the seventh day, when
Indra, not seeing him in heaven, looked about, he found he had gone to
another and a superior world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Suprabha lamented, beholding pollution impending, so I
lament, beholding the impending death of the king.&rdquo; When Earth
said this, V&iacute;ravara answered her:&mdash;&ldquo;If there is any
expedient for rescuing this king, as there was an expedient for
rescuing Suprabha in accordance with the advice of Indra, pray tell it
me.&rdquo; When Earth was thus addressed by V&iacute;ravara, she
answered him: &ldquo;There is an expedient in this case, and it is in
your hands.&rdquo; When the Br&aacute;hman V&iacute;ravara heard this,
he said joyfully&mdash;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11361src" href=
"#xd27e11361" name="xd27e11361src">10</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me, goddess, quickly; if my lord can be benefited
by the sacrifice of my life, or of my son or wife, my birth is not
wasted.&rdquo; When V&iacute;ravara said this, Earth answered
him&mdash;&ldquo;There is here an image of Durg&aacute; near the
palace; if you offer to that image your son Sattvavara, then the king
will live, but there is no other expedient for saving his life.&rdquo;
When the resolute V&iacute;ravara heard this speech of the goddess
Earth, he said&mdash;&ldquo;I will go, lady, and do it
immediately.&rdquo; And Earth said &ldquo;What other man is so devoted
to his lord? Go, and prosper.&rdquo; And the king, who followed him,
heard all.</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara went quickly to his house that night, and the
king followed him unobserved. There he woke up his wife
Dharmavat&iacute; and told her, that, by the counsel of the goddess
Earth, he must offer up his son for the sake of the king. She, when she
heard it, said&mdash;&ldquo;We must certainly do what is for the
advantage of the king; so wake up our son and tell him.&rdquo; Then
V&iacute;ravara woke up his son, and told him all that the goddess
Earth had told him, as being for the interest of the king, down to the
necessity of his own sacrifice<span class="corr" id="xd27e11377" title=
"Not in source">.</span> When the child Sattvavara heard this, he,
being rightly named, said to his father,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11380src" href="#xd27e11380" name="xd27e11380src">11</a>
&ldquo;Am I not fortunate, my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522"
href="#pb522" name="pb522">522</a>]</span>father, in that my life can
profit the king? I must requite him for his food which I have eaten; so
take me and sacrifice me to the goddess for his sake.&rdquo; When the
boy Sattvavara said this, V&iacute;ravara answered him undismayed,
&ldquo;In truth you are my own son.&rdquo; When king Vikramatunga, who
was standing outside, heard this, he said to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!
the members of this family are all equally brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara took that son Sattvavara on his shoulder, and
his wife Dharmavat&iacute; took his daughter V&iacute;ravat&iacute; on
her back, and the two went to the temple of Durg&aacute; by night.</p>
<p>And the king Vikramatunga followed them, carefully concealing
himself. When they reached the temple, Sattvavara was put down by his
father from his shoulder, and, though he was a boy, being a store-house
of courage, he bowed before the goddess, and addressed this petition to
her: &ldquo;Goddess, may our lord&rsquo;s life be saved by the offering
of my head! And may the king Vikramatunga rule the earth without an
enemy to oppose him!&rdquo; When the boy said this, V&iacute;ravara
exclaimed, &ldquo;Bravo! my son!&rdquo; And drawing his sword, he cut
off his son&rsquo;s head, and offered it to the goddess Durg&aacute;,
saying, &ldquo;May the king be prosperous!&rdquo; Those who are devoted
to their master grudge them neither their sons&rsquo; lives nor their
own. Then a voice was heard from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Bravo,
V&iacute;ravara! you have bestowed life on your master by sacrificing
even the life of your son.&rdquo; Then, while the king was seeing and
hearing with great astonishment all that went on, the daughter of
V&iacute;ravara, named V&iacute;ravat&iacute;, who was a mere girl,
came up to the head of her slain brother, and embraced it, and kissed
it, and crying out &ldquo;Alas! my brother!&rdquo; died of a broken
heart. When V&iacute;ravara&rsquo;s wife, Dharmavat&iacute;, saw that
her daughter also was dead, in her grief she clasped her hands
together, and said to V&iacute;ravara; &ldquo;We have now ensured the
prosperity of the king, so permit me to enter the fire with my two dead
children. Since my infant daughter, though too young to understand
anything, has died out of grief for her brother, what is the use of my
life, my two children being dead?&rdquo; When she spoke with this
settled purpose, V&iacute;ravara said to her; &ldquo;Do so, what can I
say against it? For, blameless one, there remains no happiness for you
in a world, which will be all filled for you with grief for your two
children; so wait a moment while I prepare the funeral pyre.&rdquo;
Having said this, he constructed a pyre with some wood, that was lying
there to make the fence of the enclosure of the goddess&rsquo;s temple,
and put the corpses of his children upon it, and lit a fire under it,
so that it was enveloped in flames. Then his virtuous wife,
Dharmavat&iacute;, fell at his feet, and exclaiming, &ldquo;May you, my
husband, be my lord in my next birth, and may prosperity befall the
king!&rdquo; she leapt into that burning pyre, with its hair of flame,
as gladly as into a cool lake. And king Vikramatunga, who was standing
by unperceived, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523"
name="pb523">523</a>]</span>remained fixed in thought as to how he
could possibly recompense them.</p>
<p>Then V&iacute;ravara, of resolute soul, reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I
have accomplished my duty to my master, for a divine voice was heard
audibly, and so I have requited him for the food which I have eaten,
but now that I have lost all the dear family I had to support,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11396src" href="#xd27e11396" name=
"xd27e11396src">12</a> it is not meet that I should live alone,
supporting myself only, so why should I not propitiate this goddess
Durg&aacute; by offering up myself?&rdquo; V&iacute;ravara, firm in
virtue, having formed this determination, first approached with a hymn
of praise that goddess Durg&aacute;, the granter of boons.
&ldquo;Honour to thee, O great goddess, that givest security to thy
votaries, rescue me plunged in the mire of the world, that appeal to
thee for protection. Thou art the principle of life in creatures, by
thee this world moves. In the beginning of creation &#346;iva beheld
thee self-produced, blazing and illuminating the world with brightness
hard to behold, like ten million orbs of fiery suddenly-produced infant
suns rising at once, filling the whole horizon with the circle of thy
arms, bearing a sword, a club, a bow, arrows and a spear. And thou wast
praised by that god &#346;iva in the following words&mdash;&lsquo;Hail
to thee Cha&#7751;&#7693;&iacute;, Ch&aacute;mu&#7751;&#7693;&aacute;,
Mangal&aacute;, Tripur&aacute;, Jay&aacute;,
Ek&aacute;nan&#347;&aacute;, &#346;iv&aacute;, Durg&aacute;,
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute;, Sarasvat&iacute;,
Bhadrak&aacute;l&iacute;, Mah&aacute;lakshm&iacute;, Siddh&aacute;,
slayer of Ruru. Thou art G&aacute;yatr&iacute;,
Mah&aacute;r&aacute;jn&iacute;, Revat&iacute;, and the dweller in the
Vindhya hills; thou art Um&aacute; and K&aacute;ty&aacute;yan&iacute;,
and the dweller in Kail&aacute;sa, the mountain of &#346;iva.&rsquo;
When Skandha, and <span class="corr" id="xd27e11405" title=
"Source: Vasish&#7789;ha">Vasish&#7789;a</span>, and Brahm&aacute;, and
the others heard thee praised, under these and other titles, by
&#346;iva well skilled in praising, they also praised thee. And by
praising thee, O adorable one, immortals, <i>&#7771;ishis</i>, and men
obtained, and do now obtain, boons above their desire. So be favourable
to me, O bestower of boons and do thou also receive this tribute of the
sacrifice of my body, and may prosperity befall my lord the
king!&rdquo; After saying this, he was preparing to cut off his own
head,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11411src" href="#xd27e11411" name=
"xd27e11411src">13</a> but a bodiless voice was heard at that moment
from the air, &ldquo;Do not act rashly, my son, for I am well-pleased
with this courage of thine, so crave from me the boon that thou dost
desire.&rdquo; When V&iacute;ravara heard that, he said, &ldquo;If thou
art pleased, goddess, then may king Vikramatunga live another hundred
years. And may my wife and children return to life.&rdquo; When he
craved this boon, there again sounded from the air the words &ldquo;So
be it!&rdquo; And immediately the three, Dharmavat&iacute;, Sattvavara,
and V&iacute;ravat&iacute; rose up with unwounded bodies. Then
V&iacute;ravara was delighted, and took home to his house all those who
had been thus restored to life by the favour of the goddess, and
returned to the king&rsquo;s gate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb524"
href="#pb524" name="pb524">524</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the king, having beheld all this with joy and astonishment, went
and again ascended the roof of his palace unobserved. And he cried out
from above&mdash;&ldquo;Who is on guard at the palace-gate?&rdquo; When
V&iacute;ravara, who was below, heard that, he answered&mdash;&ldquo;I
am here, and I went to discover that woman, but she vanished somewhere
as soon as I saw her, like a goddess.&rdquo; When king Vikramatunga
heard this, as he had seen the whole transaction, which was exceedingly
wonderful, he reflected with himself alone in the night: &ldquo;Oh!
surely this man is an unheard of marvel of heroism, to perform such an
exceedingly meritorious action, and not to give any account of it. The
sea, though deep, and broad, and full of great monsters,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11417src" href="#xd27e11417" name=
"xd27e11417src">14</a> does not vie with this man, who is firm even in
the shock of a mighty tempest. What return can I make to him, who
secretly redeemed my life this night by the sacrifice of his son and
wife?&rdquo; Thus reflecting, the king descended from the roof of the
palace, and went into his private apartments, and passed that night in
smiling. And in the morning, when V&iacute;ravara was present in the
great assembly, he related his wonderful exploit that night. Then all
praised that V&iacute;ravara, and the king conferred on him and his son
a turban of honour. And he gave him many domains, horses, jewels, and
elephants, and ten crores of gold pieces, and a salary sixty times as
great as before. And immediately the Br&aacute;hman V&iacute;ravara
became equal to a king, with a lofty umbrella, being prosperous,
himself and his family.</p>
<p>When the minister Gomukha had told this tale, he again said to
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, summing up the subject&mdash;&ldquo;Thus, king,
do sovereigns, by their merit in a previous life, sometimes fall in
with exceptionally heroic servants, who, in their nobility of soul,
abandoning regard for their lives and all other possessions for the
sake of their master, conquer completely the two worlds. And
Pralambab&aacute;hu, this lately arrived heroic Br&aacute;hman servant
of yours, my king, is seen to be such, of settled virtue and character,
a man in whom the quality of goodness is ever on the increase.&rdquo;
When the noble-minded prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this from his
minister, the mighty-minded Gomukha, he felt unsurpassed satisfaction
in his heart.</p>

<p class="first">Thus Narav&aacute;hanadatta dwelt in the house of his
father the king of Vatsa, being attended by his affectionate ministers,
Gomukha and the others, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525" href=
"#pb525" name="pb525">525</a>]</span>and amusing himself with his
loving queen Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, whose jealousy was removed by
her great love, that refused to be hampered by female pride. Then, once
on a time, he went to a forest of wild beasts, mounted on a chariot,
with Gomukha seated behind him. And, with that heroic Br&aacute;hman
Pralambab&aacute;hu going in front of him, he indulged in silvan
sports, accompanied by his attendants. And though the horses of his
chariot galloped at the utmost of their speed, Pralambab&aacute;hu
outstripped their swiftness, and still kept in front of them. The
prince from his position on the chariot killed lions, and tigers, and
other wild beasts with arrows, but Pralambab&aacute;hu, going on foot,
slew them with his sword. And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, as often as he
beheld that Br&aacute;hman, said in astonishment&mdash;<span class=
"corr" id="xd27e11432" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>What
courage, and what fleetness of foot he possesses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the prince, being wearied at the end of his hunting, and
overcome with thirst, went in search of water, mounted on his chariot,
with Gomukha and his charioteer, and preceded by that champion
Pralambab&aacute;hu, and in the course of his search he reached another
great forest far distant. There he came to a great and charming lake
with full-blown golden lotuses, looking like a second sky on earth,
studded with many solar orbs. There he bathed and drank water, and,
after he and his companions had performed their ablutions and other
duties, he beheld at one end of the lake, at a distance, four men of
heavenly appearance, dressed in heavenly garments, adorned with
heavenly ornaments, engaged in culling golden lotuses from that lake.
And out of curiosity he approached them, and when they asked him who he
was, he told them his descent, his name and his history.</p>
<p>And they, pleased at seeing him, told him their story when he asked
them; &ldquo;There is in the midst of the great sea a great, prosperous
and splendid island, which is called the island of N&aacute;rikela, and
is renowned in the world for its beauty.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11439src" href="#xd27e11439" name="xd27e11439src">1</a> And in it
there are four mountains with splendid expanses of land, named
Main&aacute;ka, V&#7771;ishabha, Chakra, and Bal&aacute;haka, in those
four we four live. One of us is named R&uacute;pasiddhi, and he
possesses the power of assuming various forms; another is by name
Pram&aacute;nasiddhi, who can measure the most minute as well as the
largest things; and the third is Jn&aacute;nasiddhi, who knows the
past, the present, and the future; and the fourth is Devasiddhi, who
possesses the power of calling down to his aid all the deities. We have
now gathered these golden lotuses, and are going to offer them to the
god, the husband of &#346;r&iacute;, in &#346;vetadv&iacute;pa. For we
are all of us devoted to him, and it is by his favour that we possess
rule over those mountains of ours, and prosperity accompanied with
supernatural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526" href="#pb526" name=
"pb526">526</a>]</span>power. So come, we will shew you the lord Hari
in &#346;vetadv&iacute;pa; we will carry you through the air, friend,
if you approve.&rdquo; When those sons of gods said this,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta consented, and leaving Gomukha and the others in
that place, where they could obtain water, fruits and so on, he went
with them to &#346;vetadv&iacute;pa through the air, for Devasiddhi,
one of the four brothers, carried him in his lap. There he descended
from heaven, and beheld Vish&#7751;u, and approached him from a
distance, introduced by those four sons of gods. The god was reclining
upon the snake &#346;esha, in front of him sat Garu&#7693;a, at his
side was the daughter of the sea,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11452src"
href="#xd27e11452" name="xd27e11452src">2</a> at his feet was the
Earth, he was waited upon by the discus, the conch, the club, and the
lotus, incarnate in bodily form, and the Gandharvas, with N&aacute;rada
at their head, were piously chanting hymns in his honour, and the gods,
Siddhas, and Vidy&aacute;dharas were bowing before him. To whom is not
association with the good a cause of exaltation?</p>
<p>Then, after that Lord had been honoured by those sons of gods, and
praised by Ka&#347;yapa and others, Narav&aacute;hanadatta thus praised
him with folded hands, &ldquo;All hail to thee, venerable one, the
wishing-tree of thy worshippers, whose body is encircled with the
wish-granting creeper of Lakshm&iacute;, who art the granter of all
desires; hail to thee, the divine swan, dwelling in the
M&aacute;nasa-lake of the minds of the good,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11459src" href="#xd27e11459" name="xd27e11459src">3</a> ever
soaring and singing in the highest ether. Hail to thee, who dost
transcend all, and dwell within all, who hast a form transcending
qualities, and whose shape is the full aggregate of the six kingly
measures;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11467src" href="#xd27e11467" name=
"xd27e11467src">4</a> Brahm&aacute; is the bee on the lotus of thy
navel, O Lord, humming with the soft sound of Veda-murmur, though from
him spring many verses;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11470src" href=
"#xd27e11470" name="xd27e11470src">5</a> thy foot is the earth, the
heaven is thy head, the cardinal points are thy ears, the sun and moon
are thy eyes; thy belly is the egg of Brahm&aacute;, the globe of the
world; thou art hymned by the wise as the infinite soul. From thee, the
home of brightness, spring all these creatures, O Lord, as the host of
sparks from the blazing fire, and when the time of destruction comes,
they again enter thy essence, as at the end of the day a flock of birds
enters the great tree in which they dwell. Thou flashest forth, and
createst these lords of the world, who are parts of thee, as the ocean,
disturbed with a continual flow, creates waves. Though the world is thy
form, thou art formless; though the world is thy handiwork, thou art
free from the bondage of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb527" href=
"#pb527" name="pb527">527</a>]</span>works; though thou art the support
of the world, thou art thyself without support; who is he that knows
thy real nature? The gods have obtained various stages of prosperity by
being looked upon by thee with a favourable eye; so be propitious, and
look upon me, thy suppliant, with an eye melting with love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta had in these words praised Vish&#7751;u,
the god looked upon him with a favourable eye, and said to
N&aacute;rada: &ldquo;Go and demand back from Indra in my name those
lovely Apsarases of mine, who long ago sprang from the sea of milk, and
whom I deposited in his hand, and make them mount the chariot of Indra,
and quickly bring them here.&rdquo; When N&aacute;rada received this
command from Hari, he said &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and with
M&aacute;tali he brought the Apsarases from Indra in his chariot, and
then bowing he presented the Apsarases to Vish&#7751;u, and the Holy
one spake thus to the son of the king of
Vatsa&mdash;&ldquo;Narav&aacute;hanadatta, I give these Apsarases to
thee, the future emperor of the kings of the Vidy&aacute;dharas. Thou
art a fitting husband for them, and they are fitting wives for thee,
for thou hast been created by &#346;iva as an incarnation of the god of
Love.&rdquo; When Vish&#7751;u said that, the son of the king of Vatsa
fell at his feet, delighted at having obtained favour, and Vish&#7751;u
thus commanded M&aacute;tali,&mdash;&ldquo;Let this
Narav&aacute;hanadatta, together with the Apsarases, be taken back by
thee to his palace, by whatever path he desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Holy one gave this command, Narav&aacute;hanadatta, with
the Apsarases and those sons of gods who invited him, mounted the
chariot which was driven by M&aacute;tali, and went to the island of
N&aacute;rikela, being envied even by gods. There the successful hero,
honoured by those four sons of gods, R&uacute;pasiddhi and his
brethren, and accompanied by Indra&rsquo;s chariot, sported in
succession on those four mountains on which they dwelt, Main&aacute;ka,
V&#7771;ishabha, and the others, that vied with heaven, in the company
of those Apsarases. And he roamed, full of joy, in the thickets of
their pleasure-grounds, the various splendid trees of which were in
blossom on account of the arrival of the month of spring. And those
sons of gods said to him: &ldquo;See! these clusters on the trees seem
to be regarding with the expanded eyes of their open flowers their
beloved spring that has arrived. See! the full-blown lotuses shield the
lake, as if to prevent their place of birth from being afflicted by the
warmth of the sun&rsquo;s rays. See! the bees, after resorting to a
Karnik&aacute;ra splendid with blossoms, leave it again, finding it
destitute of perfume, as good men leave a rich man of mean character.
See! a concert is being held in honour of spring, the king of the
seasons, with the songs of the Kinnar&iacute;s, the notes of the
cuckoos, and the humming of bees.&rdquo; With such words those sons of
gods shewed Narav&aacute;hanadatta the range of their pleasure-grounds.
And the son of the king of Vatsa amused himself also in their cities,
beholding the merry-makings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528" href=
"#pb528" name="pb528">528</a>]</span>of the citizens, who danced
without restraint in honour of the spring-festival. And he enjoyed with
the Apsarases delights fitted for gods; wherever the virtuous go, their
good fortunes precede them.</p>
<p>After remaining there for four days thus occupied,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta said to those sons of gods his friends; &ldquo;I
now wish to go to my own city, being anxious to behold my
father;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11489src" href="#xd27e11489" name=
"xd27e11489src">6</a> so come you also to that city and bless it with a
visit.&rdquo; When they heard that, they said: &ldquo;We have seen you,
the choicest jewel in that town; what more do we require? But when you
have obtained the sciences of the Vidy&aacute;dharas, you must not
forget us.&rdquo; With these words they dismissed him, and
Narav&aacute;hanadatta said to M&aacute;tali, who brought him the
splendid chariot of Indra; &ldquo;Take me to the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; by a course leading past that lovely lake,
on the bank of which I left Gomukha and the others.&rdquo;
M&aacute;tali consented, and the prince ascended the chariot with the
Apsarases, and reached that lake, and saw Gomukha and the others, and
said to them, &ldquo;Come quickly by your own way, I will tell you all
when I get home.&rdquo; Having said this, he went to
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute; in the chariot of Indra. There he descended
from heaven, and dismissed M&aacute;tali after honouring him, and
entered his own palace accompanied by those Apsarases. And leaving them
there, he went and prostrated himself before the feet of his father,
who was delighted at his arrival, and also of V&aacute;savadatt&aacute;
and Padm&aacute;vat&iacute;, and they welcomed him, and their eyes were
never satisfied with gazing on him. And in the meanwhile Gomukha came,
riding on the chariot, with the charioteer, and that Br&aacute;hman
Pralambab&aacute;hu. Then, being questioned by his father,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta related in the presence of all his ministers his
very wonderful adventures. And all said&mdash;&ldquo;God grants to that
virtuous man, whom he wishes to favour, association with good
friends.&rdquo; When all said this, the king was pleased, and ordered a
festival for his son on account of the favour which Vish&#7751;u had
shewed towards him. And he and his wives saw those Apsarases his
daughters-in-law, obtained by the favour of Vish&#7751;u, whom Gomukha
brought to fall at his feet, Devarup&aacute;, and Devarati, and
Devam&aacute;l&aacute;, and the fourth Devapriy&aacute;, whose names he
enquired by the mouth of their maids. And the city of
Kau&#347;&aacute;mb&iacute;, making festival, appeared as if scattering
red paint with its waving scarlet banners, as much as to say:
&ldquo;What am I that Apsarases should dwell in me? Blessed am I that
the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta has made me a heavenly city upon
earth.&rdquo; And Narav&aacute;hanadatta, after he had rejoiced the
eyes of his father, visited his other wives, who were anxiously
awaiting him, and they, who had been emaciated by those four days, as
if they were four years, exulted, relating the various woes of their
separation. And Gomukha described the valour of Pralambab&aacute;hu,
while he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=
"pb529">529</a>]</span>was protecting the horses during their sojourn
in the forest, in killing lions and other noxious beasts. Thus
listening to pleasing unrestrained conversation, and contemplating the
beauty of his beloved ones, that was as nectar to his eyes, and making
flattering speeches, and drinking wine in the company of his ministers,
Narav&aacute;hanadatta passed that time there in happiness.</p>
<p>Once on a time, as he was in the apartments of
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute; with his ministers, he heard a loud sound of
drums outside. Then he said to his general Hari&#347;ikha: &ldquo;What
may be the cause of this sudden great noise of drums outside?&rdquo;
When Hari&#347;ikha heard this, he went out, and entering again
immediately said to the prince, the son of the king of Vatsa;
&ldquo;There is in this town a merchant of the name of Rudra, and he
went to the island of Suvar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa on a mercantile
expedition. As he was returning, the hoard of wealth, that he had
managed to acquire, was lost, being sunk in the sea by his ship
foundering. And he himself happened to escape from the sea alive. And
to-day is the sixth day since he arrived in misery at his own house.
After he had been living here for some days in distress, it happened
that he found a great treasure in his garden. And the king of Vatsa
heard of it from his relations, so the merchant came to-day and
represented the matter to the king; saying&mdash;&lsquo;I have obtained
four crores of gold pieces with a multitude of valuable jewels, so, if
the king commands me, I will hand them over.&rsquo; The king of Vatsa
thereupon gave this command to the merchant&mdash;&lsquo;Who that had
any sense,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11498src" href="#xd27e11498"
name="xd27e11498src">7</a> after seeing you in distress, plundered by
the sea, would plunder you again, now that you have been supplied with
wealth by the mercy of Providence. Go and enjoy at will the wealth
obtained from your own ground.&rsquo; The merchant fell at the
king&rsquo;s feet full of joy, and it is this very man that is now
returning to his house, with his attendants beating drums.&rdquo; When
Hari&#347;ikha said this, Narav&aacute;hanadatta praised the justice of
his father, and said in astonishment to his ministers&mdash;&ldquo;If
Destiny sometimes takes away wealth, does she not sometimes afterwards
give it. She sports in a strange way with the raising and depressing of
men.&rdquo; When Gomukha heard that, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Such is the
course of Destiny! And in proof of this, hear the story of
Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the merchant Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old times there was a splendid city, belonging to
the king Harshavarman, called Harshapura, the citizens of which were
made happy by good government. In this city there was a great merchant,
named Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra; he was of good family, just, of resolute
courage, a lord of much wealth. He was once compelled by his business
to go to <span class="corr" id="xd27e11506" title=
"Source: Suvarnadv&iacute;pa">Suvar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa</span>, and
reaching the shore of the sea, he embarked on a ship. As he was
travelling over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href="#pb530"
name="pb530">530</a>]</span>sea, when his journey was very nearly at an
end, a terrible cloud arose and a wind that agitated the deep. The wind
tossed the ship about with the violence of the waves, and it was struck
by a sea-monster and split asunder; and then the merchant, girding up
his loins, plunged into the sea. And after the brave man had made some
way by swimming, he found the corpse of a man long dead, driven hither
and thither by the wind. And he climbed up on the corpse, and skilfully
paddling himself along with his arms, he was carried to <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e11511" title=
"Source: Suvarnadv&iacute;pa">Suvar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa</span> by a
favourable wind. There he got off that corpse on to the sand, and he
perceived that it had a cloth tied round its loins, with a knot in it.
When he unfastened the cloth from its loins, and examined it, he found
inside it a necklace richly studded with jewels. He saw that it was of
inestimable value, and he bathed and remained in a state of great
felicity, thinking that the wealth he had lost in the sea was but straw
in comparison with it. Then he went on to a city called
Kala&#347;apura, and with the bracelet in his hand, entered the
enclosure of a great temple. There he sat in the shade, and being
exceedingly tired with his exertions in the water, he slowly dropped
off to sleep, bewildered by Destiny. And while he was asleep, the
policemen came and saw that necklace in his hand exposed to view. They
said&mdash;&ldquo;Here is the necklace stolen from the neck of the
princess Chakrasen&aacute;; without doubt this is the thief.&rdquo; And
so they woke the merchant up and took him to the palace. There the king
himself questioned him, and he told him what had taken place. The king
held out the necklace, and said to the people present in
court,&mdash;&ldquo;This man is speaking falsely; he is a thief, look
at this necklace.&rdquo; And at that very moment a kite saw it
glittering, and quickly swooping down from heaven, carried off the
necklace, and disappeared where he could not be traced. Then the king,
in his anger, commanded that the merchant should be put to death, and
he, in great grief, invoked the protection of &#346;iva. Then a voice
was heard from heaven&mdash;&ldquo;Do not put this man to death: he is
a respectable merchant named Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra from the city of
Harshapura, that has landed on your territory. The thief, who stole the
necklace, fled, beside himself with fear of the police, and falling
into the sea at night, perished. But this merchant here, when his ship
foundered, came upon the body of that thief, and climbing up on it, he
crossed the sea and came here. And then he found the necklace in the
knot of the cloth fastened round his loins; he did not take it from
your house. So let go, king, this virtuous merchant, who is not a
thief; dismiss him with honour.&rdquo; Having said this, the voice
ceased. When the king heard this, he was satisfied, and revoking the
capital sentence passed on the merchant, he honoured him with wealth,
and let him go. And the merchant, having obtained wealth, bought wares,
and again crossed the terrible ocean in a ship, in order to return to
his own native land. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb531" href="#pb531"
name="pb531">531</a>]</span></p>
<p>And after he had crossed the sea, he travelled with a caravan, and
one day, at evening time, he reached a wood. The caravan encamped in
the wood for the night, and while Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra was awake, a
powerful host of bandits attacked it. While the bandits were massacring
the members of the caravan, Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra left his wares and
fled, and climbed up a banyan-tree without being discovered. The host
of bandits departed, after they had carried off all the wealth, and the
merchant spent that night there, perplexed with fear, and distracted
with grief. In the morning he cast his eye towards the top of the tree,
and saw, as fate would have it, what looked like the light of a lamp,
trembling among the leaves. And in his astonishment he climbed up the
tree, and saw a kite&rsquo;s nest, in which there was a heap of
glittering priceless jewelled ornaments. He took them all out of it,
and found among the ornaments that necklace, which he had found in
Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa and the kite had carried off. He obtained from
that nest unlimited wealth, and, descending from the tree, he went off
delighted, and reached in course of time his own city of Harshapura.
There the merchant Samudra&#347;&uacute;ra remained, enjoying himself
to his heart&rsquo;s content with his family, free from the desire of
any other wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have that merchant&rsquo;s whelming in the sea, and
that loss of his wealth, and the finding of the necklace, and again the
losing of it, and his undeserved degradation to the position of a
malefactor, and his immediate obtaining of wealth from the satisfied
king, and his return-voyage over the sea, and his being stripped of all
his wealth by falling in with bandits on the journey, and at last his
acquisition of wealth from the top of a tree. So you see, prince, such
is the various working of destiny, but a virtuous man, though he may
have endured sorrow, obtains joy at the last.&rdquo; When
Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this from Gomukha, he approved it, and
rising up, he performed his daily duties, such as bathing and the
like.</p>
<p>And the next day, when he was in the hall of assembly, the heroic
prince Samaratunga, who had been his servant ever since he was a boy,
came and said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Prince, my relation
Sangr&aacute;marvarsha has ravaged my territory, with the help of his
four sons, V&iacute;rajita and the others. So I will go myself, and
bring them all five here as prisoners. Let my lord know this.&rdquo;
After saying this he departed. And the son of the king of Vatsa,
knowing that he had but a small force, and that those others had large
forces, ordered his own army to follow him. But that proud man refused
to receive this accession to his force, and went and conquered those
five enemies in fight by the help of his own two arms only, and brought
them back prisoners. Narav&aacute;hanadatta honoured and praised his
follower, when he came back victorious, and said&mdash;&ldquo;How
wonderful! This man has conquered his five enemies, though with their
forces they had overrun his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb532" href=
"#pb532" name="pb532">532</a>]</span>territory, and has done the deed
of a hero, as a man conquers the senses, when they have laid hold upon
outward objects, and are powerful, and so accomplishes emancipation,
the work of the soul.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11523src" href=
"#xd27e11523" name="xd27e11523src">8</a> When Gomukha heard that, he
said&mdash;&ldquo;If, prince, you have not heard the tale of king
Chamarab&aacute;la, which is similar, listen, I will tell
it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a city named Hastin&aacute;pura, and in it
there lived a king named Chamarab&aacute;la, who possessed treasure, a
fort, and an army. And he had, as neighbours to his territory, several
kings of the same family as himself, the chief of whom was
Samarab&aacute;la, and they put their heads together and reflected:
&ldquo;This king Chamarab&aacute;la defeats us all, one by one; so we
will join together and accomplish his overthrow.&rdquo; After thus
deliberating, those five kings&rsquo; being anxious to march out
against him to conquer him, secretly asked an astrologer when a
favourable moment would come. The astrologer, not seeing a favourable
moment, and not seeing good omens, said&mdash;&ldquo;There is no
favourable moment for you this year. Under whatever circumstances you
set out on your expedition, you will not be victorious. And why are you
so eager for the undertaking, beholding his prosperity? Enjoyment is
after all the fruit<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11531src" href=
"#xd27e11531" name="xd27e11531src">9</a> of prosperity, and you have
enjoyments in abundance. And now hear, if you have not heard it before,

<h3 class="main">Story of Ya&#347;ovarman and the two fortunes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in old time in this country a city, named
Kautukapura. In it there lived a king, called
Bahusuvar&#7751;aka,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11546src" href=
"#xd27e11546" name="xd27e11546src">10</a> rightly named. And he had a
young Kshatriya servant named Ya&#347;ovarman. To that man the king
never gave anything, though he was generous by nature. Whenever in his
distress he asked the king, the king said to him, pointing to the sun,
&ldquo;I wish to give to you, but this holy god will not permit me to
give to you. Tell me what I am to do.&rdquo; While he remained
distressed, watching for an opportunity, the time for an eclipse of the
sun arrived. Then Ya&#347;ovarman, who had constantly served the king,
went and said to him, when he was engaged in giving many valuable
presents: &ldquo;Give me something, my sovereign, while this sun, who
will not permit you to give, is in the grasp of his enemy.&rdquo; When
the king, who had given many presents, heard that, he laughed, and gave
garments, gold, and other things to him.</p>
<p>In course of time that wealth was consumed, and he, being afflicted,
as the king gave him nothing, and having lost his wife, went to the
shrine of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb533" href="#pb533" name=
"pb533">533</a>]</span>the goddess that dwells in the Vindhya
hills.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11555src" href="#xd27e11555" name=
"xd27e11555src">11</a> He said&mdash;&ldquo;What is the use of this
profitless body that is dead even while alive? I will abandon it before
the shrine of the goddess, or gain the desired boon.&rdquo; Resolved on
this course, he lay down on a bed of <i>darbha</i> grass in front of
the goddess, with his mind intent on her, and fasting he performed a
severe penance. And the goddess said to him in a dream, &ldquo;I am
pleased with thee, my son; tell me, shall I give thee the good fortune
of wealth, or the good fortune of enjoyment?&rdquo; When
Ya&#347;ovarman heard this, he answered the goddess, &ldquo;I do not
precisely know the difference between these two good fortunes.&rdquo;
Then the goddess said to him: &ldquo;Return to thy own country, and
there go and examine into the good fortunes of the two merchants,
Arthavarman and Bhogavarman, and find out which of the two pleases
thee, and then come here and ask a like fortune for thyself.&rdquo;
When Ya&#347;ovarman heard this, he woke up, and next morning he broke
his fast, and went to his own country of Kautukapura.</p>
<p>There he first went to the house of Arthavarman,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11577src" href="#xd27e11577" name="xd27e11577src">12</a> who
had acquired much wealth, in the form of gold, jewels, and other
precious things, by his business transactions. Seeing that prosperity
of his, he approached him with due politeness, and was welcomed by him,
and invited to dinner. Then he sat by the side of that Arthavarman, and
ate food appropriate to a guest, with meat-curry and ghee. But
Arthavarman ate barley-meal, with half a <i>pal</i> of ghee and a
little rice, and a small quantity of meat-curry. Ya&#347;ovarman said
to the merchant out of curiosity&mdash;&ldquo;Great merchant, why do
you eat so little?&rdquo; Thereupon the merchant gave him this answer:
&ldquo;To-day out of regard for you I have eaten a little rice with
meat-curry and half a <i>pal</i> of ghee; I have also eaten some
barley-meal. But as a general rule, I eat only a <i>karsha</i> of ghee
and some barley-meal, I have a weak digestion, and cannot digest more
in my stomach.&rdquo; When Ya&#347;ovarman heard that, he turned the
matter over in his mind, and formed an unfavourable opinion of that
prosperity of Arthavarman&rsquo;s, as being without fruit. Then, at
nightfall, that merchant Arthavarman again brought rice and milk for
Ya&#347;ovarman to eat. And Ya&#347;ovarman again ate of it to his
fill, and then Arthavarman drank one <i>pala</i> of milk. And in that
same place Ya&#347;ovarman and Arthavarman both made their beds, and
gradually fell asleep.</p>
<p>And at midnight Ya&#347;ovarman suddenly saw in his sleep some men
of terrible appearance with clubs in their hands, entering the room.
And they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534" name=
"pb534">534</a>]</span>exclaimed angrily&mdash;&ldquo;Fie! why have you
taken to-day one <i>karsha</i> more of ghee than the small amount
allowed to you, and eaten meat-curry, and drunk a <i>pala</i> of
milk?&rdquo; Then they dragged Arthavarman by his foot and beat him
with clubs. And they extracted from his stomach the <i>karsha</i> of
ghee, and the milk, flesh, and rice, which he had consumed above his
allowance. When Ya&#347;ovarman had seen that, he woke up and looked
about him, and lo! Arthavarman had woke up, and was seized with colic.
Then Arthavarman, crying out, and having his stomach rubbed by his
servants, vomited up all the food he had eaten above the proper
allowance. After the merchant&rsquo;s colic was allayed,
Ya&#347;ovarman said to himself: &ldquo;Away with this good fortune of
wealth, which involves enjoyment of such an equivocal kind! This would
be altogether neutralized by such misery of ill health.&rdquo; In such
internal reflections he passed that night.</p>
<p>And in the morning he took leave of Arthavarman, and went to the
house of that merchant Bhogavarman. There he approached him in due
form, and he received him with politeness, and invited him to dine with
him on that day. Now he did not perceive any wealth in the possession
of that merchant, but he saw that he had a nice house, and dresses, and
ornaments. While Ya&#347;ovarman was waiting there, the merchant
Bhogavarman proceeded to do his own special business. He took
merchandise from one man, and immediately handed it over to another,
and without any capital of his own, gained <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>
by the transaction. And he quickly sent those
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> by the hand of his servant to his wife, in
order that she might procure all kinds of food and drink. And
immediately one of that merchant&rsquo;s <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11613" title="Source: friend&rsquo;s">friends</span>, named
Ichchh&aacute;bhara&#7751;a, rushed in and said to him: &ldquo;Our
dinner is ready, rise up and come to us, and let us eat, for all our
other friends have assembled and are waiting for you.&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;I shall not come to-day, for I have a guest
here.&rdquo; Thereupon his friend went on to say to him, &ldquo;Then
let this guest come with you; is he not our friend also? Rise up
quickly.&rdquo; Bhogavarman, being thus earnestly invited by that
friend, went with him, accompanied by Ya&#347;ovarman, and ate
excellent food. And, after drinking wine, he returned, and again
enjoyed all kinds of viands and wines at his own house in the evening.
And when night came on, he asked his servants&mdash;&ldquo;Have we
enough wine left for the latter part of the night or not?&rdquo; When
they replied, &ldquo;No, master,&rdquo; the merchant went to bed,
exclaiming, &ldquo;How are we to drink water in the latter part of the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ya&#347;ovarman, sleeping at his side, saw in a dream two or
three men enter, and some others behind them. And those who entered
last, having sticks in their hands, exclaimed angrily to those who
entered first&mdash;&ldquo;You rascals! Why did you not provide wine
for Bhogavarman to drink in the latter half of the night? Where have
you been all this time?&rdquo; Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb535" href="#pb535" name="pb535">535</a>]</span>they beat them with
strokes of their sticks. The men who were beaten with sticks, said,
&ldquo;Pardon this single fault on our part.&rdquo; And then they and
the others went out of the room.</p>
<p>Then Ya&#347;ovarman, having seen that sight, woke up and reflected,
&ldquo;The good fortune of enjoyment of Bhogavarman, in which blessings
arrive unthought of, is preferable to the good fortune of wealth of
Arthavarman, which, though attended with opulence, is devoid of
enjoyment.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>In these reflections he spent the rest of the night.</p>
<p>And early the next morning Ya&#347;ovarman took leave of that
excellent merchant, and again repaired to the feet of Durg&aacute;, the
goddess that dwells in the Vindhya range. And he chose out of those two
good fortunes mentioned by the goddess, when she appeared to him on a
former occasion,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11629src" href=
"#xd27e11629" name="xd27e11629src">13</a> while he was engaged in
austerities, the good fortune of enjoyment, and the goddess granted it
to him. Then Ya&#347;ovarman returned home and lived in happiness,
thanks to the good fortune of enjoyment, which, owing to the favour of
the goddess, continually presented itself to him unthought of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So a smaller fortune, accompanied with enjoyment, is to be
preferred to a great fortune, which, though great, is devoid of
enjoyment and therefore useless. So why are you annoyed at the good
fortune of king Chamarab&aacute;la, which is combined with meanness,
and do not consider your own fortune, which is rich in the power of
giving and in enjoyment?</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd27e11639" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>So an attack on him by you is not
advisable, and there is no auspicious moment for commencing the
expedition, and I do not foresee victory to you.&rdquo; Though those
five kings were thus warned by the astrologer, they marched in their
impatience against king Chamarab&aacute;la.</p>
<p>And when king Chamarab&aacute;la heard that they had reached the
border, he bathed in the morning, and worshipped &#346;iva duly by his
auspicious names referring to sixty-eight excellent parts of the

desires. And then he heard a voice coming from heaven, &ldquo;King,
fight without fear, thou shalt conquer thy enemies in battle.&rdquo;
Then king Chamarab&aacute;la was delighted, and girded on his armour,
and accompanied by his army, marched out to fight with those foes. In
the army of his enemies there were thirty thousand elephants, and three
hundred thousand horses, and ten million foot-soldiers. And in his own
army there were twenty hundred thousand foot-soldiers, and ten thousand
elephants, and a hundred thousand horses. Then a great battle took
place between those two armies, and king Chamarab&aacute;la, preceded
by his warder V&iacute;ra,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11649src" href=
"#xd27e11649" name="xd27e11649src">15</a> who was rightly so named,
entered that field of battle, as the holy Vish&#7751;u, in the form of
the great boar, entered the great ocean. And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb536" href="#pb536" name=
"pb536">536</a>]</span>though he had but a small army, he so grievously
smote that great army of his foes, that slain horses, elephants, and
footmen lay in heaps. And when king Samarab&aacute;la came across him
in the battle, he rushed upon him, and smote him with an iron spear,
and drawing him towards him with a lasso, made him prisoner. And then
in the same way he smote the second king Samara&#347;&uacute;ra in the
heart with an arrow, and drawing him towards him with a noose, made him
also prisoner. And his warder, named V&iacute;ra, captured the third
king, named Samarajita, and brought him to him. And his general, named
Devabala, brought and presented to him the fourth king, named
Prat&aacute;pachandra, wounded with an arrow. Then the fifth king
Prat&aacute;pasena, beholding that, fell furiously upon king
Chamarab&aacute;la in the fight. But he repelled his arrows with the
multitude of his own, and pierced him with three arrows in the
forehead. And when he was bewildered with the blows of the arrows,
Chamarab&aacute;la, like a second Destiny, flung a noose round his
neck, and dragging him along made him a captive. When those five kings
had in this way been taken prisoners in succession, as many of their
soldiers, as had escaped slaughter, fled, dispersing themselves in
every direction. And king Chamarab&aacute;la captured an infinite mass
of gold and jewels, and many wives belonging to those kings. And among
them, the head queen of king Prat&aacute;pasena, called
Ya&#347;olekh&aacute;, a lovely woman, fell into his hands.</p>
<p>Then he entered his city, and gave turbans of honour to the warder
V&iacute;ra and the general Devabala, and loaded them with jewels. And
the king made Ya&#347;olekh&aacute; an inmate of his own harem, on the
ground that she, being the wife of Prat&aacute;pasena, was captured
according to the custom of the Kshatriyas. And she, though flighty,
submitted to him because he had won her by the might of his arm; in
those abandoned to the intoxication of love the impressions of virtue
are evanescent. And after some days, king Chamarab&aacute;la, being
solicited by the queen Ya&#347;olekh&aacute;, let go those five captive
kings, Prat&aacute;pasena and the others, after they had learnt
submission and done homage, and after honouring them, dismissed them to
their own kingdoms. And then king Chamarab&aacute;la long ruled his own
wealthy kingdom, in which there were no opponents, and the enemies of
which had been conquered, and he sported with that
Ya&#347;olekh&aacute;, who surpassed in form and loveliness beautiful
Apsarases, being, as it were, the banner that announced his victory
over his foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus a brave man, though unsupported, conquers in the front
of battle even many enemies coming against him in fight, distracted
with hate, and not considering the resources of themselves and their
foe, and by his surpassing bravery puts a stop to the fever of their
conceit and pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Narav&aacute;hanadatta had heard this instructive tale told by
Gomukha, he praised it, and set about his daily duties of bathing and
so on. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb537" href="#pb537" name=
"pb537">537</a>]</span>And he spent that night, which was devoted to
the amusement of a concert, in singing with his wives in such a
ravishing way, that Sarasvat&iacute; from her seat in heaven gave him
and his beloved ones high commendation.</p>

<p class="first">Then, the next day, as Narav&aacute;hanadatta was
sitting in the apartments of Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, a servant of
Marubh&uacute;ti&rsquo;s, the brother of Sauvidalla the guard of the
prince&rsquo;s harem, came and said to him in the presence of all his
ministers&mdash;&ldquo;King, I have attended on Marubh&uacute;ti for
two years; he has given food and clothing to me and my wife: but he
will not give me the fifty <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> a year, which he
promised me in addition. And when I asked him for it, he gave me a
kick. So I am sitting in <i>dharna</i> against him at your
Highness&rsquo;s door. If your Highness does not give judgment in this
case, I shall enter the fire. What more can I say? For you are my
sovereign.&rdquo; When he had said this, he stopped, and
Marubh&uacute;ti said&mdash;&ldquo;I must give him the
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i>, but I have not got the money at
present.&rdquo; When he said this, all the ministers laughed at him,
and Narav&aacute;hanadatta said to the minister Marubh&uacute;ti:
&ldquo;What are you thinking about, you fool? Your intentions are not
over-creditable. Rise up, give him the hundred
<i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> without delay.&rdquo; When Marubh&uacute;ti
heard this speech of his sovereign&rsquo;s, he was ashamed, and
immediately brought that hundred <i>d&iacute;n&aacute;rs</i> and gave
it to him. Then Gomukha said&mdash;&ldquo;Marubh&uacute;ti is not to be
blamed, because the works of the Creator&rsquo;s hand have varying
moods of mind. Have you not heard the story of king
Chirad&aacute;t&#7771;i, and his servant named Prasanga?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Chirad&aacute;t&#7771;i.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In old time there was a king named
Chirad&aacute;t&#7771;i, sovereign or Chirapura. Though he was an
excellent man, his followers were extremely wicked. And that king had a
servant, named Prasanga, who had come from another country, and was
accompanied by two friends. And five years passed, while he was
performing his duties, but the king gave him nothing, not even when an
occasion was presented by a feast or something of the kind. And owing
to the wickedness of the courtiers, he never obtained an opportunity of
representing his case to the king, though his friends were continually
instigating him to do so.</p>
<p>Now one day the king&rsquo;s infant son died, and when he was
grieved at it, all his servants came and crowded round him. And among
them the servant, named Prasanga, out of pure sorrow, said to the king
as follows, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name=
"pb538">538</a>]</span>though his two friends tried to prevent him,
&ldquo;We have been your servants, your Highness, for a long time, and
you have never given us anything, nevertheless we have remained here
because we had hopes from your son; for we thought that, although you
have never given us anything, your son would certainly give us
something. If Fate has carried him off, what is the use of remaining
here now? We will immediately take our departure.&rdquo; Thus he
exclaimed, and fell at the feet of the king, and went out with his two
friends. The king reflected&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! though these men had fixed
their hopes on my son, they have been faithful servants to me, so I
must not abandon them.&rdquo; Thereupon he immediately had Prasanga and
his companions summoned, and loaded them so with wealth that poverty
did not again lay hold on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, men have various dispositions, for that king did
not give at the proper season, but did give in the unseasonable hour of
calamity.&rdquo; When Gomukha, skilful in story-telling, had said this,
he went on, at the instigation of the son of the sovereign of Vatsa, to
tell the following tale:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Story of king Kanakavarsha and
Madanasundar&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was in old time on the banks of the Ganges an
excellent city, named Kanakapura, the people of which were purified in
the water of the river; and which was a delightful place on account of
its good government. In this city the only imprisonment seen was the
committing to paper of the words of poets, the only kind of defeat was
the curling in the locks of the women, the only contest was the
struggle of getting the corn into the granary.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11698src" href="#xd27e11698" name="xd27e11698src">1</a></p>
<p>In that city there dwelt in old time a glorious king, named
Kanakavarsha, who was born to Priyadar&#347;ana, the son of
V&aacute;suki, king of the snakes, by the princess
Ya&#347;odhar&aacute;. Though he bore the weight of the whole earth, he
was adorned with innumerable virtues, he longed for glory, not for
wealth, he feared sin, not his enemy. He was dull in slandering his
neighbour, but not in the holy treatises; there was restraint in the
high-souled hero&rsquo;s wrath, not in his favour; he was
resolute-minded; he was niggardly in curses, not in gifts; he ruled the
whole world; and such was his extraordinary beauty that all women, the
moment they saw him, were distracted with the pain of love.</p>
<p>Once on a time, in an autumn, that was characterized by heat, that
maddened elephants, that was attended by flocks of swans, and delighted
the subjects with rejoicings,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11705src"
href="#xd27e11705" name="xd27e11705src">2</a> he entered a
picture-palace which was cooled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb539"
href="#pb539" name="pb539">539</a>]</span>by winds that blew laden with
the scent of lotuses. There he observed and praised the display of
pictures, and in the meanwhile there entered the warder, who said to
the king&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your majesty, an unequalled painter has arrived here from
Ujjayin&iacute;, boasting himself to be matchless in the art of
painting. His name is Roladeva, and he has to-day set up a notice at
the palace gate to the above effect.&rdquo; When the king heard that,
he felt respect for him, and ordered him to be introduced, and the
warder immediately went and brought him in. The painter entered, and
beheld the king Kanakavarsha amusing himself in private with looking at
pictures, reclining his body on the lap of beautiful women, and taking
in carelessly crooked fingers the prepared betel. And the painter
Roladeva made obeisance to the king, who received him politely, and
sitting down said slowly to him&mdash;&ldquo;O king, I put up a notice
principally through the desire of beholding your feet, not out of pride
in my skill, so you must excuse this deed of mine. And you must tell me
what form I am to represent on <span class="corr" id="xd27e11712"
title="Source: canvass">canvas</span>, let not the trouble I took in
learning this accomplishment be thrown away, O king.&rdquo; When the
painter said this to the king, he replied, &ldquo;Teacher, paint
anything you will, let us give our eyes a treat: what doubt can there
be about your skill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king said this, his courtiers exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Paint
the king: what is the use of painting others, ugly in comparison with
him?&rdquo; When the painter heard this, he was pleased, and painted
the king, with aquiline nose, with almond-shaped fiery eye, with broad
forehead, with curly black hair, with ample breast, glorious with the
scars of wounds inflicted by arrows and other weapons, with handsome
arms resembling the trunks of the elephants that support the quarters,
with waist capable of being spanned with the hand, as if it had been a
present from the lion-whelps conquered by his might, and with thighs
like the post for fastening the elephant of youth, and with beautiful
feet, like the shoots of the <i>a&#347;oka</i>. And all, when they
beheld that life-like likeness of the king, applauded that painter, and
said to him; &ldquo;We do not like to see the king alone on the
picture-panel, so paint on it one of these queens by his side,
carefully choosing one, that will be a worthy pendant to him; let the
feast of our eyes be complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they said this, the painter looked at the picture and said,
&ldquo;Though there are many of these queens, there is none among them
like the king, and I believe there is no woman on the earth a match for
him in beauty, except one princess&mdash;listen, I will tell you about
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Vidarbha there is a prosperous town named
Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina, and in it there is a king of the name of
Deva&#347;akti. And he has a queen named Anantavat&iacute;, dearer to
him than life, and by her there was born to him a daughter <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540" name=
"pb540">540</a>]</span>named Madanasundar&iacute;. How could one like
me presume to describe her beauty with this one single tongue, but so
much will I say. When the Creator had made her, through delight in her
he conceived a desire to make another like her, but he will not be able
to do it even in the course of <i>yugas</i>. That princess, alone on
the earth, is a match for this king in shape, beauty and refinement, in
age and birth. For I, when I was there, was once summoned by her by the
mouth of a maid, and I went to her private apartments. There I beheld
her, freshly anointed with sandal unguent, having a necklace of
lotus-fibres, tossing on a bed of lotuses, being fanned by her
ladies-in-waiting with the wind of plantain leaves, pale and emaciated,
exhibiting the signs of love&rsquo;s fever. And in these words was she
dissuading her ladies occupied in fanning her,&mdash;&lsquo;O my
friends, away with this sandal unguent and these breezes wafted by
plantain leaves; for these, though cool, scorch up unhappy me.&rsquo;
And when I saw her in this state, I was troubled to divine the reason,
and after doing obeisance, I sat down in front of her. And she said,
&lsquo;Teacher, paint such a form as this on <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11729" title="Source: canvass">canvas</span> and give it
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then she made me paint a certain very handsome youth,
slowly tracing out the form on the ground with trembling,
nectar-distilling hand, to guide me. And when I had so painted that
handsome youth, I said to myself&mdash;&lsquo;She has made me paint the
god of Love in visible form; but, as I see that the flowery bow is not
represented in his hand, I know that it cannot be the god of Love, it
must be some extraordinarily handsome young man like him. And her
outburst of love-sickness has to do with him. So I must depart hence,
for this king, her father Deva&#347;akti, is severe in his justice, and
if he heard of this proceeding of mine, he would not overlook
it.&rsquo; Thus reflecting, I did obeisance to that princess
Madanasundar&iacute;, and departed, honoured by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I was there, O king, I heard from her attendants, as
they talked freely together, that she had fallen in love with you from
hearing of you only. So I have secretly taken a picture of that
princess on a sheet of <span class="corr" id="xd27e11736" title=
"Source: canvass">canvas</span>, and have come here quickly to your
feet. And when I beheld your majesty&rsquo;s appearance, my doubt was
at an end, for it was clearly your majesty that the princess caused to
be painted by my hand. And as it is not possible to paint her twice,
such as she is, I will not represent her in the picture as standing at
your side, though she is equal to you in beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Roladeva said this, the king said to him&mdash;&ldquo;Then shew
her as she is represented on the <span class="corr" id="xd27e11741"
title="Source: canvass">canvas</span> you have brought with you.&rdquo;
Then the painter looked out a piece of <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e11744" title="Source: canvass">canvas</span> which was in a bag,
and shewed the king Madanasundar&iacute; in a painting. And the king
Kanakavarsha, seeing that even in a painting she was wonderfully
beautiful, immediately became <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb541"
href="#pb541" name="pb541">541</a>]</span>enamoured of her. And he
loaded that painter with much gold, and taking the picture of his
beloved, retired into his private apartments. There he remained with
his mind fixed on her alone, abandoning all occupations, and his eyes
were never satisfied with gazing on her beauty. It seemed as if the god
of love was jealous of his good looks, for now that he had obtained an
opportunity, he tormented him, smiting him with his arrows and robbing
him of his self-control. And the love-pain, which he had inflicted on
women enamoured of his handsome shape, was now visited on that king a
hundredfold.</p>
<p>And in the course of some days, being pale and emaciated, he told to
his confidential ministers, who questioned him, the thought of his
heart. And after deliberating with them, he sent to the king
Deva&#347;akti, as ambassador, to ask for the hand of his daughter, a
trustworthy Br&aacute;hman of good birth, named Sangamasv&aacute;min,
who was skilled in affairs, knew times and seasons, and could speak in
a sweet and lofty style. That Sangamasv&aacute;min went to Vidarbha
with a great retinue, and entered the city of Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina. And
there he had a formal interview with the king Deva&#347;akti, and on
behalf of his master asked for the hand of his daughter. And
Deva&#347;akti reflected&mdash;&ldquo;I must give away this daughter of
mine to some one, and this king Kanakavarsha has been described as my
equal, and he asks for her; so I will give her to him.&rdquo;
Accordingly he granted the prayer of Sangamasv&aacute;min, and the king
displayed to the ambassador the astonishing elegance in the dance of
his daughter Madanasundar&iacute;. Then the king sent away, after
honouring him, and promising to give his daughter, that
Sangamasv&aacute;min, who was charmed with his sight of her. And he
sent with him a counter-ambassador to say, &ldquo;Fix an auspicious
moment and come here for the marriage. And Sangamasv&aacute;min
returned, accompanied by the counter-ambassador, and told the king
Kanakavarsha that his object was effected. Then the king ascertained a
favourable moment, and honoured that ambassador, and heard from him
over and over again how Madanasundar&iacute; was in love with him. And
then the king Kanakavarsha set out for the city of Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina,
in order to marry her, with mind at ease on account of his own
irresistible valour, mounted on the horse A&#347;&iacute;kala,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11752src" href="#xd27e11752" name=
"xd27e11752src">3</a> and he smote the &#346;avaras that inhabited the
border-forests, and took the lives of living creatures, like lions and
other wild beasts. And he reached Vidarbha, and entered that city of
Ku&#7751;&#7693;ina, with king Deva&#347;akti, who came out to meet
him. Then he entered the king&rsquo;s palace, in which preparations had
been made for the marriage, robbing the ladies of the city of the feast
which he had given to their eyes. And there he rested a day with his
retinue, pleased at the noble reception which king Deva&#347;akti gave
him. And on the next day Deva&#347;akti gave him his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href="#pb542" name=
"pb542">542</a>]</span>daughter Madanasundar&iacute;, together with all
his wealth, retaining only his kingdom.</p>
<p>And king Kanakavarsha, after he had remained there seven days,
returned to his own city with his recently-married bride. And when he
arrived with his beloved, giving joy to the world, like the moon with
the moonlight, that city was full of rejoicing. Then that queen
Madanasundar&iacute; was dearer than life to that king, though he had
many wives, as Rukmi&#7751;&iacute; is to Vish&#7751;u. And the wedded
couple remained fastened together by their eyes with lovely eyelashes,
which were fixed on one another&rsquo;s faces, resembling the arrows of
love. And in the meanwhile arrived the lion of spring, with a train of
expanding filaments for mane, tearing to pieces the elephant of female
coyness. And the garden made ready blossoming mango-plants, by way of
bows for the god of Love, with rows of bees clinging to them by way of
bowstring. And the wind from the Malaya mountain blew, swaying the
love-kindled hearts of the wives of men travelling in foreign lands, as
it swayed the suburban groves. And the sweetly-speaking cuckoos seemed
to say to men, &ldquo;The brimming of the streams, the flowers of the
trees, the digits of the moon wane and return again, but not the youth
of men.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11762src" href="#xd27e11762" name=
"xd27e11762src">4</a> Fling aside coyness and quarrelling, and sport
with your beloved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that time king Kanakavarsha went with all his wives to a
spring-garden, to amuse himself. And he eclipsed the beauty of the
<i>a&#347;okas</i> with the red robes of his attendants, and with the
songs of his lovely ladies the song of the cuckoos and bees. There the
king, though all his wives were with him, amused himself with
Madanasundar&iacute; in picking flowers and other diversions. And after
roaming there a long time, the king entered the God&aacute;var&iacute;
with his wives to bathe, and began the water-game. His ladies surpassed
the lotuses with their faces, with their eyes the blue water-lilies,
with their breasts the couples of Brahmany ducks, with their hips the
sandbanks, and when they troubled the bosom of the stream, it showed
frowns of anger in the form of curling waves. Then the mind of
Kanakavarsha took pleasure in them, while they displayed the contours
of their limbs in the splashing-game. And in the ardour of the game, he
splashed one queen with water from his palms on her breast.</p>
<p>When Madanasundar&iacute; saw it, she was jealous, and got angry
with him, and in an outburst of indignation said to him, &ldquo;How
long are you going to trouble the river?&rdquo; And going out of the
water, she took her other clothes and rushed off in a passion to her
own palace, telling her ladies of that fault of her lover&rsquo;s. Then
king Kanakavarsha, seeing her state of mind, stopped his water-game,
and went off to her apartments. Even the parrots in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href="#pb543" name=
"pb543">543</a>]</span>cages warned him off in wrath, when he
approached, and entering he saw within the queen afflicted with wrath:
with her downcast lotus-like face supported on the palm of her left
hand, with tear-drops falling like transparent pearls. And she was
repeating, with accents charming on account of her broken speech, in a
voice interrupted with sobs, shewing her gleaming teeth, this fragment
of a Pr&aacute;krit song: &ldquo;If you cannot endure separation, you
must cheerfully abandon anger. If you can in your heart endure
separation, then you must increase your wrath. Perceiving this clearly,
remain pledged to one or the other; if you take your stand on both, you
will fall between two stools.&rdquo; And when the king saw her in this
state, lovely even in tears, he approached her bashfully and timidly.
And embracing her, though she kept her face averted, he set himself to
propitiate her with respectful words tender with love. And when her
retinue signified her scorn with ambiguous hints, he fell at her feet,
blaming himself as an offender. Then she clung to the neck of the king,
and was reconciled to him, bedewing him with the tears that flowed on
account of that very annoyance. And he, delighted, spent the day with
his beloved, whose anger had been exchanged for good-will, and slept
there at night.</p>
<p>But in the night he saw in a dream his necklace suddenly taken from
his neck, and his crest-jewel snatched from his head, by a deformed
woman. Then he saw a Vet&aacute;la, with a body made up of the limbs of
many animals, and when the Vet&aacute;la wrestled with him, he hurled
him to earth. And when the king sat on the Vet&aacute;la&rsquo;s back,
the demon flew up with him through the air, like a bird, and threw him
into the sea. Then, after he had with difficulty struggled to the
shore, he saw that the necklace was replaced on his neck, and the
crest-jewel on his head. When the king had seen this, he woke up, and
in the morning he asked a Buddhist mendicant, who had come to visit him
as an old friend, the meaning of the dream. And the mendicant answered
clearly&mdash;&ldquo;I do not wish to say what is unpleasant, but how
can I help telling you when I am asked? The fact that you saw your
necklace and crest-jewel taken away, means that you will be separated
from your wife and from your son. And the fact that, after you had
escaped from the sea, you found them again, means that you will be
reunited with them, when your calamity comes to an end.&rdquo; Then the
king said, &ldquo;I have not a son as yet, let him be born
first.&rdquo; Then the king heard from a reciter of the
R&aacute;m&aacute;ya&#7751;a, who visited his palace, how king
Da&#347;aratha endured hardship to obtain a son; and so there arose in
his mind anxiety about obtaining a son, and the mendicant having
departed, the king Kanakavarsha spent that day in despondency.</p>
<p>And at night, as he was lying alone and sleepless upon his bed, he
saw a woman enter without opening the door. She was modest and gentle
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name=
"pb544">544</a>]</span>appearance, and, when the king bowed before her,
she gave him her blessing and said to him: &ldquo;Son, know that I am
the daughter of V&aacute;suki the king of the snakes, and the elder
sister of thy father, Ratnaprabh&aacute; by name. I always dwell near
thee, invisible, to protect thee, but to-day, seeing thee despondent, I
have displayed to thee my real form. I cannot bear to behold thy
sorrow, so tell me the cause.&rdquo; When the king had been thus
addressed by his father&rsquo;s sister, he said to her: &ldquo;I am
fortunate, mother, in that you shew me such condescension. But know
that my anxiety is caused by the fact that no son is born to me. How
can people like myself help desiring that, which even heroic saints of
old days, like Da&#347;aratha and others, desired for the sake of
obtaining <i>svarga</i>.&rdquo; When the N&aacute;g&iacute;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11783src" href="#xd27e11783" name=
"xd27e11783src">5</a> Ratnaprabh&aacute; heard this speech of that
king, she said to her brother&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;My son, I will tell
thee an admirable expedient, carry it out. Go and propitiate
K&aacute;rtikeya with a view to obtain a son. I will enter thy body,
and by my power thou shalt support the rain of K&aacute;rtikeya falling
on thy head to impede thee, difficult to endure. And after thou hast
overcome a host of other impediments, thou shalt obtain thy
wish.&rdquo; When the N&aacute;g&iacute; had said this, she
disappeared, and the king spent the night in bliss.</p>
<p>The next morning he committed his realm to the care of his
ministers, and went, desiring a son, to visit the sole of
K&aacute;rtikeya&rsquo;s foot. There he performed a severe penance to
propitiate that lord, having power given him by the N&aacute;g&iacute;
that entered his body. Then the rain of Kum&aacute;ra<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11816src" href="#xd27e11816" name="xd27e11816src">6</a> fell
on his head like thunderbolts, and continued without ceasing. But he
endured it by means of the N&aacute;g&iacute; that had entered his
body. Then K&aacute;rtikeya sent Ga&#7751;e&#347;a to impede him still
further. And Ga&#7751;e&#347;a created in that rain a very poisonous
and exceedingly terrible serpent, but the king did not fear it. Then
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a, invincible<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11827src"
href="#xd27e11827" name="xd27e11827src">7</a> even by gods, came in
visible form, and began to give him bites on the breast. Then king
Kanakavarsha, thinking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href=
"#pb545" name="pb545">545</a>]</span>that he was a foe hard to subdue,
proceeded, after he had endured that ordeal, to propitiate
Ga&#7751;e&#347;a with praises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour to thee, O god of the projecting belly, adorned with
the elephant&rsquo;s ornament, whose body is like a swelling pitcher
containing success in all affairs! Victory to thee, O elephant-faced
one, that makest even Brahm&aacute; afraid, shaking the lotus, which is
his throne, with thy trunk flung up in sport! Even the gods, the
Asuras, and the chief hermits do not succeed, unless thou art pleased,
the only refuge of the world, O thou beloved of &#346;iva! The chief of
the gods praise thee by thy sixty-eight sin-destroying names, calling
thee the pitcher-bellied, the basket-eared one,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11837src" href="#xd27e11837" name="xd27e11837src">8</a> the chief
of the Ga&#7751;as, the furious <i>mast</i> elephant, Yama the
noose-handed, the Sun, Vish&#7751;u, and &#346;iva. With these names to
the number of sixty-eight, corresponding to so many parts of the body,
do they praise thee. And when one remembers thee, and praises thee, O
Lord, fear produced by the battle-field, by the king&rsquo;s court, by
gambling, by thieves, by fire, by wild beasts, and other harms,
departs.&rdquo; With these laudatory verses, and with many others of
the same kind, king Kanakavarsha honoured that king of impediments. And
the conqueror of impediments said, &ldquo;I will not throw an
impediment in thy way, obtain a son,&rdquo; and disappeared then and
there from the eyes of that king.</p>
<p>Then K&aacute;rtikeya said to that king, who had endured the rain;
&ldquo;Resolute man, I am pleased with thee, so crave thy boon.&rdquo;
Then the king, delighted, said to the god, &ldquo;Let a son be born to
me by thy favour.&rdquo; Then the god said, &ldquo;Thou shalt have a
son, the incarnation of one of my Ga&#7751;as, and his name shall be
Hira&#7751;yavarsha on the earth.&rdquo; And then the rider on the
peacock summoned him to enter his inmost shrine, in order to shew him
special favour.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11854src" href="#xd27e11854"
name="xd27e11854src">9</a> Thereupon the N&aacute;g&iacute; left his
body invisibly, for females do not enter the house of K&aacute;rtikeya
through dread of a curse. Then king Kanakavarsha entered the
sanctifying temple of that god, armed only with his human excellence.
When the god saw that he was deprived of the excellence he formerly
had, because he was no longer inhabited by the N&aacute;g&iacute;, he
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; And K&aacute;rtikeya,
perceiving by his divine meditation, that that king had performed a
very difficult vow by the secret help of the N&aacute;g&iacute;, thus
cursed him in his wrath: &ldquo;Since thou didst make use of deceit,
intractable man, thou shalt be separated from thy son, as soon as he is
born, and from thy queen. When the king heard this curse, terrible as a
thunderstroke, he was not amazed, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb546" href="#pb546" name="pb546">546</a>]</span>being a mighty poet,
praised that god with hymns. Then the six-faced god, pleased with his
well turned language, said to him; &ldquo;King, I am pleased with thy
hymns; I appoint thee this end of thy curse; thou shalt be separated
from thy wife and son for one year, but after thou hast been saved from
three great dangers, thou shalt come to an end of the
separation.&rdquo; When the six-faced god had said this, he ceased to
speak, and the king, satisfied with the nectar of his favour, bowed
before him, and went to his own city.</p>
<p>Then, in course of time, he had a son born to him by queen
Madanasundar&iacute;, as the nectar-stream is born of the light of the
cold-rayed moon. When the king and queen saw the face of that son,
being filled with great delight, they were not able to contain
themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11870src" href="#xd27e11870"
name="xd27e11870src">10</a> And at that time the king made a feast, and
showered riches, and made his name of Kanakavarsha<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11882src" href="#xd27e11882" name="xd27e11882src">11</a> a
literal fact on the earth.</p>
<p>When five nights had passed, while guard was being kept in the
lying-in-house, on the sixth night a cloud suddenly came there. It
swelled, and gradually covered the whole sky, as a neglected enemy
overruns the kingdom of a careless king. Then the <i>mast</i> elephant
of the wind began to rush, showering drops of rain like drops of ichor,
and rooting up trees. At that moment a terrible woman, sword in hand,
opened the door, though it was bolted, and entered that
lying-in-chamber. She took that babe from the queen as she was nursing
it, and ran out, having bewildered the attendants. And then the queen,
distracted, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Alas! a R&aacute;kshas&iacute; has
carried off my child,&rdquo; pursued that woman, though it was dark.
And the woman rushed on and plunged into a tank with the child, and the
queen, pursuing her, plunged in also, eager to recover her offspring.
Immediately the cloud disappeared, and the night came to an end, and
the lamentation of the attendants was heard in the lying-in-chamber.
Then the king Kanakavarsha, hearing it, came to the lying-in-chamber,
and seeing it empty of his son and wife, was distracted. After he had
recovered consciousness, he began to lament, &ldquo;Alas, my queen!
Alas, my infant son!&rdquo; and then he called to mind that the curse
was to end in a year. And he exclaimed, &ldquo;Holy Skanda, how could
you give to ill-starred me a boon joined with a curse, like nectar
mixed with poison? Alas! how shall I be able to pass a year, long as a
thousand years, without the queen Madanasundar&iacute;, whom I value
more than my life?&rdquo; And the king, though exhorted by the
ministers, who knew the circumstances, did not recover his composure,
which had departed with his queen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb547"
href="#pb547" name="pb547">547</a>]</span></p>
<p>And in course of time he left his city, distracted with a paroxysm
of love, and wandered through the Vindhya forest in a state of
bewilderment. There, as he gazed on the eyes of the young does, he
remembered the beauty of the eyes of his beloved, and the bushy tails
of the <i>chamar&iacute;s</i> reminded him of the loveliness of her
luxuriant hair, and when he marked the gait of the female elephant, he
called to mind the languid grace of her gait, so that the fire of his
love broke out into a fiercer flame. And wandering about exhausted with
thirst and heat, he reached the foot of the Vindhya mountains, and,
after drinking the water of a stream, he sat down at the foot of a
tree. In the meanwhile a long-maned lion came out of a cavern of the
Vindhya hills, uttering a roar which resembled a loud demoniac laugh,
and rushed towards him to slay him. At that very moment a certain
Vidy&aacute;dhara descended rapidly from heaven, and cleft that lion in
two with a sword-stroke. And that sky-goer, coming near, said to the
king, &ldquo;King Kanakavarsha, how have you come to this
region?&rdquo; When the king heard it, he recovered his memory, and
said to him, &ldquo;How do you know me, who am tossed with the wind of
separation?&rdquo; Then the Vidy&aacute;dhara said, &ldquo;I, when in
old time I was a religious mendicant, of the name of Bandhumitra, dwelt
in your city. Then you helped me in my rites, when I respectfully asked
you to do so, and so I obtained the rank of a Vidy&aacute;dhara, by
making a goblin my servant. Thus I recognized you, and being desirous
to confer on you a benefit by way of recompense, I have slain this lion
which I saw on the point of killing you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my name has now become Bandhuprabha.&rdquo; When the
Vidy&aacute;dhara said this, the king conceived an affection for him,
and said, &ldquo;Ah! I remember, and this friendship has been nobly
acted up to by you, so tell me when I shall be reunited with my wife
and son.&rdquo; When the Vidy&aacute;dhara Bandhuprabha heard that, he
perceived it by his divine knowledge, and said to the
king&mdash;&ldquo;By a pilgrimage to the shrine of Durg&aacute;, in the
Vindhya hills, you will recover your wife and son, so go you to
prosperity, and I will return to my own world.&rdquo; When he had said
this, he departed, and king Kanakavarsha, having recovered his
self-command, went to visit that shrine of Durg&aacute;.</p>
<p>As he was going along, a great and furious wild elephant, stretching
out its trunk, and shaking its head, charged him in the path. When the
king saw that, he fled by a way full of holes, so that the elephant,
pursuing him, fell into a chasm and was killed. Then the king, fatigued
with toil and exertion, slowly going along, reached a great lake full
of lotuses with straight upstanding stalks. There the king bathed,
drank the water of the lake, and ate the fibres of the lotuses, and
lying tired at the foot of a tree, was for a moment overpowered by
sleep. And some &#346;avaras, returning that way from hunting, saw that
king with auspicious marks lying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb548"
href="#pb548" name="pb548">548</a>]</span>asleep. And they immediately
bound him, and took him to their king Mukt&aacute;phala, in order that
he might serve as a victim. The king of the &#346;avaras, for his part,
seeing that the king was a suitable victim, took him to the temple of
Durg&aacute; to offer him up. And when the king saw the goddess, he
bowed before her, and by her mercy and the favour of Skanda his bonds
fell off. When the king of the &#346;avaras saw that miracle, he knew
that it was a mark of the goddess&rsquo;s favour towards him, and he
spared his life. So Kanakavarsha escaped the third danger, and
accomplished the year of his curse.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the N&aacute;g&iacute;, the aunt of the king,
came there, bringing the queen Madanasundar&iacute; with her son, and
said to the king&mdash;&ldquo;O king, when I heard the curse of
K&aacute;rtikeya, I took these away by an artifice to my own dwelling,
and preserved them there. Therefore, Kanakavarsha, receive here your
wife and son, enjoy this empire of the earth, for now your curse is at
an end.&rdquo; When the N&aacute;g&iacute; had said this to the king,
who bowed before her, she disappeared, and the king looked upon the
arrival of his wife and child as a dream. Then the grief of separation
of the king and queen, who had so long been forced to live apart,
trickled away in their tears of joy. Then Mukt&aacute;phala, the king
of the &#346;avaras, fell at the feet of the king Kanakavarsha, on
finding that he was his master, the lord of the whole earth. And after
he had propitiated him, and persuaded him to visit his town, he
furnished his wife and child with all kinds of luxuries, such as it was
in his power to give. Then the king, remaining there, summoned by
messengers his father-in-law Deva&#347;akti and his army<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11907src" href="#xd27e11907" name=
"xd27e11907src">12</a> from his own city. Then he sent on in front of
him his beloved wife Madanasundar&iacute;, mounted on a female
elephant, and his son, who K&aacute;rtikeya said was to be called
Hira&#7751;yavarsha, and went with his father-in-law towards his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11913src" href=
"#xd27e11913" name="xd27e11913src">13</a> And in a few days he reached
the residence of his father-in-law, a hermitage in the country of
Vidarbha, and after that his wealthy city of <span class="corr" id=

there he remained some time with his wife and son, and his army, being
entertained by his father-in-law. And setting out thence, he at last
reached his own town of Kanakapura, where he was, as it were, drunk in
by the eyes of the wives of the citizens, long desirous of beholding
him again. And with his son and Madanasundar&iacute; he entered the
palace, like an embodied feast, accompanied with joy and splendour. And
there he gave Madanasundar&iacute; a turban of honour, and made her his
<span class="corr" id="xd27e11921" title="Source: headwife">head

triumph.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11924src" href="#xd27e11924" name=

this circle of the earth, four-limited by the sea, without opponents,
in perpetual happiness, with his wife and son, without experiencing
again the grief of separation.</p>
<p>When the prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta heard this magnificent tale
from his head minister Gomukha, in the company of the fair
Alank&aacute;ravat&iacute;, he was exceedingly delighted.</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the Br&aacute;hman Chandrasv&aacute;min, his
son Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, and his daughter Chandravat&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once lived in a town called Devakamalapura,
belonging to the king Kamalavarman, an excellent Br&aacute;hman, named
Chandrasv&aacute;min. And that wise man had a wife like himself,
distinguished for modesty, and she was a worthy match for
Sarasvat&iacute; and Lakshm&iacute;. And to that Br&aacute;hman was
born a son with auspicious marks, and when he was born, this voice was
heard from heaven:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chandrasv&aacute;min, you must call your son
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11947src" href=
"#xd27e11947" name="xd27e11947src">1</a> because he shall be a king and
long protect the earth.&rdquo; When Chandrasv&aacute;min heard this, he
made a feast and called that son Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la. And in course
of time Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la grew up, and was taught the science of
missile and hand to hand weapons, and was at the same time instructed
in all knowledge. And in the meanwhile his wife Devamati brought forth
to Chandrasv&aacute;min another child, a daughter, beautiful in all her
limbs. And the brother and sister, Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la and
Chandravat&iacute;, grew up together in their father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Then a famine, caused by want of rain, sprang up in that country,
the corn having been scorched up by the rays of the sun. And owing to
that, the king began to play the bandit, leaving the right path, and
taking wealth from his subjects unlawfully. Then, as that land was
going rapidly to ruin, Chandrasv&aacute;min&rsquo;s wife said to her
husband: &ldquo;Come to my father&rsquo;s house, let us leave this
city, for our children will perish here some day or other.&rdquo; When
Chandrasv&aacute;min heard this, he said to his wife&mdash;&ldquo;By no
means, for flight from one&rsquo;s own country in time of famine is a
great sin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href="#pb550" name=
"pb550">550</a>]</span>So I will take these children and deposit them
in your father&rsquo;s house, and do you remain here; I will return
soon. She agreed, and then Chandrasv&aacute;min left her in his house,
and taking those two children, the boy Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la and the
girl Chandravat&iacute;, set out from that city for his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house. And in course of time, as he roamed on, he
reached a great wilderness, with sands heated by the rays of the sun,
and with but a few parched up trees in it. And there he left his two
children, who were exhausted with thirst, and went to a great distance
to look for water for them. Then there met him a chief of the
&#346;avaras, named Sinhadansh&#7789;ra, with his followers, going
somewhere or other for his own ends. The Bhilla saw him and questioned
him, and finding out that he was in search of water, said to his
followers, &ldquo;Take him to some water,&rdquo; at the same time
making a sign to them. When they heard it, two or three of the
&#346;avara king&rsquo;s followers, perceiving his intention, took the
innocent Chandrasv&aacute;min to the village, and fettered him. And he,
learning from them that he was fettered in order to be offered as a
victim, lamented for his two children that he had left in the wild:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la! Ah dear Chandravat&iacute;! why
did I foolishly abandon you in the wilderness and make you the prey of
lions and tigers? And I have brought myself also into a position where
I am sure to be slain by bandits, and there is no escape for me.&rdquo;
While he was thus lamenting in his terror, he saw to his delight the
sun. And exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah! I will fling aside bewilderment and fly
for refuge to my own lord,&rdquo; the Br&aacute;hman began to praise
the sun in the following verses&mdash;&ldquo;Hail to thee, O Lord, the
brightness residing in the near and in the remote ether, that
dispersest the internal and external darkness. Thou art Vish&#7751;u
pervading the three worlds, thou art &#346;iva the treasure-house of
blessings, thou art the supreme lord of creatures, calling into
activity the sleeping Universe. Thou deposest thy brightness in fire
and in the moon, out of pity, as it were, saying, &lsquo;Let these two
dull things shine,&rsquo; and so thou dispellest the night. When thou
risest, the R&aacute;kshasas disperse, the Dasyus have no power, and
the virtuous rejoice.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11958src" href=
"#xd27e11958" name="xd27e11958src">2</a> So, thou matchless illuminator
of the three worlds, deliver me, who take refuge with thee. Disperse
this darkness of my grief, have mercy upon me.&rdquo; When the
Br&aacute;hman had devoutly praised the sun with these and other
similar hymns, a voice was heard from
heaven&mdash;&ldquo;Chandrasv&aacute;min, I am pleased with thee, thou
shalt not be put to death, and by my favour thou shalt be reunited with
thy wife and children.&rdquo; When the divine voice had said this to
Chandrasv&aacute;min, he recovered his spirits, and remained in a state
of tranquillity, being supplied with bathing requisites and food by the
&#346;avaras. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb551" href="#pb551" name=
"pb551">551</a>]</span></p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the boy Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, left in the
wilderness with his sister, as his father did not return, remained
lamenting bitterly, supposing that some calamity had befallen him. And
in this state he was beheld by a great merchant, of the name of
S&aacute;rthadhara, who came that way, and the merchant asked him what
had happened to him. And feeling compassion, he consoled the boy, and
observing that he had auspicious marks, he took him and his sister to
his own country. There that Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la lived in the house
of that merchant, who looked upon him with all the affection of a
father for his son; and though a boy, he was occupied in the rites of
the sacred fire.</p>
<p>But one day the minister of the king T&aacute;r&aacute;varman, who
lived in the city of T&aacute;r&aacute;pura, the excellent
Br&aacute;hman Anantasv&aacute;min, came that way on business, with his
elephants, horses and foot-soldiers, and entered the house of that
merchant, being a friend of his. After he had rested, he saw the
handsome boy Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, engaged in muttering prayers and
in sacrificing to the fire, and asked his story; then the
Br&aacute;hman minister, finding that the boy was of his own caste, as
he had no children, begged the boy and his sister from the merchant.
Then the merchant, who was a Vai&#347;ya, gave him the children, and
Anantasv&aacute;min went with them to T&aacute;r&aacute;pura. There
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la remained in the house of that minister, which
abounded in wealth on account of its master&rsquo;s knowledge, and was
treated by him as a son.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Sinhadansh&#7789;ra, the king of the Bhillas,
came to Chandrasv&aacute;min, who was in captivity in that village, and
said to him; &ldquo;Br&aacute;hman, I have been ordered in a dream by
the Sun-god not to slay you but to set you free, after doing you
honour. So rise up, and go where you please.&rdquo; After saying this,
he let him go, giving him pearls and musk, and supplying him with an
escort through the forest. And Chandrasv&aacute;min, being thus set at
liberty, not finding his son and his younger sister in the wood,
wandered in search of them, and as he wandered he found a city named
Jalapura on the shore of the sea, and entered as a guest the house of a
certain Br&aacute;hman. There, after he had taken refreshment, and then
told his story, the Br&aacute;hman, the master of the house, said to
him; &ldquo;A merchant named Kanakavarman came here some days ago; he
found in the forest a Br&aacute;hman boy with his sister, and he has
gone off with those two very handsome children to the great island of
N&aacute;rikela, but he did not tell his name.&rdquo; When
Chandrasv&aacute;min heard that, he made up his mind that those
children were his, and he determined to go to that beautiful island.
And after he had spent the night, and looked about him, he made
acquaintance with a merchant, named Vish&#7751;uvarman, who was about
to go to the isle of N&aacute;rikela. And with him he embarked in a
ship, and went across the sea to the island, out of love for his
children. When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name=
"pb552">552</a>]</span>he began to enquire there, the merchants, who
lived there, said to him; &ldquo;It is true that a merchant named
Kanakavarman did come here, with two beautiful Br&aacute;hman children,
whom he found in a wood. But he has now gone with them to the island of
Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha. When the Br&aacute;hman heard that, he went in a
ship with the merchant D&aacute;navarman to the island of
Ka&#7789;&aacute;ha. There he heard that the merchant Kanakavarman had
gone from that island to an island named Karp&uacute;ra. In the same
way he visited in turn the islands of Karp&uacute;ra, Suvar&#7751;a,
and Sinhala with merchants, but he did not find the merchant whom he
was in search of. But from the people of Sinhala he heard that that
merchant Kanakavarman had gone to his own city, named
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a. Then Chandrasv&aacute;min went with a
merchant, named Ko&#7789;&iacute;&#347;vara, to
Chitrak&uacute;&#7789;a, crossing the sea in his ship. And in that city
he found the merchant Kanakavarman, and longing for his children, he
told him the whole story. Then Kanakavarman, when he knew the cause of
his grief, showed him the children, whom he had found in the forest and
brought away. But when Chandrasv&aacute;min looked at those two
children, he saw that they were not his, but some other children. Then
he, being afflicted with tears and grief, lamented in desperate
mood&mdash;&ldquo;Alas! though I have wandered so far, I have not found
my son or my daughter. Malignant Providence, like a wicked master, has
held out hopes to me but has not fulfilled them, and has made me wander
far and wide on a false surmise.&rdquo; While he was indulging in such
lamentations, he was at last, though with difficulty, consoled by
Kanakavarman, and exclaimed in his grief, &ldquo;If I do not find those
children in a year, by wandering over the earth, I will abandon the
body by austerities on the bank of the river Ganges. When he said this,
a certain seer there said to him, &ldquo;Go, you will recover your
children by the favour of N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute;. When he
heard that, he was delighted, remembering the compassion shown him by
the sun, and he departed from that city, honoured by the merchants.</p>
<p>Then, searching the lands which were royal grants to
Br&aacute;hmans, and the villages and the towns, he reached one evening
a wood with many tall trees in it. There he made a meal on fruits and
water, and climbed up into a tree to spend the night there, dreading
the lions, and tigers, and other noisome beasts. And being sleepless,
he saw in the night at the foot of the tree a great body of divine
Mothers assembled, with N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute; at their
head; waiting for the arrival of the god Bhairava, having brought with
them all kinds of presents suited to their resources. And thereupon the
Mothers asked N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute; why the god delayed,
but she laughed and gave no reason. And being persistently questioned
by them, she answered&mdash;&ldquo;He has stopped to curse a Guhyaka
who has incurred his displeasure.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11974src" href="#xd27e11974" name="xd27e11974src">3</a> And on
account of that business some delay has taken place <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb553" href="#pb553" name=
"pb553">553</a>]</span>about his arrival, but know that he will be here
soon. While N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute; was saying this to the
Mothers, there came there Bhairava<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11979src"
href="#xd27e11979" name="xd27e11979src">4</a> the lord of the company
of Mothers. And he, having been honoured with gifts by all the Mothers,
spent some time in dancing, and sported with the witches.</p>
<p>And while Chandrasv&aacute;min was surveying that from the summit of
a tree, he saw a slave belonging to
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute;, and she saw him. And as chance
would have it, they fell in love with one another, and the goddess
N&aacute;r&aacute;ya&#7751;&iacute; perceived their feelings. And when
Bhairava had departed, accompanied by the witches, she, lingering
behind, summoned Chandrasv&aacute;min who was on the tree. And when he
came down, she said to him and her slave: &ldquo;Are you in love with
one another?&rdquo; And they confessed the truth, and said they were,
and thereupon she dismissed her anger and said to Chandrasv&aacute;min,
&ldquo;I am pleased with thee for confessing the truth, so I will not
curse thee, but I will give thee this slave, live in happiness.&rdquo;
When the Br&aacute;hman heard this, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Goddess,
though my mind is fickle, I hold it in check, I do not touch a strange
woman. For this is the nature of the mind, but bodily sin should be
avoided.&rdquo; When that firm-souled Br&aacute;hman said this, the
goddess said to him&mdash;&ldquo;I am pleased with thee and I give thee
this boon: thou shalt quickly find thy children. And receive from me
this unfading lotus that destroys poison.&rdquo; When the goddess had
said this, she gave the Br&aacute;hman Chandrasv&aacute;min a lotus,
and disappeared from his eyes.</p>
<p>And he, having received the lotus, set out, at the end of the night,
and roaming along reached the city of T&aacute;r&aacute;pura, where his
son Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la and his daughter were living in the house of
that Br&aacute;hman minister Anantasv&aacute;min. There he went and
recited at the door of that minister, in order to obtain food, having
heard that he was hospitable. And the minister, having been informed by
the door-keepers, had him introduced by them, and when he saw that he
was learned, invited him to dinner. And when he was invited, having
heard that there was a lake there, named Anantahrada, that washed away
sin, he went to bathe there. While he was returning after bathing, the
Br&aacute;hman heard all round him in the city a cry of grief. And when
he asked the cause, the people said to him&mdash;&ldquo;There is in
this city a Br&aacute;hman boy, of the name of Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la,
who was found in the forest by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb554"
href="#pb554" name="pb554">554</a>]</span>merchant S&aacute;rthadhara.
The minister Anantasv&aacute;min, observing that he had auspicious
marks, with some difficulty begged him and his sister from the
merchant, and brought them both here. And being without a son, he has
adopted the boy, whose excellent qualities have endeared him to king
T&aacute;r&aacute;varman and his people. To-day he has been bitten by a
poisonous snake; hence the cry of grief in the city.&rdquo; When
Chandrasv&aacute;min heard that, he said to himself, &ldquo;This must
be my son,&rdquo; and reflecting thus, he went to the house of that
minister as fast as he could. There he saw his son surrounded by all,
and recognized him, and rejoiced, having in his hand the lotus that was
an antidote to snake-poison. And he put that lotus to the nose of that
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, and the moment he smelt it, he was free from
the effects of poison. And Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la rose up, and was as
one who had just awoke from sleep,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11994src"
href="#xd27e11994" name="xd27e11994src">5</a> and all the people in the
city, and the king rejoiced. And Chandrasv&aacute;min was honoured with
wealth by Anantasv&aacute;min, the king, and the citizens, who said
&ldquo;This is some incarnation of the divinity.&rdquo; And he remained
in the house of the minister in great comfort, honoured by him, and he
saw his son Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la and his daughter Chandravat&iacute;.
And the three, though they mutually recognized one another, said
nothing, for the wise have regard to what is expedient, and do not
discover themselves out of season.</p>
<p>Then the king <span class="corr" id="xd27e12005" title=
"Source: T&aacute;rav&aacute;rman">T&aacute;r&aacute;varman</span>,
being highly pleased with the virtues of Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, gave
him his daughter Bandhumat&iacute;. Then that king, after giving him
the half of the kingdom, being pleased with him, laid the whole burden
of the kingdom upon him, as he had no other son. And
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, after he had obtained the kingdom, acknowledged
his father, and gave him a position next to his, and so lived in
happiness.</p>
<p>One day his father Chandrasv&aacute;min said to him, &ldquo;Come,
let us go to our own country to bring your mother. For if she hears
that you are the occupant of a throne, having been long afflicted, she
might think, &lsquo;How comes it that my son has forgotten me,&rsquo;
and might curse you in her anger. But one who is cursed by his father
and mother does not long enjoy prosperity. In proof of this hear this
tale of what happened long ago to the merchant&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of Chakra.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12013src"
href="#xd27e12013" name="xd27e12013src">6</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the city of Dhavala there was a merchant&rsquo;s
son, named Chakra. He went on a trading voyage to
Svar&#7751;adv&iacute;pa against the will of his parents. There he
gained great wealth in five years, and in order to return embarked on
the sea in a ship laden with jewels. And when his voyage was very
nearly at an end, the sea rose up against him, troubled with a great
wind, and with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555" href="#pb555" name=
"pb555">555</a>]</span>clouds and rain. And the huge billows broke his
vessel, as if angry because he had come against the wish of his
parents. Some of the passengers were whelmed in the waves, others were
eaten by sea-monsters. But Chakra, as his allotted term of life had not
run out, was carried to the shore and flung up there by the waves.
While he was lying there in a state of exhaustion, he saw as if in a
dream, a man of black and terrible appearance come to him, with a noose
in his hand. Chakra was caught in the noose by that man, who took him
up and dragged him a long distance to a court presided over by a man on
a throne. By the order of the occupant of the throne, the
merchant&rsquo;s son was carried off by that noose-bearer, and flung
into a cell of iron.</p>
<p>In that cell Chakra saw a man being tortured by means of an iron
wheel<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12023src" href="#xd27e12023" name=
"xd27e12023src">7</a> on his head, that revolved incessantly. And
Chakra asked him,&mdash;&ldquo;Who are you, by what crime did you incur
this, and how do you manage to continue alive?&rdquo; And the man
answered&mdash;&ldquo;I am a merchant&rsquo;s son named Kha&#7693;ga,
and because I did not obey the commands of my parents, they were angry
and in wrath laid this curse upon me:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12026src" href="#xd27e12026" name="xd27e12026src">8</a>
&lsquo;Because, wicked son, you torture us like a hot wheel placed on
the head, therefore such shall be your punishment.&rsquo; When they had
said this they ceased, and as I wept, they said to me, &lsquo;Weep not,
your punishment shall only last for one month.&rsquo; When I heard
that, I spent the day in grief, and at night when I was in bed, I saw,
as if in a dream, a terrible man come. He took me off and thrust me by
force into this iron cell, and he placed on my head this burning and
ever-revolving wheel. This was my parents&rsquo; curse, hence I do not
die. And the month is at an end to-day; still I am not set free.&rdquo;
When Kha&#7693;ga said that, Chakra in pity answered him&mdash;&ldquo;I
too did not obey my parents, for I went abroad to get wealth against
their will, and they pronounced against me the curse that my wealth,
when acquired, should perish. So I lost in the sea my whole wealth,
that I had acquired in a foreign island. My case is the same as yours.
So what is the use of my life? Place this wheel on my head. Let your
curse, Kha&#7693;ga, depart.&rdquo; When Chakra said this, a voice was
heard in the air &ldquo;Kha&#7693;ga, thou art released, so place this
wheel on the head of Chakra.&rdquo; When Kha&#7693;ga heard this, he
placed the wheel on the head of Chakra, and was conveyed by some
invisible being to his parents&rsquo; house. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb556" href="#pb556" name="pb556">556</a>]</span></p>
<p>There he remained without disobeying again the orders of his
parents: but Chakra put that wheel upon his head, and then spake
thus&mdash;&ldquo;May other sinners also on the earth be released from
the result of their sins; until all sins are cancelled, may this wheel
revolve on my head.&rdquo; When the resolute Chakra said this, the gods
in heaven, being pleased, rained flowers and thus addressed him:
&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo! man of noble spirit, this compassion has cancelled
thy sin, go; thou shalt possess inexhaustible wealth.&rdquo; When the
gods said this, that iron wheel fell from the head of Chakra, and
disappeared somewhere. Then a Vidy&aacute;dhara youth descended from
heaven, and gave him a valuable treasure of jewels, sent by Indra
pleased with his self-abnegation, and taking Chakra in his arms,
carried him to his city named Dhavala, and departed as he had come.
Then Chakra delighted his relations by his arrival at the house of his
parents, and, after telling his adventures, remained there without
falling away from virtue.</p>
<p>When Chandrasv&aacute;min had told this story, he said again to
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, &ldquo;Such evil fruits does opposition to
one&rsquo;s parents produce, my son, but devotion to them is a
wishing-cow of plenty: in illustration of this hear the following
tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">There was in old time a hermit of great austerity, who
roamed in the forest. And one day a hen-crow, as he was sitting under
the shade of a tree, dropped dirt upon him, so he looked at the crow
with angry eyes. And the crow, as soon as he looked at it, was reduced
to ashes; and so the hermit conceived a vain-glorious confidence in the
might of his austerities.</p>
<p>Once on a time, in a certain city, the hermit entered the house of a
Br&aacute;hman, and asked his wife for alms. And that wife, who was
devoted to her husband, answered him, &ldquo;Wait a little, I am
attending upon my husband.&rdquo; Then he looked at her with an angry
look, and she laughed at him and said, &ldquo;Remember,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12049src" href="#xd27e12049" name=
"xd27e12049src">9</a> I am not a crow.&rdquo; When the hermit heard
that, he sat down in a state of astonishment, and remained wondering
how she could possibly have come to know of the fate of the crow. Then,
after she had attended upon her husband in the oblation to the fire and
in other rites, the virtuous woman brought alms, and approached that
hermit. Then the hermit joined his hands in the attitude of
supplication, and said to that virtuous woman: &ldquo;How did you come
to know of my adventure with the crow in the forest; tell me first, and
then I will receive your alms?&rdquo; When the hermit said this, that
wife, who adored her husband, said, &ldquo;I know of no virtue other
than devotion to my husband, accordingly by his favour I have such
power of discernment. But go and visit a man here who lives by selling
flesh, whose name is Dharmavy&aacute;dha, from him thou shalt learn the
secret of blessedness free from the consciousness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href="#pb557" name="pb557">557</a>]</span>of
self.&rdquo; The hermit, thus addressed by the all-knowing faithful
wife, took the portion of a guest, and after bowing before her,
departed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next day he went in search of that
Dharmavy&aacute;dha, and approached him, as he was selling flesh in his
shop. And as soon as Dharmavy&aacute;dha saw the hermit, he said,
&ldquo;Have you been sent here, Br&aacute;hman, by that faithful
wife?&rdquo; When the hermit heard that, he said to Dharmavy&aacute;dha
in his astonishment,&mdash;&ldquo;How come you to have such knowledge,
being a seller of flesh?&rdquo; When the hermit said this,
Dharmavy&aacute;dha answered him&mdash;&ldquo;I am devoted to my father
and mother, that is my only object in life. I bathe after I have
provided them with the requisites for bathing, I eat after I have fed
them, I lie down after I have seen them to bed; thus it comes to pass
that I have such knowledge. And being engaged in the duties of my
profession, I sell only for my subsistence the flesh of deer and other
animals slain by others, not from desire of wealth. And I and that
faithful wife do not indulge self-consciousness, the impediment of
knowledge, so the knowledge of both of us is free from hindrance.
Therefore do you, observing the vow of a hermit, perform your own
duties, without giving way to self-consciousness, with a view to
acquiring purity, in order that you may quickly attain the supreme
brightness.&rdquo; When he had been thus instructed by
Dharmavy&aacute;dha, he went to his house and observed his practice,
and afterwards he returned satisfied to the forest. And by his advice
he became perfected, and the faithful wife and Dharmavy&aacute;dha also
attained perfection by such performance of their duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the power of those who are devoted to husband or
father and mother. So come, visit that mother who longs for a sight of
you.&rdquo; When thus addressed by his father Chandrasv&aacute;min,
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la promised to go to his native land to please his
mother. And he disclosed that of his own accord to Anantasv&aacute;min
his spiritual father, and when he took upon him the burden of his
kingdom, the king set out with his natural father by night. And at last
he reached his own country, and refreshed his mother Devamati with a
sight of him, as the spring refreshes the female cuckoo. And
Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la stayed there some time with his mother, being
welcomed by his relations, together with his father who related their
adventures.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile in T&aacute;r&aacute;pura the princess, his wife
Bandhumat&iacute;, who was sleeping within the house, woke up at the
close of night. And discovering that her husband had gone somewhere,
she was distressed at her lonely state, and could not find solace in
the palace, the garden, or any other place. But she remained weeping,
shedding tears that seemed to double her necklace, intent on
lamentation only, desiring relief by death. But the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb558" href="#pb558" name=
"pb558">558</a>]</span>minister Anantasv&aacute;min came and comforted
her with hope-inspiring words, saying, &ldquo;Before your husband went,
he said to me, &lsquo;I am going away on some business and I will
quickly return,&rsquo; so do not weep, my daughter.&rdquo; Then she
recovered self-control, though with difficulty. Then she remained
continually honouring with gifts excellent Br&aacute;hmans, that came
from a foreign country, in order to obtain news of her husband. And she
asked a poor Br&aacute;hman, named Sangamadatta, who came for a gift,
for tidings of her husband, having told him his name and the signs by
which to recognize him. Then the Br&aacute;hman said, &ldquo;I have
never beheld a man of that kind; but, queen, you must not give way to
excessive anxiety on this account. Doers of righteous actions
eventually obtain reunion with loved ones, and in proof of that I will
tell you a wonder which I saw, listen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Story of the king Tribhuvana.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am a king named Tribhuvana in the city of
Tribhuvana. There a certain P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic for a long
time paid me court. And being asked the reason by me, he at once asked
me to be his ally in obtaining a sword concealed in a cavern, and I
agreed to that. Then the P&aacute;&#347;upata ascetic went with me at
night, and having by means of a burnt-offering and other rites
discovered an opening in the earth, the ascetic said to me,
&ldquo;Hero! enter thou first, and after thou hast obtained the sword,
come out, and cause me also to enter; make a compact with me to do
this.&rdquo; When he said this, I made that compact with him, and
quickly entered the opening, and found a palace of jewels. And the
chief of the Asura maidens who dwelt there came out from the palace,
and out of love led me in, and there gave me a sword. She said,
&ldquo;Keep this sword which confers the power of flying in the air,
and bestows all magical faculties.&rdquo; Then I remained there with
her. But I remembered my compact, and going out with the sword in my
hand, I introduced that ascetic into the palace of the Asuras by that
opening. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb559" href="#pb559" name=
"pb559">559</a>]</span>There I dwelt with the first Asura lady who was
surrounded by her attendants, and he dwelt with the second. One day
when I was <span class="corr" id="xd27e12088" title=
"Source: stupified">stupefied</span> with drinking, the ascetic
treacherously took away from my side the sword, and grasped it in his
own hand. When he had it in his grasp, he possessed great power, and
with his hand he seized me and flung me out of the cavern. Then I
searched for him for twelve years at the mouths of caverns, hoping that
some time I might find him outside. And this very day the scoundrel has
presented himself to my eyes, sporting with that very Asura lady who
belongs to me.</p>
<p>While the king Tribhuvana was relating this to me, O queen, that
ascetic, stupefied with drink, went to sleep. And while he was asleep,
the king went and took the sword from his side, and by its operation he
recovered celestial might. Then the hero woke up that ascetic with a
kick, and reproached the unfortunate man, but did not kill him. And
then he entered the palace with the Asura lady and her attendants,
recovered again like his own magic power. But the ascetic was much
grieved at having lost his magic power. For the ungrateful, though long
successful, are sure to fail at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having seen this with my own eyes, I have now arrived here in
the course of my wanderings; so be assured, queen, that you shall
eventually be reunited to your beloved, like Tribhuvana, for the
righteous does not sink.&rdquo; When Bandhumat&iacute; heard that from
the Br&aacute;hman, she was highly delighted, and made him successful
by giving him much wealth.</p>
<p>And the next day a distinguished Br&aacute;hman came there from a
distant land, and Bandhumat&iacute; eagerly asked him for tidings of
her husband, telling his name and the tokens by which he might be
recognized. Then that Br&aacute;hman said to her: &ldquo;Queen, I have
not seen your husband anywhere, but I, who have to-day come to your
house, am named not without reason, the Br&aacute;hman
Sumanas,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12097src" href="#xd27e12097" name=

<h3 class="main">Story of Nala and Damayant&iacute;.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of old time there lived a king named Nala, whose
beauty, I fancy, so surpassed that of the god of Love, that in disgust
he offered his body as a burnt-offering in the fire of the eye of the
enraged &#346;iva. He had no wife, and when he made enquiries, he heard
that Damayant&iacute;, the daughter of Bh&iacute;ma the king of
Vidarbha, would make him a suitable wife. And Bh&iacute;ma, searching
through the world, found that there was no king except Nala fit to
marry his daughter.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Damayant&iacute; went down into a tank in her own
city, to amuse herself in the water. There the girl saw a swan that had
fed on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb560" href="#pb560" name=
"pb560">560</a>]</span>blue and white lotuses, and by a trick she threw
over it her robe and made it a prisoner in sport. But the celestial
swan, when captured, said to her in accents that she could understand:
&ldquo;Princess, I will do you a good turn, let me go. There is a king
of the name of Nala, whom even the nymphs of heaven bear on their
hearts, like a necklace strung with threads of merit.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e12114src" href="#xd27e12114" name="xd27e12114src">13</a> You
are a wife fitted for him and he is a husband suited for you, so I will
be an ambassador of Love to bring like to like.&rdquo; When she heard
that, she thought that the celestial swan was a polished speaker, and
so she let him go, saying&mdash;&ldquo;So be it<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e12119" title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;And she said,
&ldquo;I will not choose any husband but Nala,&rdquo; having her mind
captivated by that prince, who had entered by the channel of her
ear.</p>
<p>And the swan departed thence, and quickly repaired to a tank
resorted to by Nala, when bent on sporting in the water. And Nala,
seeing that the swan was beautiful, took it captive out of curiosity by
throwing his robe over it in sport. Then the swan said&mdash;&ldquo;Set
me free, O king, for I have come to benefit you; listen, I will tell
you. There is in Vidarbha one Damayant&iacute;, the daughter of king
Bh&iacute;ma, the Tilottam&aacute; of the earth, to be desired even by
gods. And she has chosen you as her future husband, having fallen in
love with you on account of my description of your virtues; and I have
come here to tell you. Nala was at the same time pierced with the words
of that excellent swan, that were brightened by the splendid object
they had in view,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12124src" href=
"#xd27e12124" name="xd27e12124src">14</a> and with the sharp arrows of
the god of the flowery shafts. And he said to that swan, &ldquo;I am
fortunate, best of birds, in that I have been selected by her, as if by
the incarnate fulfilment of my wishes.&rdquo; When the swan had been
thus addressed by him and let go, it went and related the whole
occurrence to <span class="corr" id="xd27e12127" title=
"Source: Dayamant&iacute;">Damayant&iacute;</span>, as it took place,
and then went whither it would.</p>
<p>Now Damayant&iacute; was longing for Nala; so, by way of a device to
obtain him, she sent her mother to ask her father to appoint for her
the ceremony of the Svayamvara. And her father Bh&iacute;ma consented,
and sent messengers to all the kings on the earth, to invite them to
the Svayamvara. And all the kings, when they had received the summons,
set out for Vidarbha, and Nala went also eagerly, mounted on his
chariot.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile, Indra and the other Lokap&aacute;las heard
from the hermit N&aacute;rada of the Svayamvara of Damayant&iacute;,
and of her love for Nala. And of them Indra, the Wind, the god of Fire,
Yama and Varu&#7751;a, longing for Damayant&iacute;, deliberated
together, and went to Nala, and they found Nala setting off on the
journey, and when he prostrated himself before them, they said to him
&ldquo;Go, Nala, and tell Damayant&iacute; this from
us&mdash;&lsquo;Choose one of us five; what is the use of choosing Nala
who is a mortal? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href="#pb561"
name="pb561">561</a>]</span>Mortals are subject to death, but the gods
are undying.&rsquo; And by our favour, thou shalt enter where she is,
unperceived by the others.&rdquo; Nala said &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; and
consented to do the errand of the gods. And he entered the apartments
of Damayant&iacute; without being seen, and delivered that command of
the gods, exactly as it was given. But when the virtuous woman heard
that, she said &ldquo;Suppose the gods are such, nevertheless Nala
shall be my husband, I have no need of gods.&rdquo; When Nala had heard
her utter this noble sentiment, and had revealed himself, he went and
told it, exactly as it was said, to Indra and the others; and they,
pleased with him, gave him a boon, saying, &ldquo;We are thy servants
from this time forth, and will repair to thee as soon as thought of,
truthful man.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Then Nala went delighted to Vidarbha, and Indra and the other gods
assumed the form of Nala, with intent to deceive Damayant&iacute;. And
they went to the court of Bh&iacute;ma, assuming the attributes of
mortals, and, when the Svayamvara began, they sat near Nala. Then
Damayant&iacute; came, and leaving the kings who were being proclaimed
one by one by her brother, gradually reached Nala. And when she saw six
Nalas, all possessing shadows and the power of winking,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12141src" href="#xd27e12141" name=
"xd27e12141src">15</a> she thought in her perplexity, while her brother
stood amazed, &ldquo;Surely these five guardians of the world have
produced this illusion to deceive me, but I think that Nala is the
sixth here, and so I cannot go in any other direction.&rdquo; When the
virtuous one had thus reflected, she stood facing the sun, with mind
fixed on Nala alone, and spoke thus&mdash;&ldquo;O guardians of the
world, if even in sleep I have never fixed my heart on any but Nala, on
account of that loyal conduct of mine shew me your real forms. And to a
maiden any other men than her lover previously chosen are strangers,
and she is to them the wife of another, so how comes this delusion upon
you?&rdquo; When the five, with Indra at their head, heard that, they
assumed their own forms, and the sixth, the true Nala, preserved his
true form. The princess in her delight cast upon the king her eye,
beautiful as a blown blue lotus, and the garland of election. And a
rain of flowers fell from heaven. Then king Bh&iacute;ma performed the
marriage ceremony of her and Nala. And the kings and the gods, Indra
and the others, returned by the way that they came, after due honour
had been done to them by the king of Vidarbha.</p>
<p>But Indra and his companions saw on the way Kali and
Dv&aacute;para,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12159src" href="#xd27e12159"
name="xd27e12159src">16</a> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb562"
href="#pb562" name="pb562">562</a>]</span>knowing that they had come
for Damayant&iacute;, they said to them, &ldquo;It is of no use your
going to Vidarbha; we come thence; and the Svayamvara has taken place;
Damayant&iacute; has chosen king Nala. When the wicked Kali and
Dv&aacute;para heard that, they exclaimed in wrath, &ldquo;Since she
has chosen that mortal in preference to gods like thyself, we will
certainly separate that couple.&rdquo; After making this vow they
turned round and departed thence. And Nala remained seven days in the
house of his father-in-law, and then departed, a successful man, for
Nishada, with his wife Damayant&iacute;. There their love was greater
than that of &#346;iva and P&aacute;rvat&iacute;. P&aacute;rvat&iacute;
truly is half of &#346;iva, but Damayant&iacute; was Nala&rsquo;s self.
And in due time Damayant&iacute; brought forth to Nala a son named
Indrasena, and after that a daughter named Indrasen&aacute;.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile Kali, who was resolved on effecting what he had
promised, was seeking an occasion against Nala, who lived according to
the &#346;&aacute;stras. Then, one day, Nala lost his senses from
drunkenness, and went to sleep without saying the evening prayer and
without washing his feet. After Kali had obtained this opportunity, for
which he had been watching day and night, he entered into the body of
Nala. When Kali had entered his body, king Nala abandoned righteous
practices and acted as he pleased. The king played dice, he loved
female slaves, he spoke untruths, he slept in the day, he kept awake at
night, he became angry without cause, he took wealth unjustly, he
despised the good, and he honoured the bad.</p>
<p>Moreover Dv&aacute;para entered into his brother Pushkara, having
obtained an opportunity, and made him depart from the true path. And
one day Nala saw, in the house of his younger brother Pushkara, a fine
white bull, named D&aacute;nta. And Pushkara would not give the bull to
his elder brother, though he wanted it and asked for it, because his
respect for him had been taken away by Dv&aacute;para. And he said to
him, &ldquo;If you desire this bull, then win it from me at once at
play.&rdquo; When Nala heard that challenge, in his infatuation he
accepted it, and then those two brothers began to play against each
other. Pushkara staked the bull, Nala staked elephants and other
things, and Pushkara continually won, Nala as continually lost. In two
or three days Nala had lost his army and his treasure, but he still
refused to desist from gambling, though entreated to desist, for he was
distracted by Kali. Damayant&iacute;, thinking that the kingdom was
lost, put her children in a splendid chariot, and sent them to the
house of her father. In the mean-while Nala lost his whole kingdom;
then the hypocritical Pushkara said, &ldquo;Since you have lost
everything else, now stake Damayant&iacute; on the game against that
bull of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This windy speech of Pushkara&rsquo;s, like a strong blast, made
Nala blaze like fire; but he did not say anything unbecoming, nor did
he stake his wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb563" href="#pb563"
name="pb563">563</a>]</span>Then Pushkara said to him, &ldquo;If you
will not stake your wife, then leave this country of mine with
her.&rdquo; When Nala heard this, he left that country with
Damayant&iacute;, and the king&rsquo;s officers saw him as far as the
frontier. Alas! when Kali reduced Nala to such a state, say, what will
be the lot of other mortals, who are like worms compared with him?
Curse on this gambling, the livelihood of Kali and Dv&aacute;para,
without law, without natural affection, such a cause of misfortunes
even to royal sages.</p>
<p>So Nala, having been deprived of his sovereignty by his brother,
started to go to another land with Damayant&iacute;, and as he was
journeying along, he reached the centre of a forest, exhausted with
hunger. There, as he was resting with his wife, whose soft feet were
pierced with <i>darbha</i> grass, on the bank of a river, he saw two
swans arrive. And he threw his upper garment over them, to capture them
for food, and those two swans flew away with it. And Nala heard a voice
from heaven,&mdash;&ldquo;These are those two dice in the form of
swans, they have descended and flown off with your garment also.&rdquo;
Then the king sat down despondent, with only one garment on, and
providently shewed to Damayant&iacute; the way to her father&rsquo;s
house; saying, &ldquo;This is the way to Vidarbha, my beloved, to your
father&rsquo;s house, this is the way to the country of the Angas, and
this is the way to Ko&#347;ala.&rdquo; When Damayant&iacute; heard
this, she was terrified, thinking to herself&mdash;&ldquo;Why does my
husband tell me the way, as if he meant to abandon me?&rdquo; Then the
couple fed on roots and fruits, and when night came on, lay down both
of them, wearied, in the wood, on a bed of <i>ku&#347;a</i> grass. And
Damayant&iacute;, worn out with the journey, gradually dropt off to
sleep, but Nala, desiring to depart, kept awake, deluded by Kali. So he
rose up with one garment, deserting that Damayant&iacute;, and departed
thence, after cutting off half her upper garment and putting it on. But
Damayant&iacute; woke up at the end of the night, and when she did not
see in the forest her husband, who had deserted her and gone, she
thought for some time, and then lamented as follows: &ldquo;Alas, my
husband, great of heart, merciful even to your enemy! You that used to
love me so well, what has made you cruel to me? And how will you be
able to go alone on foot through the forests, and who will attend on
you to remove your weariness? How will the dust defile on the journey
your feet, that used to be stained with the pollen of the flowers in
the garlands worn on the heads of kings! How will your body, that could
not endure to be anointed with the powder of yellow sandal-wood, endure
the heat of the sun in the middle of the day? What do I care for my
young son? What for my daughter? What for myself? May the gods, if I am
chaste, procure good fortune for you alone!&rdquo; Thus
Damayant&iacute; lamented, in her loneliness, and then set out by the
path, which her husband had shewn her beforehand. And with difficulty
she crossed the woods, forests, rivers, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb564" href="#pb564" name=
"pb564">564</a>]</span>rocks, and never did she depart from her
devotion to her husband in, any point. And the might of her chastity
preserved her on the way,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12186src" href=
"#xd27e12186" name="xd27e12186src">17</a> so that the hunter, who,
after delivering her from the serpent, fell in love with her for a
moment, was reduced to ashes. Then she joined a caravan of merchants,
which she met on the way, and with them she reached the city of a king
named Sub&aacute;hu. There the daughter of the king saw her from her
palace, and pleased with her beauty, had her brought and gave her as a
present to her mother. Then she remained in attendance on the queen,
respected by her, and when questioned, she answered
only&mdash;&ldquo;My husband has abandoned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile her father Bh&iacute;ma, having heard the
tidings of Nala&rsquo;s misfortune, sent trustworthy men in every
direction, to make search for the royal couple. And one of them, his
minister named Suve&#7751;a, as he was wandering about disguised as a
Br&aacute;hman, reached that palace of Sub&aacute;hu. There he saw
Damayant&iacute;, who always examined guests, and she saw with sorrow
her father&rsquo;s minister. And having recognized one another, they
wept together so violently, that Sub&aacute;hu&rsquo;s queen heard it.
And the queen had them summoned, and asked them the truth of the
matter, and then she found out that the lady was Damayant&iacute;, the
daughter of her sister. Then she informed her husband, and after
shewing her honour, she sent her to the house of her father with
Suve&#7751;a and an army. There Damayant&iacute; remained, reunited
with her two children, enquiring under her father&rsquo;s guidance for
news of her husband. And her father sent out spies to look for her
husband, who was distinguished by preternatural skill in cooking and
driving. And king Bh&iacute;ma commanded the spies to say; &ldquo;Moon,
where have you hid yourself so cruelly, deserting your young bride
asleep in the forest, dear as a cluster of white lotuses, having taken
a piece of her robe?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12197src" href=
"#xd27e12197" name="xd27e12197src">18</a> This he told them to utter
wherever they suspected the presence of Nala.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile king Nala travelled a long way at night in that
forest, clothed with the half-garment, and at last he saw a
jungle-fire. And he heard some one exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;Great-hearted
one, take me away from the neighbourhood of this fire, in order that I,
being helpless, may not be burned up by it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e12205src" href="#xd27e12205" name="xd27e12205src">19</a> When
Nala heard this, he looked round, and beheld a snake coiled up near the
fire, having his head encircled with the rays of the jewels of his
crest,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12211src" href="#xd27e12211" name=
"xd27e12211src">20</a> as if seized on the head by the jungle-fire,
with terrible flaming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href=
"#pb565" name="pb565">565</a>]</span>weapons in its hand. He went up to
it, and in compassion put it on his shoulder, and carried it a long
distance, and when he wished to put it down, the snake said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Carry me ten steps further, counting them as you
go.<span class="corr" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Then Nala
advanced, counting the steps, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven&mdash;listen, snake&mdash;eight, nine, ten, and when he said ten
(<i>da&#347;a</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12234src" href=
"#xd27e12234" name="xd27e12234src">21</a> the snake took him at his
word, and bit him in the front of the forehead, as he lay on his
shoulder. That made the king small in the arms, deformed and black.
Then the king took down the snake from his shoulder, and said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Who art thou, and what kind of a return for my
kindness is this which thou hast made?&rdquo; When the snake heard this
speech of Nala&rsquo;s, he answered him,&mdash;&ldquo;King, know that I
am a king of the snakes named K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka, and I gave you
the bite for your good; that you will come to learn; when great ones
wish to live concealed, a deformed appearance of body furthers their
plans. Receive also from me this pair of garments, named the
&lsquo;fire-bleached,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12239src" href=
"#xd27e12239" name="xd27e12239src">22</a> you need only put them on and
you will recover your true form.&rdquo; When K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka had
said this, and had departed after giving those garments, Nala left that
wood, and in course of time reached the city of Ko&#347;ala.</p>
<p>And going by the name of Hrasvab&aacute;hu, he took service as a
cook in the family of king &#7770;itupar&#7751;a, the sovereign of
Ko&#347;ala. And he acquired renown by making dishes of exquisite
flavour, and by his skill in chariot-driving. And while Nala was living
there, under the name of Hrasvab&aacute;hu, it happened that once upon
a time one of the spies of the king of Vidarbha came there. And the spy
heard men there saying,&mdash;&ldquo;In this place there is a new cook,
of the name of Hrasvab&aacute;hu, equal to Nala in his own special art
and also in the art of driving.<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The spy suspected that the cook was Nala
himself, and hearing that he was in the judgment-hall of the king, he
went there and repeated the following &Aacute;ry&aacute; verse, taught
him by his master, &ldquo;Moon, where have you hid yourself so cruelly,
deserting your young bride asleep in the forest, dear as a cluster of
white lotuses, having taken a piece of her robe?&rdquo; The people
present in the judgment-hall, when they heard that, thought that his
words were those of a madman, but Nala, who stood there disguised as a
cook, answered him, &ldquo;What cruelty was there in the moon&rsquo;s
becoming invisible to the lotus-cluster, when it reached and entered
another region, after one part of the heaven<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12252src" href="#xd27e12252" name="xd27e12252src">23</a> had
become exhausted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the spy heard this, he surmised that the supposed cook was
really Nala transformed by misfortune, and he departed thence, and when
he reached Vidarbha, he told king Bh&iacute;ma and his queen and
Damayant&iacute; all that he had heard and seen. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb566" href="#pb566" name="pb566">566</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Damayant&iacute;, of her own accord, said to her father,
&ldquo;Without doubt that man is my husband disguised as a cook. So let
this amusing artifice be employed to bring him here. Let a messenger be
sent to king <span class="corr" id="xd27e12260" title=
"Source: &#7770;ituparna">&#7770;itupar&#7751;a</span>, and the moment
he arrives let him say to that king, &lsquo;Nala has gone off somewhere
or other, no tidings are heard of him; accordingly to-morrow morning
Damayant&iacute; will again make her Svayamvara; so come quickly to
Vidarbha this very day;&rsquo; and the moment the king hears his
speech, he will certainly come here in one day, together with that
husband of mine who is skilled in chariot-driving.&rdquo; Having thus
debated with her father, Damayant&iacute; sent off that very moment a
messenger to the city of Ko&#347;ala with exactly this message. He went
and told it, as it was given him to <span class="corr" id="xd27e12263"
title="Source: &#7770;ituparna">&#7770;itupar&#7751;a</span>, and the
king thereupon, being excited, said affectionately to his attendant
Nala, who was disguised as a cook: &ldquo;Hrasvab&aacute;hu, you
said&mdash;&lsquo;I possess skill in chariot-driving.&rsquo; So take me
this very day to Vidarbha if you have sufficient endurance.&rdquo; When
Nala heard that, he said, &ldquo;Good! I will take you there,&rdquo;
and thereupon he yoked swift horses, and made ready the splendid
chariot. He said to himself; &ldquo;Damayant&iacute; has spread this
report of a Svayamvara in order to recover me, otherwise, I know, she
would not have behaved in this way even in her dreams. So I will go
there and see what happens.&rdquo; With such reflections he brought to
<span class="corr" id="xd27e12266" title=
"Source: &#7770;ituparna">&#7770;itupar&#7751;a</span> the chariot
ready. And as soon as the king had mounted it, Nala proceeded to drive
on that chariot with a speed exceeding even that of Garu&#7693;a. Then
&#7770;itupar&#7751;a dropped his garment, and wished to stop the
chariot in order to recover it, but Nala said to
him,&mdash;&ldquo;King, where is that garment of yours? Why the chariot
has in this moment left it many <i>yojanas</i> behind.&rdquo; When
&#7770;itupar&#7751;a heard this, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, give me
this skill in chariot-driving, and I will give you my skill in dice, so
that the dice shall obey your command and you shall acquire skill in
numbers. And now look; I will give you a proof of the truth of what I
say. You see this tree in front of us; I will tell you the number of
its leaves and fruits, and then do you count them for yourself and
see.&rdquo; When he had said this, he told him the number of the leaves
and fruits on that tree, and Nala counted them and found them exactly
as many as he had said. Then Nala gave to &#7770;itupar&#7751;a his
skill in driving, and &#7770;itupar&#7751;a gave to Nala his skill in
dice and numbers.</p>
<p>And Nala tested that skill on another tree, and found the number of
leaves and fruits to be exactly what he had guessed. And while he was
rejoicing, a black man issued from his body, and he asked him who he
was. Then he said, &ldquo;I am Kali; when you were chosen by
Damayant&iacute;, I entered your body out of jealousy, so you lost your
fortune at play. And when K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka bit you in the forest,
you were not consumed, but I was burnt, as you see, being in your body.
For to whom is a treacherous injury done to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb567" href="#pb567" name=
"pb567">567</a>]</span>another likely to be beneficial? So I depart, my
friend, for I have opportunities against others.&rdquo; After saying
this, Kali vanished from his sight, and Nala at once became
well-disposed as before, and recovered his former splendour. And he
returned and remounted the chariot; and in the course of the same day
he drove king &#7770;itupar&#7751;a into Vidarbha, so rapidly did he
get over the ground, and there the king was ridiculed by the people,
who asked the cause of his coming; and he put up near the palace.</p>
<p>And when he arrived, Damayant&iacute; knew of it, having heard the
wonderful noise of the chariot, and she inly rejoiced, as she suspected
that Nala had come too. And she sent her own maid to find out the
truth, and she enquired into it, and came back and said to her
mistress, who was longing for her beloved lord; &ldquo;Queen, I have
enquired into the matter; this king of Ko&#347;ala heard a false report
of your Svayamvara and has come here, and he has been driven here in
one day by Hrasvab&aacute;hu his charioteer and cook, who is famous for
his skill in managing chariots. And I went into the kitchen and saw
that cook. And he is black and deformed, but possesses wonderful
powers. It is miraculous that water gushed up in his pots and pans,
without being put in, and wood burst into flames of its own accord,
without having been lighted,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12278src" href=
"#xd27e12278" name="xd27e12278src">24</a> and various cates were
produced in a moment. After I had seen this great miracle, I came back
here.&rdquo; When Damayant&iacute; heard this from the maid, she
reflected&mdash;&ldquo;This cook, whom the fire and the water obey, and
who knows the secret of chariot-driving, can be no other than my
husband, and I suspect he has become changed and deformed on account of
separation from me, but I will test him.&rdquo; When she had formed
this resolve, she sent, by way of stratagem, her two children with that
same maid, to shew them to him. And Nala, when he had seen his children
and taken them on his knees after a long separation, wept silently with
a flood of tears. And he said to the maid&mdash;&ldquo;I have two
children like these in the house of their maternal grandfather, I have
been moved to sorrow by recollecting them.&rdquo; The maid returned
with the children and told all to Damayant&iacute;, and then she
conceived much hope.</p>
<p>And early the next day she gave her maid this order; &ldquo;Go and
tell that cook of &#7770;itupar&#7751;a&rsquo;s from me; &lsquo;I hear
that there is no cook like you in the world, so come and prepare curry
for me to-day.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; When the maid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb568" href="#pb568" name=
"pb568">568</a>]</span>communicated to Nala this politic request, he
got leave from <span class="corr" id="xd27e12300" title=
"Source: Ritupar&#7751;a">&#7770;itupar&#7751;a</span> and came to
Damayant&iacute;. And she said, &ldquo;Tell me the truth; are you the
king Nala disguised as a cook? I am drowned in a sea of anxiety, and
you must to-day bring me safe to shore.&rdquo; When Nala heard that, he
was full of joy, love, grief and shame, and with downcast face, he
spoke, in a voice faltering from tears, this speech suited to the
occasion,&mdash;&ldquo;I am in truth that wicked Nala, hard as adamant,
who in his madness behaved like fire in afflicting you.&rdquo; When he
said this, Damayant&iacute; asked him&mdash;&ldquo;If it is so, how did
you become deformed?&rdquo; Then Nala told her the whole of his
adventures, from his making friends with K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka to the
departure of Kali from him. And immediately he put on the pair of
garments called the &ldquo;fire-bleached,&rdquo; given him by
K&aacute;rko&#7789;aka, and recovered on the spot his own original
shape.</p>
<p>When Damayant&iacute; saw that Nala had resumed his own charming
form, the lotus of her face quickly expanded, and she quenched, as it
were, with the waters of her eyes the forest-fire of her grief, and
attained indescribable unequalled happiness. And Bh&iacute;ma, the king
of Vidarbha, quickly heard that intelligence from his joyful
attendants, and coming there he welcomed Nala, who showed him becoming
respect, and he made his city full of rejoicing. Then king <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e12305" title=
"Source: Ritupar&#7751;a">&#7770;itupar&#7751;a</span> was welcomed
with the observance of all outward courtesy and every hospitable
rite<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12308src" href="#xd27e12308" name=
"xd27e12308src">25</a> by king Bh&iacute;ma, who in his heart could not
help laughing, and after he had in return honoured Nala, he returned to
Ko&#347;ala. Then Nala lived there happily with his wife, describing to
his father-in-law his outburst of wickedness due to the influence of
Kali. And in a few days he returned to Nishada with the troops of his
father-in-law, and he humbled his younger brother Pushkara, beating him
by his knowledge of dice, but, righteous as he was, he gave him a share
of the kingdom again, after Dv&aacute;para had left his body, and glad
at having recovered Damayant&iacute;, he enjoyed his kingdom
lawfully.</p>
<p>When the Br&aacute;hman Sumanas had told this story to the princess
Bandhumat&iacute; in T&aacute;r&aacute;pura, whose husband was away, he
went on to say to her&mdash;&ldquo;Even thus, queen, do great ones,
after enduring separation, enjoy prosperity, and following the example
of the sun, after suffering a decline, they rise again. So you also,
blameless one, shall soon recover your husband returning from his
absence; use patient self-control, banish grief, and console yourself
with the approaching gratification of your wishes in the return of your
husband.&rdquo; When the virtuous Br&aacute;hman had spoken these
appropriate words, she honoured him with much wealth, and taking refuge
in patience, she remained there awaiting her beloved. And in a few days
her husband Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la returned, with his father, bringing
that mother of his from a distant land. And when he returned,
furnishing a feast to all eyes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb569"
href="#pb569" name="pb569">569</a>]</span>he gladdened
Bandhumat&iacute;, as the full moon gladdens the lovely water of the
ocean. Then Mah&iacute;p&aacute;la, on whom her father had already
devolved the burden of the kingdom, enjoyed as a king desired pleasures
with her.</p>
<p>When prince Narav&aacute;hanadatta, the son of the king of Vatsa,
had heard in the company of his wife, from the mouth of his<a id=

<td class="width40 bottom">The author of Sagas from the Far East
remarks; &ldquo;Serpent-Cultus was of very ancient observance, and is
practised by both followers of Br&aacute;hmanism and Buddhism. The
Br&aacute;hmans seem to have desired to show their disapproval of it by
placing the serpent-gods in the lower ranks of their mythology,
(Lassen. I, 707 and 544, n. 2). This cultus, however, seems to have
received a fresh development about the time of A&#347;oka <i>circa</i>
250 B. C. (Vol. II, p. 467). When Madhyantika went into Cashmere and
Gandh&aacute;ra to teach Buddhism after the holding of the third synod,
it is mentioned that he found sacrifices to serpents practised there
(II. 234, 235). There is a passage in Plutarch from which it appears to
have been the custom to sacrifice an old woman (previously condemned to
death for some crime) to the serpent-gods by burying her alive on the
banks of the Indus (II. 467, note 4) Ktesias also mentions the serpent
worship (II. 642). In Buddhist legends serpents are often mentioned as
protecting patrons of certain towns. (Sagas from the Far East, p. 355).
